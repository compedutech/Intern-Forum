This summer ive got a decent internship with a bank, but in more of a data analytics role.

On one hand id love to eventually be in a quant role (like RenTec, for example) but I am also looking into IB/PE roles, and want to be open to both options as I approach the recruiting process this coming fall. 

My major is applied math/Econ. I am considering getting a minor in physics - which to my understanding would be great for a quant role (also, I enjoy it). However, it wouldnt be very applicable to IB/PE, and my gpa wouldnt be as high. If I get a minor in physics, I would expect my gpa to be around 3.4-3.5, and if it was just applied math/econ, it should be around 3.6-3.7.

Do yall think it would be smart to go for the minor? Or would I be taking an unnecessary blow to my gpa

Thanks for the help"

I have done a few part time jobs and temp jobs to make ends meet. 
During the switch I had to learn how to apply for jobs, write my resume etc. Always had been in the right place at the right time for my previous jobs up till last year. 
My issue is that I did not do internships because I was working through school, held the incorrect belief you need a 4.0 to get one and i truly thought I would be in horticulture for the rest of my life. 
So here I am im trying to make the switch.
I need an entry level job but there really aren't entry level jobs in those industries it seems. 
I have reached out to non profits to volunteer. I have yet to have any luck with that, in fact it seems like in some situations the competition  for a volunteer gig is harder. 
I have been applying like crazy for any opening I think I can land. 
SO my question is:what role or position level should I be applying for? 
You really can't get a corporate internship nor one at a small firm if you aren't in school. I apply anyway but I don't here back.
I have reached out to my school's career development center, visited good will and used my network.
Has anyone switched careers like this? What should I do? "

I have a liberal arts degree from a great university, went into teaching, it wasn't for me, and I floated around a bit until I decided I'd do a career change. I'm a full time stay at home parent and go to school part time. I was planning on doing an internship next summer, just prior to graduating, but I somehow managed to catch the attention of a highly regarded local software company. I was given an interview and offered a position.

While I was told in the interview that they don't expect the world from their interns, I am a bit nervous about being able to actually be useful. I've done well in school so far and am now at senior standing. I've done most of my work in Java, have started to really pick up and play around with Python, have started learning a lot about database design and getting familiar with MySQL, and I also really enjoyed my Numerical Methods course. I think some of my hesitancy stems from imposter syndrome. Can a former liberal arts grad actually do this, I find myself thinking. 

The president of the company called me and talked to me a bit and he made it sound as though they really do want to give the interns tasks they can succeed at, give them an idea of what a career in software engineering is actually like, and take them under their wings and mentor them. 

However, I want to make sure that I can actually contribute, that I won't just be someone always asking for help and always clueless about what to do. I have a month before I start. What particular skills can I be working on to ensure I get off to a good start? Learning my IDE's inside and out? Learning version control better? Command line? Any general skills that would help me to come in and actually be useful? Thanks for any advice you have to give."

This is going to be a slightly long post so please sit through this with me. 
I'm really having trouble making a decision as to where to go to college, and I'm torn between MIT/Yale. I went to both of their admit weekends and I liked both campus. 
I applied as engineering, but to be completely honest, I really don't know what I'm going to major at college. I'm pretty sure it's going to be STEM(mostly math or physics related) or maybe economics/finance industry.
I'm just looking for some help and opinions. Thank you!

What I like about MIT:

Academics- MIT is the better school academically for STEM majors. Easy job/internship opportunity

research opportunities- cutting edge research opportunities

summer program- I applied to a summer program at MIT that would give me a huge head start during the summer. If I get in, it's definitely going to be a game changer. But I'll only know if I commit :(

What I dislike about MIT:

Stress- The most important reason that's keeping me from committing to MIT is stress/workload. I know it's definitely not going to be easy at Yale or any other top schools (really easy classes are not what I'm looking for anyways), but I think MIT's course load is just especially stressful. I don't want to be in an environment where I'm constantly super stressed and pulling my hairs out.

social life- I'm not into the ""work hard, play hard"" model at MIT. Don't want to die on weekdays and have huge parties on weekends

What I like about Yale:

Faculty student relations- since it has a super small STEM department, class sizes are super small, and students get to know their professors very well(which I really like). I talked to one professor and he said he will literally be on my ass to help me get internships

Student body- not everyone is STEM, and I will know people from different majors doing different things in the future. There are also a lot of well known political figures coming in for speeches

Less stress- definitely not going to be easy, but not as hardcore as MIT

What I dislike about Yale:

Opportunities- smaller school means fewer opportunities. Also, I'm not too sure about this, but does coming from a less well regarded engineering/STEM school reduce my chance of finding a good job? Because I've heard many people say don't go to Yale for engineering

What I dislike about both schools:

humanities requirements- not super excited about completing my General requirements

I'm looking for some opinions here on which college is better for me. 
Thank you so much for reading!
TLDR: Trying to decide between Yale and MIT. Any help is appreciated!"

I am currently a Computer Science - Computer System Major and will graduate in May 2018.

I wish to study/research in the field of AI, but more specifically want to research on the topic of Artificial General Intelligence.


Here are some of my questions:

1) Are there any programs in the US/Canada/Europe that offer a pathway to researching in the field?


2) In the US/Canada, how would funding work for grad school? Is my PhD funded but have to pay for Masters?


3) Apart from an AI class taken during my Bachelor, a possible internship next summer in the middle-east, and side-learning the likes of Coursera's Machine Learning course, what would you recommend I delve into for a better chance to enter a program?


4) What standardized exams should I do? I have heard of the GRE, do I only need the Maths section?

For my thesis I have to do a 30 page minimum fictional peice. I decided to try fantasy/science fiction out because i love reading it, but never tried writing it. The main struggle with my peice has been plot so that means a lot of writing and rewriting. 

For my final draft I was actually happy and excited with the direction I was going in.  I had roughly 4 weeks until I had to hand it in,  I spent the last two really focusing on my first 15 pages since they needed the most work plot wise and was planning on completing the last 15 these next two weekends. I have about 37 pages of writing with 15 pages solidly completed.

But today my professor emails us saying that our thesis is now due 5 days earlier than expected. 

I know 5 days doesn't sound like alot, but he cut out an entire weekend I could have been working on it. Plus, I can't even hand it in the friday it's due because I intern in the city all day and won't be on campus so I have to hand it in the day before.

Then there's my other classes, which I'm not even thinking about. 

So I'm freaking out, this thing is due in 11 days now and writing fiction under this pressure gives me horrible writers block. It's my thesis and i want it to be something I'm proud of, but because of this sudden change I don't even know if I'm able to hand in a completed peice.

Any advice on how I'm going to finish this thing? I've always been ahead of the curb but now I'm in total panic mode. "

From 2 weeks after i started until around February things were going smoothly, i always got out by 7:30 and got out late every once in a while.

Recently my boss has been asking me for a lot more than i can handle. She's added a few things i'm supposed to clean and ever with that i still got out around the same time but now she wants me to come in at 3 but i can't have all my stuff done and ready before 4:30, she wants me to clean these dinner carts, but i can't since my coworker works slowly and i'm not going to wait for her to finish so i can get started (which is around 9:30, but cleaning those carts has always been their job), and she's been asking me to ditch my classes because someone couldn't go to work these past 2 weeks. I have 3 days off for a reason yet she's called me telling me someone didn't know they were working last week and this week someone else got sick. I'm tired, pissed off, and behind in school now.

But what's really pissing me off is she told me today that i need to get everything done by at least 8 (other wise i'm paid overtime), but with the carts it was ""okay if i stay a little past 8"". Today we finished late and i didn't leave until around 8:15, my coworker hasn't got any of the carts ready for me to clean, and i have class tomorrow.

The nurses there you'd think are saints but sometimes i feel like i know better than them when it comes to what a patient can eat. Like sometimes a patient who is allergic to milk products will ask for something with milk products. I, having an near eidetic memory, recall this person can't have this certain food yet a nurse will be oblivious to that and ask for it on behalf of that patient anyways. Yesterday we started late because there wasn't a single nurse in the dining room (we can't serve without them there). Today a nurse literally stopped me to write down the info for a new resident rather than take it to us herself. It isn't like she had it ready to go it was obviously that she didn't wanna take it herself because she wrote it down on the spot.

But i'm use to that from the nurses. I get their job is far more important but they aren't trying to be dicks about it.

Recently the residents have been ticking me off and they were originally the reason i liked my job.  i feel like a lot of them think they're entitled to whatever they want. Like i have today's dessert and that's what most patients should get, yet they'll ask for ice cream. One patient stopped me while i was talking to another patient at another table so i could attend to them like i skipped them on purpose. When I tried explaining i usually go around in a circle and they quickly denied that.

Last week a different patient was mad that he couldn't have certain food and blamed me even though i have no control over that. 

I don't like my job anymore. That short hour of interaction with the nice patients used to make up for the other 4 hours and now i just want to quit. I'm looking for a summer internship right now, i'm fairly close to getting one, but it's unpaid so i need a job. i don't know if i wanna stay there because there are some patients i do like and i think they'd be disappointed if i left"
68k215,1,2017-05-01,Lost college student looking for answers,sydactylion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/68k215/lost_college_student_looking_for_answers/,"I'm starting my junior year in college this fall, and I've been stressed about what the hell I'm doing since the beginning. I've never had a clear idea of what I wanted to do ""when I grow up."" I've dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety that have clouded that. I do honestly love school though. This past semester I FINALLY declared a major (english), and I spent a lot of time trying to decide between a history or psychology minor (because those were things I was interested in but not looking for a career in). I went with psych. 

But I had a conversation a few weeks ago with my now ex that has kind of sent me into an existential crisis. I was going through a bit of a depressive episode due to stress, and he went on a tangent about how I needed to find goals to drive me. He is studying to be a doctor, but in his words ""career isn't enough."" He wants to go to space and help kids in war zones and eventually retire. Those, on top of his career, are the things that drive him.

I've always had difficulty with long-term goals because I never knew what I wanted to do. My goals have always been vague-- be happy, experience life. The english major-- writing, critical thinking-- it makes me happy, and I'd like a career in editing or technical writing or something along those lines. But all the people around me, my ex's friends, they have goals to help people. Doctors, dentists, pharmacists. And he explained those goals that MEANT something and were outside his career. 

When I realized I don't have those, I panicked. I still don't know who I am, I don't feel like a whole person (the breakup certainly didn't help, but that's not the point). I realized the only thing I have ever felt really passionately about is animals. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet, when I started college I wanted to do biology to research animals (didn't pan out). So I started looking into internships with places like WWF. I started looking at an environmental studies minor. 

And now I'm at a crossroads. I changed my schedule around and realized this minor is extremely hard to schedule because my school rarely offers the classes needed, so it doesn't give me much time for work or volunteering (which I need lots of time for for my school's honors program). Let alone extracurriculars and social time, which I am trying to get more of as I've neglected these things the past two years, and self-care. On top of this, the classes don't look at all like something I would enjoy. They stress me out more than anything.

My question is, is the minor worth it? I know minors don't mean much, but I don't want to use my time on a psych minor I will never use just because I enjoy it and then find out the environmental studies minor would have given me the opportunity to help out in conservation or animal rescue or SOMETHING. But I also don't want to stress myself out so much, make my schedule absolutely horrible, and take classes I won't enjoy at all for a minor that won't mean shit. And how do I ever flesh out and achieve this goal of ""helping animals/the environment?"" I always thought I would become a researcher and help save animals from poachers or something (I was young lol). Anything I can think of isn't anywhere close to my ex's ""helping kids in war zones."" 

And while I'm here... how the hell do I make these kinds of goals that drive me? Are the goals of ""be happy"" and ""experience life"" shitty goals? How do I find what I want, How do I find who I am? I don't feel like a person, at least not a whole one. I don't have an identity compared to all these people I know who seem so sure in what they're doing. I'm starting to question my entire existence.

TLDR: I can minor in psychology which I find interesting and offers flexibility in my schedule, or I can minor in environmental studies which is nothing but stress but is the only way I can think of that may or may not help me ""make a difference."" Don't know what my goals in life are, if a minor will even matter in the end, or how I can accomplish my half-baked goal of making a difference by helping animals/the environment. Is this all just a waste of time?"

When I tried to do practice/ HW questions, it would be like I didn't just spend all that time studying.

The facts:

* The company is SaaS based and I work as a front end dev. 
* The company is located in Atlantic Canada.
* I work with HTML/CSS, Javascript, and React daily, and I'm expected to start a transition into server side responsibilities in the near future. 
* I am expected to be proficient with design.
* I have about 7 years of experience with web design, and 3 years with web development (I got into the stuff at a young age).
* I just graduated from university (BSc Computer Science).
* Currently salary is $42,000 yearly.

My question is, what should I ask for as a pay bump? The current national median for a front end dev is ~63k (the mean of the medians from Indeed, PayScale, and GlassDoor). The top scale average would sit at around ~80-100k. 

This is a huge range so I'm a bit flustered when I think of how to approach the negotiation when the time comes.

Columbia seems less tech-oriented and more business-oriented, which is my main concern, while Cornell is kinda in the middle of nowhere and Cornell seems to have a heavy workload with lots of weed-out classes. I want to go somewhere I'm not severely overworked because I struggle with depression at times, and I want a manageable workload and be able to have good internship opportunities and a job in a tech company in the end. I also havent had good experience with CS teachers in high school so I'm also hoping for good professors! Which school would you guys suggest? Thank you very much in advance"

I'm currently a sophomore in college majoring in CS. So far, I've gotten A's in all my CS classes, but I still feel like I'm behind my peers when it comes to programming knowledge. I have minimal outside projects and no additional programming knowledge outside my classes. In my classes we have learned Java and C so far (and Assembly but that doesn't really count).

Since I want to stay competitive in getting internships and jobs, I want to begin learning on my own. I was thinking about learning web development (maybe JavaScript?) and creating a website. However, I don't know if learning a software like Node.js is better. I also know Python is useful to know, so I don't know if that's better to learn.

I would appreciate any advice anyone has to give.
Thank you"

I'm a university student and I need to do a final internship in order to graduate. I applied at a reputable company (thousands of employees &amp; a worldwide known brand). Two weeks ago on friday I was called by HR, and they asked me to call the manager in order to set a date for an interview. 


I called the manager, but he was in a meeting and told me that he would call me back on Tuesday. However, he didn't call. So I decided to call him on Wednesday and again he told me he was busy. He proposed to call me on monday and put it in his calendar. 

Its monday, the work day is over, and he still hasn't called. Should I call him back tomorrow, or just leave it (and wait)? 
I've already called twice and he didn't make the effort to call back, I feel as if I come off as desperate? I'm not experienced with this and I feel like I could use some advice on this, and I would highly appreciate it.

I am a third year university student and I currently have 2 different offers for a summer internship. They are essentially the same role with similar responsibilities. I know I would enjoy working with the people at either company. Office perks mostly the same.

Company A:
$15/hr
35min-1 hr commute with traffic
Large, well-known global tech company 
Internship not extendable past summer

Company B:
$18/hr
8 minute commute
Very small, 20 person tech company with a lot of potential to grow
Internship extendable past summer
Travel to tradeshows around the U.S.

I really want this internship to extend during the school year to help with finances. However, being a third year I need my experience and internship this summer to put me in the best position possible of securing a full time job when I graduate next year. The exposure and recognizability of the larger company on my resume would surely help in this area. The commute is a major downside, coupled with the lower pay makes the other offer more attractive. I just don't want to shoot myself in the foot with a small, unknown company when I apply for larger tech companies next year. 

What company would you choose?

I'm a software developer. Graduated with a double-BS in Computer Science and Mathematics, did alright in my undergrad, 3.4 GPA. Not a top university but I got a lot out of it and made connections. Did a lot in my undergrad. Software internship over the summer, TAed an applied machine learning course my senior year.

I got hired on graduation and have been at this same place the whole time. Job description is pretty broad. I do mostly back-end development mostly in Java. Recently took the lead on a new project, designing, planning, organizing a small team. It's a small organization, and I set up most of the development infrastructure myself. I don't get paid much, $50k, but I'm working on things I care about.

The problem is that I'm a total mental trainwreck and I've just fucked up all my shit. I can't communicate with people, I just can't, and it fucks me up whenever I try. Being out in public fucks me up. Being in the office fucks me up. I can't get anything done when I'm in the office. I've lost my mind, I'm paranoid, and whenever I'm in the office I can hear my coworkers talking and I'm sure they're talking about me and wtf is my problem. I'm so fucked up.

I can do my job remotely, from home. I get so much done there. I love it. But I am just *capable* of working remotely. I'm not supposed to. I've been reminded of that several times. Next time might be the last. I wish I could stop myself, but I don't know how to control it, I just break down. I broke down last week, started having panic attacks. Ditched work, worked from home the whole week. Got a ton of shit done. Got chewed out today. And that's when I made the mistake of telling my boss the truth about my anxiety problems. Why why why the fuck did I think that was a good idea. Guess I can say goodbye to that promotion. Promotions are for the mentally stable.

I'd hoped to build off of this job, network with the people here, build a career. I really don't think that's gonna happen now. All of a sudden, this is starting to look like a dead-end. I need to find a job that I can do, and *for obvious reasons* I have to be able to do it remotely. Ideally with as little human contact as possible. I have a solid skill set, I can do good work, but I can't count on having references because, again, total fucking wreck.

Needless to say, I do not generally perform well in job interviews. But I can jump off that bridge when I get to it.

What career options are available to a capable lunatic like me?"

68p50e,0,2017-05-01,When is internship competition unfair?,Sentherus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68p50e/when_is_internship_competition_unfair/,"This question was motivated by a recent experience I had where I was passed over for a software engineering internship at a local company. 

I am relatively competent for a college junior/senior, and I was interested in applying to intern at one of the companies in the area whose application requirements I met. I knew a few people in the company from elsewhere and, from what I had heard, it sounded like a great place to work. They would provide a laptop on which I could do work, allow me, as an intern, to work from home for 20% or so of my hours (Which is fantastic for me since I don't have my own car), and their hourly pay was double what I am currently making. So I was understandably excited when I got the email for a phone interview. 

Fast forward about a week. The phone interview went great and I was brought in for an on-site interview. At this point, from what I had heard from my friend in the company, I was one of the two applicants that had been brought in for an on-site interview. So, I was excited to make a good impression and I feel I did. I got into a few conversations with some of the interviewers before the actual interview began and we talked about our own hobbies, interests, favorite programming languages and editors, as well as some design patterns.
The interview itself went nicely, from what I've heard of interviews (This was my first). The team was extremely nice, and did their best to make the experience calm and professionally relaxed. I answered every question I could as completely as I could, but also admitted when I didn't have a lot of experience when answering other questions. Overall, from what I heard from my friend, they liked me.

Fast forward another couple weeks or so when I hear from my friend that the company's management in another state had accepted an application from a professor of engineering (Whose interest was in passing time during the summer break) at one of the many local high school after the application period was completed. This professor, who holds a masters degree, was then brought in to interview and selected for the internship by management. Note that the team I interviewed and the management which decided who to go with were two different groups, and from what I had heard there was some disagreement between these two groups over who to go with.

Given all this, it led me to questioning how I should feel about the whole experience. I'm not sure if I should be upset with myself because of my lack of experience, which was ultimately my failure, or wary of the company for choosing based on experience when the position in question is an internship position, meant to provide experience.
I am also concerned that the fact that I feel as if this opportunity was in a sense 'taken' from me reflects more on my hubris than on the situation actually being unfair, as the position was never really mine to begin with.

I'm going to be trying to get more experience on my own time to make myself a better candidate in the future, but I'm still left with this question which boils down to whether or not this kind of competition is actually unfair. I'm not sure I can answer it on my own because I don't have other experiences to judge this experience against. So, I was wondering if anyone here might be able to help me.

TL;DR: Lost internship to someone who was probably older and vastly more experienced than I was. When does the competition for an internship position become unfair?"

My grades are declining and I hate my major and internship but dont have the money to stay for another few years to try getting a degree in something else. I don't think I've actually experienced any sort of sustained happiness in years, and basically all of my friends I still have remaining I rarely see because of distance, and I fear they wouldn't still talk to me at all if they saw how much of a pathetic sack of shit I have become.

I don't want to hurt the few people who do care about me, but I'm becoming even further and more distant from them everyday so the only motivation I have to not end my worthless existence is nearly gone, since it's easier to get the courage to stab myself than to try grinding through another miserable few decades."

I started my masters last September. I applied to a few programs after a couple of years working in the field (and a couple years suffering from PTSD) because I wanted to apply to something I knew I would be interested in. I knew what good research situations looked like, and I tried to only apply to labs that would allow me to be in a good research situation myself.


Despite all my plans, only one position with funding was offered to me. It looked alright so I accepted...and immediately regretted my decision. The school and my project-to-be did not interest me. BUT- I had a few months to kill before my program started so I went to get more experience with an internship in the field in the meantime. I hoped I would eventually feel better about accepting the position, but as the starting date of my program grew closer and closer my regret only intensified. Leaving the internship was one of the hardest things I have ever done, but I had accepted the position so I had to go.


I have considered quitting every. single. day. since. Absolutely every day. But, I have never quit anything in my life, (I hoped I would eventually grow to like it) and the idea of quitting something like this and the consequences terrifies me. My problem is, that the thought of staying here terrifies me as well. I have gone from the happiest and most inspired months of my life to months of the most boredom and apathy I have ever experienced.

My supervisor is very nice and very impressive, but I go months at a time without speaking to her. She doesn't have an open door policy and takes days to reply to emails. My co-supervisor is exactly the same, except she works from home, so if I have a quick, but important question it is an ordeal to get it answered and stalls my progress for days. I am learning now that this is not the advising style that I should have gone for...which is my problem I know. 


I spend 8 hour days in the lab, completely alone, chipping away at plans for a field season I could not care less about. I used to LIVE for field season. I feel completely isolated from the rest of my lab who have different schedules and offices to me. My schedule does not allow for me to go to any talks or departmental seminars, something I loved doing in undergrad, and just increases my feelings of isolation.


My project is fine, but I cannot strum up any enthusiasm for it. I have been in this limbo of quitting but not quitting for so long that it doesn't feel real. I KNOW I should have made the decision to stay or leave ages ago but knowing that doesn't change the fact that I can't decide what to do. I have asked for advice from a number of people and all they will tell me is ""that's a tough choice!"" or refuse to advise me at all.

I feel my field season rapidly slipping out of my control, but I just don't care. I am self sabotaging and I can't stop. I don't know what has happened to me, I have never felt so uninspired in my life and it is paralyzing. I keep looking for an excuse I can use to quit because I don't want to disappoint my adviser, but of course none have materialized except ""I hate this"". 

I know people will tell me to stick it out, but the contrast of the me I was before I started this and the me I am right now is scary. I lost a couple years after my undergrad to PTSD, so even though it may just be a year and a bit more to go, at that internship I was FINALLY happy and excited and inspired and so full of energy for the first time in years...I just don't want to lose any more time being miserable. 

It is coming to crunch time, this month will decide everything and I am meeting with an academic counselor this week hopefully.  Basically I am wondering if I am alone in feeling this way, and how you snapped out of it? Or any advise on what I should do? Is it impossible to get in to another program if you drop out of one? I don't want to burn all my bridges here, but I haven't seen enough of anyone to really build any relationships to begin with.

Thank you!"

68rp8y,4,2017-05-02,Moving away from a physics degree,AZXXZAZXQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68rp8y/moving_away_from_a_physics_degree/,"This type of question is asked around here a lot, but I feel my situation is unique enough (I guess we all think so about ourselves) to warrant a special post. This isn't a question about learning resources or a simple ""should I quit university"" post. I put the tl;dr at the beginning. 


---------------------------------------
**tl;dr**
Guy in his mid-early 20s who realizes academia isn't for him and wants to move on to something in software. Big obstacle is that he has a lot of work to do to make his mediocre coding skills employable. Staying enrolled makes it harder to ""get good"". Only thing he has going for him is a strong math background. 
---------------------------------------

Right now I'm finishing up my second year of a physics BSc at a medium sized state university. My grades are pretty decent at around a 3.50 GPA overall, but I've realized a career in physics isn't for me. I really like coding and computers in general (specifically gotten into security/cryptography) and want to just move on with my life. 

So here's where the problems begin. I have a ton of mathematical knowledge and skills, but my programming and knowledge of computer systems is pretty mediocre. I've been working primarily with python and a little bit of bash and java. I have a long way to go before I can ask people for money without embarrassing myself. I'm not even sure exactly what type of work I'm really interested in. The way I see things, I only have three options.

1. Withdraw and try and make myself employable over the summer.
or 
2. Force myself to finish my degree over the next 2 years and try to pick up coding a long the way.
3. Switch degrees to CS and repeat an entire year.

None of these are good options. 1. is risky, and it would be pretty damn hard to even find an internship or first job within 3 or 4 months. Living next to one of the big east coast tech city might help here. 2. is proving to be really hard. After working on class work, I don't have the mental energy to put toward coding. 3. feels like a big waste of time. 

I'm not asking for anybody to make the decision for me, I just want to know the thoughts of people that are more familiar with the industry than I am.

Edit: At this point I'm leaning towards doing a double major in CS + physics. I've only got 4 physics courses to fulfill my requirements and dropping it would be stupid. All of the gen eds. and math courses carry over so it looks like I'll only be adding an extra 3 semesters. "
68rpmr,3,2017-05-02,Path to Post Graduate Studies,KyleRochi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68rpmr/path_to_post_graduate_studies/,"I am a Junior in college, and I have completed 2 years at a 4 year year university and 1 year at a community college, and will be starting my final 2 years at UC Davis in the fall. (I changed to CS my second year which is why the weird path, so I am technically a Sophomore going into my Junior year in terms of my CS degree)

I have a few personal projects, I have written a shell from scratch, and built a hexapod robot and IK engine, and I want to build a toy compiler/linker/assembler this summer, but they are more of a hobby than anything serious. I do a fair amount of self study, but not nearly as much as I would like.

I had a CS internship at a start up last summer in Palo Alto, and I am returning to the same company this summer. Last summer I was fairly autonomous and working closely with a small team in addition to helping write tools for the testing teams, and am expecting a similar experience this summer.

I am interested in possibly getting a masters (maybe a PhD after that) after I complete my BS. Obviously things may change and I fall in love with working in the industry or something, but I want to prepare for post graduate studies as well as I can, that way, if I decide to go into post graduate stuff, I will be prepared, and if I don't, it shouldn't hurt (right? :S).

My question is, what kinds of things should I start doing to prepare myself better for a future in post-graduate/research? I have been told that I should look for research assistant positions, but I don't really know what to look for or who to talk to about that kind of thing. Since I will be going to a new school I am very worried that I won't know teachers well enough to ask for positions.

Aside from research assistant positions, what else should I be doing? I have been doing some self study, and reading some research papers, but I feel like it isn't helping me career wise as much as its just a hobby. Should I try and ramp these behaviors up, or are there better things to spend my time doing to prepare myself for the future? For research oriented things, should I focus more on personal projects and try to make some more complex things, or keep doing them as a side hobby and focus on other things? If I focus on preparing for a masters program and research will that hurt my abilities to work for the private sector later on if I change my mind?

Thanks in advance! You don't have to answer my specific questions, any comments are appreciated :)"

First is SUNY Buffalo MS CS. Second is Arizona State University MS Software Engineering (though I had applied for CS).

I've been talking to people to attempt to come to a decision, but I'm finding it really difficult to do so due to the vast variety of opinions. I thought maybe you guys could provide some insight.

I'm told the factors to consider are cost, location, course, climate, and job opportunities. The cost and climate are okay with me either place, so no swinger there. 

Course wise, well, the two courses are different but some people are telling me it doesn't matter which course I do when I go for a job after MS, while others tell me the classes I take when I'm there and the campus I'm at do matter. (Note: ASU SE is at Polytechnic campus, not Tempe campus which is the main and supposedly much better.)

Location: I know ASU has the better location considering its proximity to California and Phoenix where there are a lot of jobs, but some people tell me that I shouldn't choose just for location since I can get a job, intern and such regardless of the geographical proximity to the company's location.

Overall, I don't know which to give more weightage to and swing towards. Kindly offer me your insight, advice and what suggestions you might have."
68tve5,296,2017-05-02,To those down on their luck looking for jobs,DjCuffs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68tve5/to_those_down_on_their_luck_looking_for_jobs/,"I was one of those guys who went to a state school, majored in Computer Science, loved the material and found it really interesting, but didn't really think twice about where I'd end up after school. 3.2 gpa, No internships, no projects, etc. Well as you might expect interviews were few and far between, and as you might be aware that can be really depressing especially when considering the impact of student loans if you have them.

And, I'll admit, receiving those boilerplate rejection emails, going to what few interviews I did get, thinking they go well, and boom that rejection email slides in within a day or two, it definitely leads you to a dark place.

However I thought, ""I'd take anything right now, an internship, a low offer, etc."" and even that can be hard to find. So instead I just started working on a project that incorporated the skills hiring managers would want, mostly working with full-stack web development, something my school really didn't offer any courses in.

Well after awhile I ran into a company that gave me a technical interview over the phone with the director and 2 senior developers, a rather nerve-wracking experience for the lowly junior dev.

I can tell you right now that those skills I learned on that project were directly related to my performance on the technical questions I was given, more than you could really ever hope to remember from drilling wikipedia articles about anything and everything. 

But more so than that, I'd say my performance socially really gave me the advantage above other developers and my drive to learn things, stating that I had begun those projects in lieu of professional experience such as internships. The manager was really impressed with my initiative there and we got along really well for the short hour.

Today I just received an offer that just maybe a month ago I thought would never come. All in all it took me about 4 months of catching up with my projects and research to get the offer, if that kind of time frame helps anyone else out there. My best advice to anyone in my position whose in a dark place with it all is to keep your skills sharp (constantly be improving the projects you have), relax and try and act human in your interviews, and take time to appreciate the others things in your life that aren't related to your career, such as your friends and family.

Much love to anyone who took the time to read this, good luck fellow devs :)"

I was apparently hired as the only one who knows Java. Everyone else is on the brink of retirement and specializes in old languages (PowerBuilder, CFML, COBOL). They want me to eventually rewrite their legacy apps using Oracle/Java.

Its a great opportunity to learn, but I feel like I really need a mentor. They placed me on a re-write project with the intern, who is a C.I.S major and has just been here 2 months, and is also 5 years older than me. He seems to have more practical knowledge than me and has already gotten a small webapp running, but I feel like the design is bad and disorganized/hastily written. He gave me the code repo and hardly explained any of his design choices, how things are connected, etc, I basically just spent hours reading through the code. He is not here often (few hours a day/2-3 days a week), so its tough to progress. My supervisor can't help either, since they don't know Java or what the intern was planning on designing.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I need some advice on how to handle this. I'm currently just chipping away and reading tutorials and building the program in steps.

Hello, I’m Ezra, and I can’t leave my office. I also cannot post this using anything that resembles my real name, or else the browser closes and I lose everything. Had I written this any earlier, it would probably have been filled with heat and emotion, and I’d probably have added the word “fucking” before nearly every noun, but now that it’s been about four years, I figured I can finally describe what’s happening and what led up to this objectively.     
      
I “work” from 8 AM to 4 PM at a large bank's corporate center. I'm in the communications department, meaning that I make sure that messages get delivered in a way that their recipients can understand, ranging from powerpoint presentations to infographic reports. The job is simple enough and the workload is not hard to handle. Our corporate complex has three buildings and nearly everything an employee would need inside, like restaurants, a gym, a newspaper stand... There's very little reason to go outside during work hours except maybe if you want to eat something different for lunch.    
   
When I first got this job, I was 22 years old and near the end of my college journey, needing an internship to fill up a mandatory quota of work hours that the university required. When the call came to confirm that I got chosen, it felt like I had won the jackpot. Good pay, flexible work hours, nice coworkers and all this infrastructure at my disposal? Sign me the hell up.      
       
First few months were a blast. I was finally earning enough money to buy not only the things I needed, but the things I wanted. I barely saw my abusive mother due to our conflicting work schedules, and it only got better once she moved in with her boyfriend and his kid, since I now had a very large apartment all to myself and my two cats. It got a little hard to handle after a while, so I did some redecorating and reorganizing and invited a close friend to live with me for a much more affordable price than her current place. After some getting used to, the house thrived. We bought consoles, got an awesome table for tabletop games and RPGs, our fridge was always full and we could afford godly internet.    
   
I always tear up when I try to write this part because I miss all of it like you wouldn't believe. I always try not to linger on it too much, but I can't help it. I was finally looking forward to going home from work.   
      
Now, contrary to what you might think, the point where it turned to the worst had nothing to do with my friend, my girlfriend or even my mother, it happened when I stopped going home from work. Now, that sounds pretty confusing (Trust me, I still don't quite know how it works myself) but I'll try my best to explain my experience from the start up to now (I'll be brief, of course, although I feel like I could describe every minute of these four dreadful years in detail).     
     
On a Friday evening like any other, I found myself lost in thoughts, just looking out the office window and debating whether I should call an Uber to get home. It was raining, and even though the polycarbonate coating the glass made the water slide down effortlessly, the heavy downpour made it hard to see too far out. I began putting my stuff away, clocked out, and while waiting for the elevator, tried to come up with an interesting adventure hook for the D&amp;D adventure I was running later in the night. When the door opened, I entered, and it all faded to black.      
      
I woke up to the shaking of a coworker, who looked at my groggy face and chuckled, offering to get me a coffee when he went down to the ground floor. I yawned, fighting a pounding migraine, and stretched. It was at that time that an incredibly intense pain ran through my joints and back, which made me lose my breath and fall to my knees, which were also in incredible pain. My coworker looked very worried and asked me if I had pulled something on my back, I couldn't answer. He helped me to my feet and I caught my breath, carefully stretching and waiting for the pain to subside, which it did, after a short while. Made my way to the lockers, took my stuff, swiped my card...

Then I j ust stood there, in silent realization, holding my card for what seemed like a really long time. Silently, I tried to understand what had just happened while my hands worked their magic and I autopiloted through checking my email and logging into our Lync server. I instinctively reached for my phone, grumbled as it was out of batteries and plugged in the charger.      
     
Walking into the bathroom, I noticed I was a mess. My shoulder-length hair was all over the place, my face looked like I was a hungover goblin and there were some weird black dirt stains on my clothes and body. My face lit up quickly as I noticed everyone had seen me like this, but no one had bothered to tell me. I fixed myself up and sat back down, now coming to terms with the theory that I had just gotten stupidly drunk over the weekend and that's why I was so confused. However, I could still not figure out what in the hell I had drank to make me forget three whole days, and if I really had been that drunk...     
    
There absolutely would be pictures! The sort of embarrassing shots that my friends would save up for years just to show my kids how I partied. Instinctively, I grabbed my phone again, only to realize that it hadn't been charging. It wouldn't even flash the screen when I tried to turn it on. I tried every damn electrical outlet I could and borrowed chargers, until I finally admitted that the damn thing was broken, that I had likely dropped it in water and just dried it like that'd fix it.      
    
Since dwelling on stupid drunk mistakes would likely invite a migraine, I began my workday as usual, avoiding interactions with people. I had lunch at the usual place, checked my bank account at the usual place, and went through the day just wanting it to be over so I could go home and get some answers.       
    
I finally clocked out, waited for the elevator, entered it, and as the door closed, I noticed that the monitor that usually cycled through world news and company images was just white. I found it really weird, but I shrugged it off and walked out of the elevator, to the left, got a cup of water and stopped just short of swiping my card.   
   
Now in my mind was a vivid image of the word NO in the most bombastic font possible, which was an accurate graphical representation of the sheer dread that ran down my spine. I remembered the time when I had a hit of Salvia Divinorum which basically locked me in time, particularly in the space of a verse from the song ""Feel Good Inc"". I could get up from my couch and walk to the other side of the house, but when the verse ended, I'd be right back, with the bong in my mouth, like nothing had ever happened. Darting into the accessibility toilet (which was pretty much the only place where I could actually be alone) I tried to avoid having a panic attack.    
    
A lot of people talk about experiences that only happened in their heads, but they always deal with it in the smoothest way possible, snapping out of it quickly or even playing with their subconscious. Didn't happen to me. My mind immediately started worrying that I had gone insane, that I was hallucinating in the street, everything I thought of was dangerous and it just snowballed on me until my pressure dropped and I nearly fainted. It took everything I had and more for me to get out of that bathroom, but I did, convinced that none of what was happening was real, determined to wait it out...    
    
And obviously, since you're reading this, waiting it out hasn't worked and I kept on panicking for about five days. I cooled off after that, and although sometimes I still spike up with anger and anguish, it doesn't last long.     
     
During the following weeks, I discovered that the company internet is fully functional, albeit blocking certain websites as it always has. There's also the stupid name filter I mentioned at the start. I can connect to some outside servers like Steam (That is somehow able to download games even though it never leaves offline mode), but not IMs like Discord. It only works while wired, thus I can only use the internet at all while at my station.   
   
Some other things of note are that I cannot access the seven highest floors, the garage or the ground floor. Outside of those, I can navigate freely and use the complex's services with no issue. People act like they normally would, but can never recall anything that I say about the fact that I can't leave, nor the numerous times I have ran around without hope, tried to throw myself out the window or had sex with them.     
    
I am absolutely certain I saw some new people appear every so often, but I can only ever catch a glimpse of them in the elevators before they close. They always have this weird expression of discomfort in their faces.     
     
At this point, I've mostly conformed with my condition. I spend my days reading ebooks, watching youtube videos, just accumulating as much knowledge as I can. I've always loved learning, so it's the way I've chosen to cope with the fact that I'm stuck here, away from my friends, away from my family, away from my future, my goals, my fucking dreams, just stuck here in this dreadful office where everything is the same. Even if I'm able to learn, it's not enough. It's still fucking torture. I want my life back.

Please help me out with what ECs I should do. Now another problem, I can only do all the US application stuff this year and junior year because I have to study for IIT-JEE senior year in case I don't get financial aid. I'm really confused with what to do. Any advice from international STEM students who got into a good college would be really appreciated."

68wsht,1,2017-05-02,CRA Tax Return - Losing My Tuition Credits due to Foreign Income,totallylegitseller,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/68wsht/cra_tax_return_losing_my_tuition_credits_due_to/,"Bit of a background: I've studied at a Canadian university for 3 years, and racked up over 30k in tuition amounts that I can use for tuition tax credits, since I did not have income during those years. Last year, I worked for a bit in Canada, and went for a well-paying internship in the US at a tech company. 


I filed US taxes already, and calculated a foreign tax credit for my Canadian tax return of ~ $6000. For some reason, the calculations on Schedule 11 actually used my tuition amounts for tuition credits before my foreign tax credit, and since I had such a large amount in tuition credits, my total tax credits (tuition ~30k * 0.15 + foreign 6k) is larger than my total tax owed. This means that I'd be losing tuition amounts equivalent to more than $4000 dollars. 


I called the CRA inquiry hotline, and they understood the problem, but said there was nothing they could do about it. This is really unfair, since I'm losing a significant amount of credits, and my parents can't even claim some of them since they would all be used. Is there any way for me to keep those credits for later? I should point out that my parents were the main source of the funds used to pay tuition, but they mostly went through my bank account (EAP, OSAP grants, etc), and the tuition amounts are linked to my SIN. (I paid off my OSAP loans in full with my parents' money.)"

I've always wanted to do some form of software engineering outside of college and was on my way to doing so.

I didn't look for a job in the last semester of college as I already had an offer. However the company did not honor this and I had to hastily find a job (if anyone is actually curious I can go into detail). Luckily I found a job in the support field and to be honest I don't like it.

I finally started looking for software engineering jobs in the past three months but no one will actually give me even first round/phone interviews. I always hear something like ""We are looking for more senior level individuals"" or just radio silence. I have experience with a different co-ops and internships and even was team lead for all of them. The jobs I apply are tagged as Entry Level in the job boards and searches I use so I don't think I'm outside of my experience zone here.

I had thought three years of co-op/internship experience would be enough, but maybe a support job right out of college doesn't look too good. Either way, what can I do to become more attractive to companies?"
68ww0y,3,2017-05-02,How to know where to do my co-op?,mydgnim,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68ww0y/how_to_know_where_to_do_my_coop/,"I'm a CS student at UBC and I'm just in the middle of applying for my first co-op. I'm probably in the top 5-10% of students academically, and I've done a couple hackathons and personal projects, but I don't think I'm a programming prodigy or anything -- all my projects are pretty basic. I'm just good at logical thinking. 

At UBC, we are really pressured to accept our first co-op offer. I only have time to do 1-2 co-op terms (this is my second degree and a career change for me -- I need to graduate quickly because I can't afford to be in school for a long time).

I am really nervous of ending up in a co-op that I don't learn from. The thing is, I don't really know *what* I want to do (UI? databases? networking? I have no idea!) -- I just want the co-op to have a good internship program, teach me lots of new things that I can't learn in class, and have opportunities for me to make a meaningful contribution (and look good on my resume since I'd like to aim high for a top tier internship in my 2nd work term). 

But I have no idea how to gauge which co-ops fit the bill or not from their job description, meaning I am just kind of applying blindly on our co-op site ... but the first company that wants to hire me, I am very much pressured to accept. So I really need to filter at the job description level (rather than after the interview), since after I interview, if a company extends an offer, I have to take it.

Any suggestions/red flags/things to look for in job descriptions or company websites? I don't have any professional contacts to ask. I think I am a competitive job candidate based on my grades, other work experience, and the fact that I do have some personal projects and hackathons, but then again I'm only in 3rd year (competing with 4th year students) and like I said my personal projects are relatively basic.

Alternatively, if you know of stellar companies in Vancouver, BC, for co-op students (or if you know any to avoid), please let me know :)"

(Situation and Use Cases Inside),unreal_noodle,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/68x11g/advice_needed_new_desktop_build_lightweight/,"Hello r/pccmasterrace, as stated in the title, I'm currently trying to decide the fate of my computing situation moving forward and I would love to hear your thoughts on which option I should pursue. Incoming small wall of text.

My situation: I'm currently a college student entering my (super) senior year in engineering. I'd like to upgrade from my current build as I'm using:  

* A 2011 built rig w/ i5-2500k, 8GB memory, HD6950...you get the idea.


* A Chromebook for school and portability (which isn't cutting it when I need to use Windows engineering software offline for classes/ exams, etc.)

**Computing needs**: general usage, productivity, gaming. Games I play and would like to play in the future include: FFXIV, HotS, several big titles I've missed over the years (Witcher 3, FO4, GTA V, Overwatch, etc). I'm perfectly happy playing these at 1080p and 60fps perfomance-wise.

**Other considerations**: as I'm still a college student, I'll be doing a lot of moving around day-to-day and month-to-month (class, library, out of state internships, going home for holidays, moving apartments, probably moving for a full time job within a year, etc.). I also can't spend $4000 on a Razer Blade Pro.

After much research, I've narrowed my options to the 3 situations mentioned in the post title. Of course each has their own pros/cons, but this is how I see it for my situation and use cases:

* Build a new rig (SFF) and get a cheap Windows laptop: more cost efficient for performance in the desktop department, but is the most difficult in terms of moving around the entire setup. Comes with all the joys of a desktop rig. Takes up the most space.

* Get a laptop and eGPU: from what I understand, a relatively new and growing segment that requires you to have a Thunderbolt compatible laptop with good performing internals (which are probably pricey on their own). In addition, you have to buy a GPU and eGPU housing that is confirmed to work with the laptop without issue, of which there seems to be a lot of with drivers and general compatibility. Probably least viable for me.

* Gaming laptop: seemingly not as terrible as they were 5 years ago thanks to new architectures/platforms, and you can get very close to desktop level performance with i5, i7, GTX1050ti or GTX1060 (which still blows my mind). Some gaming laptops scream ""I'm a gamer xD"", while others are quite portable and mature-looking -- which I'd prefer. A lot of variability in terms of what I could potentially buy; go all-in on something like a Gigabyte Aero 14, or get something more affordable like a Dell Inspirion 7567. By far the most portable and all-in-one option.

Given the above considerations, I'm leaning towards a gaming laptop. The pitfalls of lifespan, no upgrade-ability, future-proofing, and cost efficiency are still there, but the level of performance that you can get in a 14 or 15 inch laptop that is still portable (around 5 pounds, for me) is unique to this option. Am I making the right decision or am I crazy? Thanks again.

**TL;DR: Is a gaming laptop the best option for my situation? See: ""Computing Needs"" and ""Other considerations"".**

So, quick introduction, I am a SE major at a respectable Canadian school with only one more year until graduation and a mediocre/slightly below average GPA. I don't have much internship experience; I recently just finished a 12 month term at a BI internship (my only co-op job), and have decided to take this summer off to create projects and learn new languages to bolster my portfolio. In terms of my extracurriculars, I am a team lead as part of a FSAE team. 

Now, the questions I have: 

1. Which courses should I take in my final year? I have two electives and I want to make sure that I'm not wasting my time/money on a subject that is not going to further my development.

2. What technologies should I learn to make myself look better to the better software companies? I have done some research and so far I have found Java, C++, C, Perl and PHP are the most popular among the Big Four, but what are some others that top software companies are using?

3. What other skills should I try to develop this summer? What other resources should I look at and work at so that I can use this summer in the most efficient way?

There was a company X that had a conference to show off there products and they wanted CS and engineering students to attend.  I literally said screw it, ill just go and take a day off school.  I attended this conference and initially just wanted to network and see what it was all about.  Next thing I know from just being confident and friendly, I had two team leaders wanting me on their team for the internship.  I was given no formal interview, no algorithm questions, I just talked to them whole time about myself, what they did, my family, and my goals in my career.  I was offered both positions.  The biggest thing I got from this is just to take every opportunity available to you because you really never know who you can meet or what could happen.  Thanks again!

I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to update, things have been really crazy here. First off, I want to thank everyone who has been thinking of me and my family. We haven’t found Katie yet, but we are hoping that sharing her story will help us come up with ideas on where to find her. Or maybe it will help catch the monster who took her. 

Second, I’m sorry for my potty mouth. My wife, Karen, has yelled at me plenty of times about it. I get stressed, fucking sue me. 

Anyway, I promised you an update...I just wish I had happier news. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Katie is still missing. The Boston PD think someone has been watching Katie—and our family—for a while now. Based off of the creepy ass note we found nailed to our door, the cops think it’s been about two years that Katie has been followed. Why this creep chose now to reveal himself is beyond me. Why he left us a note addressed to Katie (or rather “*Mary*”) doesn’t make any sense to me. Maybe he is trying to mess with us? The cops think so. They actually think we may be the targets. Honestly, *none* of this makes sense to me. I never thought we would be dealing with this sort of thing. 

Karen and I met during our sophomore year of high school. Actually, the same school that Katie goes to. It’s this private school in the heart of Boston that teaches kids from kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade.  Honestly, Karen and I loved it when we went so we thought Katie would too once she made the grades to get in. We transferred her there two years ago out of the public school system. Now I kind of wish we hadn’t. 

Jesus, this is harder to talk about than I thought. 

Karen and I became a thing at the end of sophomore year. It was pretty cliché, if you think about it. I was a jock playing basketball and Karen was the head cheerleader. I know what you are thinking, cliquey, right? Honestly, maybe it was a bit. But we generally hung out with everyone. Actually, the guy to introduce me to Karen was my best friend, Stan. He was part of the “nerd” clique, if you want to call it that. But honestly it really wasn’t like that. Everyone in school just got along. And Stan and I got along really well, we always had. We grew up on the same block in Boston (Southie, if you are from around here) so we bonded over the neighborhood and always took the train in together. He was my best friend and, luckily enough, Karen’s math tutor. 

Stan introduced us after a game one night and I don’t know, we just hit it off. We spent every day attached to the hip. And when Stan got a girlfriend we doubled all the time. Movies, parties, you name it. The four of us were inseparable. So yeah, Karen and I had fun in that school—we thought Katie would too. 

My wife and I were a shit show when the cops arrived to talk to us. Around this point, it was probably like 6:00 pm or so. Usually, Karen picks up Katie at the commuter rail around 4:00 pm, right on her way home from work. But apparently Karen was late today so she headed straight home, assuming Katie would just walk the two blocks to the house. Obviously, that’s not what happened. Karen found the note a bit after 4:00 pm and we called me up in tears at work. I left immediately while Karen called the school, Katie’s friends, teachers, etc. 

Like I said before, Katie’s teachers said that she got on the train with the other kids who commuted to and from school. So something must have happened either on that train or as soon as Katie got off. For those of you who haven’t read the comments, the commuter rail here is really safe. The school actually recommends that kids take it in from the suburbs instead of busing in or carpooling. I drop Katie off each morning and my wife picks her up in the afternoon. A teacher or chaperone is always around to grab the kids off and on the train near the school. So honestly we thought it was a pretty safe system. 

Karen kept sobbing uncontrollably saying that it was all her fault our daughter was missing.  I know this makes me sound like an ass, but I agreed with her. I told her I understood and of course it wasn’t her fault but in the back of my head I just...I started to wonder. 

If she had been there to pick her up...I mean, I don’t know if that would have changed anything but we won’t *know* now, will we? And why was she late to start with? She was hardly ever late. Sorry...sorry this is stressful. I love my wife, I *really* do. It’s just lately we have been having some problems. Normal marital problems, but still. 

The cops asked us all sorts of questions when they arrived. Apparently they were already sending a patrol out to the train station to grab surveillance footage (if there was any) and to patrol the neighborhood. They asked us about our work schedules, what Katie was like, if she knew not to talk to strangers, if we had any enemies or anyone who would want to hurt her or us, etc. Karen works for a law firm that primarily deals with nonprofits so she didn’t think this was in any way connected to her job. And me? I mean, I’m a normal guy. I don’t have any enemies. Maybe I’ve cut someone off in a Starbucks line or something but like, who hasn’t done that? And I’ve fallen out of touch with a few friends over the years but that’s just life. We get busy. We have kids, we lose touch. 

Oh, poor Katie. Damn, this is so surreal. 

It was like we were thrust into the middle of a goddamn movie. They even took the note in for fingerprint analysis. They told us that if it was a local pedophile, they would have their prints in the system. My wife started sobbing at that mention and we had to wait ten minutes for her to calm down until we could proceed. 

After hours of questioning an officer came into our house with some news. He was a gruff looking guy but he had a certain level of sadness in his eyes when he approached us. He took off his hat and shook our hands, adverting our eyes. Whatever he had to say, it wasn’t good news. 

“We uh, we found something,” the cop blurted out. 

My wife grabbed my arm, her knuckles turning white. 

“We tracked the 3:20 train she was on all the way to its last stop. We grabbed the footage from today, which we are analyzing now back in the station, and searched each car one by one,” he paused, briefly glancing at his commanding officer as if he was expecting praise. The commanding officer nodded slightly. 

He coughed into his hand before continuing. “We, um, we identified her backpack.” 

My wife sat down, staring straight ahead. 

“It’s the uh, the—“

“The pink one,” Karen whispered. “The one I got for her for Christmas.”

The officer nodded. “We brought it back to the station to look for anything but first we needed you to see this.” The officer pulled out a white note delicately pressed in a plastic evidence bag. He handed it to me. 

“Think you can make sense of this?”

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Oh Mary, 

Mary, Mary, Mary. Your parents must be so sick and worried by now. I would love to see THEIR faces. I would love to watch HIM suffer for once.   

HE must be blaming HER. Because we know HE hates to take any blame for himself. And really, after all, it was HER fault, wasn’t it? 

If SHE wasn’t fucking HER intern, then you would be safe, wouldn’t you? Oh but, Mary, you are much more safe with me. I can take care of you. I can love you like THEY never could. I don’t need anyone else but you, Mary. SHE needs an intern to fuck HER brains out. SHE’S needed him for a whole year, Mary. But me? I don’t need anyone but you. 

All I’ve ever wanted was to comb your hair and wrap my arms around you. Wouldn’t you like that, Mary? Wouldn’t you enjoy spending time with someone who adores you? I adore you, Mary. I’ve always adored you. 

I’m sure you will adore me too. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I handed the letter wordlessly to my wife. Her eyes scanned the page and her mouth formed a silent “O.”

“I’m so sorry,” the police officer stuttered. “But, we need to know if there is any validity to these statements.” 

We all stared at my wife. My wife of 20 years, 20 *goddamn* years. The wife I’ve loved and only loved since I was a 15-year-old kid. After a few minutes of silence, she nodded. 

The officer took the note back and brought out his notepad. “We have a few questions for you, Karen.”

That went on for a while. They asked her how long she had been having the affair, what his name was, if he had any reason to hurt us, etc. My ears buzzed the entire time. I felt nauseous and had to walk out of the room a few times to gain my composure. Not only was my daughter, my Katie, missing, but my wife was fucking an *intern* behind my back. For a year. A whole year. And I had no idea. 

All of those times she said she was working late she was actually screwing Tom Villa—a baby-faced 23-year-old law student. We’ve had him over for dinner, for fucks sake. I shook his hand, I introduced him to Katie. He even brought her a toy to play with. 

But apparently Tom was screwing my lovely wife this afternoon at 3:50 pm, making her late to pick up our daughter. Yeah, yeah there was proof. Photos on my wife’s phone. Perfect, right? Just *perfect*. An officer went off to interview Tom anyway, just in case. He confirmed Karen’s story. 

For a second I really hoped it had been the intern. Then we would have been close to finding Katie at least. 

By the time they were done asking questions it was pretty late at night. The officers were still reviewing the day’s footage and they already had an amber alert out for Katie. They said the best thing we could do was to stay put, try to get some sleep and go down to the station the first thing in the morning. Yeah, like we could actually sleep after today. 

As soon as Karen closed the door on the officers, she poured herself a glass of wine. She winced when she looked up at me and poured me one too. I took it from her with shaky hands. 

“I’m sorry,” she murmured, staring into her untouched glass. 

“An *intern*, really?” The words tasted bitter in my mouth. 

“I know, I know,” she shook her head. “I’m, I just can’t explain it. It’s not a relationship, it was just—“ 

“Don’t. Don’t you dare say it was just sex,” I spat. “We have more important things to focus on right now. I don’t need to hear about you spreading your legs for Tom *fucking* Villa.”

Karen was silent, her face turning a beet red. “You’re right. We have Katie to think about now.” She took a gulp of her wine. “Do you, do you think she’s ok?” 

“I don’t know.” Those words hung in the air for a while. We drank in silence, refusing to look at each other. 

At some point, and I’m not sure how, we ended up falling asleep on the couch in the living room. Her head was bent towards the phone and my hands remained curled around my cell, waiting to pick up just in case we got a call. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our landline rung loudly, jolting me awake from a hazy dream about Katie. She had been crying silently, waving at me from a train window. A dark figure had his hand on her shoulder, his fingers clawing into her collarbone. 

Karen was the first to the phone. She picked it up on the second ring with a breathy, “Katie?”

I peeled myself away from the couch and joined her at the phone. It was 5:23 in the morning. Katie would have still been asleep in her bed. 

“Yes, yes,” Karen nodded eagerly. “Of course, we will be right there.”

She hung up and turned to me, her lips pulled in a thin line. “They reviewed the footage and think they found something. They want us to come down to the station.”

My heart felt tight and hot in my chest. I followed Karen out the door, still wearing what I had the day before. As soon as we got to the station we were ushered into a small, bare viewing room with about four other officers. They stared at us, their faces unreadable. There was a small TV set up in the center of the room. A table and two chairs sat facing the TV monitor.  I had a sinking feeling in my chest. Even though I was pissed at Karen, I reached for her hand. Our daughter was missing. Whatever we were dealing with, whatever this was, we needed each other. 

“We finished collecting and reviewing the footage from the 3:20 pm train and the MBTA station stops along the entire route of the commuter rail,” the commanding officer from the day before explained. “You, you uh better sit down.”

We nearly fell into the seats pulled out for us. The officer pressed play on the TV and we were greeted with four, small squares that showed the interior and exterior of the train. The officer began to fast-forward. 

“Here you can see Katie entering the 3:20 train,” he explained. And sure enough, there she was. She walked onto the train with her head down, briefly pausing to wave to her teacher before she stepped through the door. The officer pressed fast-forward again. “We see here that she is in carriage four, right near the back of the train.” Once again, we were greeted with Katie’s image. She was a grainy figure sitting by the window, her head leaning up against the glass. My heart ached violently. 

The officer took a breath. “We uh, we have reason to believe that this man is the one who took your daughter,” he explained, pointing to the screen. The man was sitting across from Katie, his head bent low. “It appears that he takes the same train each day in the morning and afternoon. He arrives on one stop after your daughter in the morning and he is already on the train by the time she enters in the afternoon. So this leads us to believe that he works in the city and commutes near your suburb. This narrows our search significantly.”

I felt my wife squeeze my hand, her face looked panicked and taunt. 

“Now uh, this part will be hard to watch,” The officer says. The other cops in the room turned their eyes intently towards the screen. 

The man approached Katie. Even in the grainy footage, you could tell he was smiling. He handed her a teddy bear and my wife and I exchanged looks. We’ve been through the “Stranger” conversation before. Katie knew not to talk to strangers. She knew that bad guys existed. She knew never, ever to accept anything from anyone that wasn’t her mom and dad. We’ve practiced this, we’ve been through this. But here she was, reaching out her slender arm to grab the teddy bear the man was offering her. My wife started to cry. 

The footage after that showed the man sitting with Katie, talking to her as she played with the bear. Katie could be seen grinning, talking back to the strange man. When the train pulled up to the stop before hers, the man reached for Katie’s hand and she took it. He leaned down to whisper something in her ear and Katie shrugged off her backpack, handing it to the man. He appeared to tape the note to it as he left it by the window, in plain site. This must have been the note the cops found yesterday. The pair then left together, hand in hand. 

Footage from the station showed the pair exiting the platform as Katie skipped with the new toy. Before leaving the frame, the man glanced up at the camera and smiled, as if he had known we were watching the whole time. I shivered. 

“Do you recognize this man?” I grabbed my wife’s hand roughly under the table. 

“No,” I said. “We don’t.” 

I had a sinking feeling in my chest. He had looked so familiar...but I just couldn’t place the face. I needed time to think. After another round of questioning we were let go. We drove home in silence. As soon as we got back Karen went up to Katie’s room, silently sobbing. I went to the den, my head rattling with jumbled thoughts. 

I headed straight to the bookcase where our old high school yearbooks were, my heart growing heavier by the second. I furiously flipped through the pages until I found the senior portraits. My fingers shook as I found the portrait I wanted. A small, white note fell out between the pages as if it had been left as a bookmark. 

I stared at the portrait. A dark-haired boy with wire-rimmed glasses smirked up at me—Stan, my high school best friend. 

I reached for the note. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Oh Mary,

Do you think HE knows who I am now? Well, HE must know who I am. But, does HE remember? Does HE remember what HE did to me? To us? 

Oh Mary, my beautiful Mary. Your father never appreciated you. HE didn’t know what HE had until it was gone. It’s a familiar feeling, one that I have lived with every day of my life. 

Does your father know how much of a monster HE is? Does HE really think I can leave a pretty, delicate little bird like you with such a horrible person? I don’t want HIM to hurt you, Mary. I don’t want HIM to hurt you like HE hurt me. 

No, no I’m sure HE doesn’t remember. Not yet, anyway. 

But soon, Mary. Soon.

I'm doing a conversion masters in comp sci, and my dream is to work about 9-12 months, live frugally, and then travel / do whatever I want for a few months, then repeat. 

So I figure temp contracts are the way forward, but reckon it's probably wise to get some experience in the permanent role for a year or two first for some on-the-job learning. 

Is there any consensus on the best type of employer to look for given my goal? Would a big-name employer be better (brand recognition) or small business (breath of knowledge)? Maybe a software dev agency (range of projects)?

I currently code mostly in python and java, and am considering doing an AWS cert or 2. Other than the usual projects / internships etc, is there anything I can to to increase my employability specifically for short - term positions?

My best class is in algorithms but that applies to every part of computer science. However, I know I want to work in social media and I have only interned for such companies.

On my first internship in a big media company, I got randomly assigned to a video team. Now in another media company, I got assigned to a video team (I guess based on my first internship experience). 

My favorite courses are in algorithms, theory of social networks, information retrieval, machine learning and computer vision in that order. 

I know machine learning can be applied to optimizing video delivery and computer vision can be applied to recognizing and classifying aspect of videos and so can algorithms. But I'm clearly missing out on info retrieval and the theory of social networks which I would love to explore too.

Is there a future in video? Or should I move on to a different aspect of social media that better explores my interest? I really don't have anything specific in mind. I know with the advent of live streaming, 360 videos, VR and AR it's becoming popular. But it seems video is not as buzzing as I would like it to be.

Over the past year, I've developed a strong interest for Finance, specifically trading. Summer 2018 will be my last internship and I'm just wondering what should I start doing now to ensure I get the job? 

A little about me:

* Two internships have been done at big banks as an Analyst, within Wealth Mgmt, but not Capital Mkts. More technology based roles.

* Third internship will be (hopefully) done at a big software dev company as a developer. 

* I've started learning a lot about finance, and will continue to do so. As well as apply my knowledge to trading strategies

* I'm trying to incorporate my programming skills with trading

* I go to a non-target biz school, studying biz + tech, but it's not something of concern. GPA is good.


What should I start doing today to make sure I get a role within Capital Markets? Thanks.

I've received two interviews, got rejected by one, and still waiting on the other, although it has been two months since that said interview. I also applied for a mentor position at my school in which I was also rejected from, putting an even bigger gap in my summer plans.

My GPA is a 3.2, although my major GPA is a 3.45. I have both listed on my resume.

I am looking to pursue a data analyst career out of college (data scientist being the long term goal) but am worried about potentially not receiving a junior internship because of the fact that I did not gain professional experience as a rising junior.

I have plans to finish learning Python and do some side projects on github this summer, but do not have a part time job lined up either (was banking on a paid internship)

TLDR; No sophomore summer internship as an Econ major; how bad of a position am I right now?"

We can call the C and E.  

C pledged last semester and we grew to be really good friends.  He knew I was moving out of the fraternity house and wanted to move out of the dorms.  He told me his friend E wanted to move in also.  It ended up working out and we got a place near campus.  Everyone payed their deposit, and we were under way.  E had one month where we kinda had a problem, but has payed everything when I asked him to.

We are all on the utilities and the lease.  Everything was good until 2 months ago. C hasn't payed and when I asked him about it, he said he only had $20 dollars till next week.  I had money and wasn't trying to make him not eat.  I said that was fine. Next week comes around and I just don't see him.  Week after I ask if he can pay that week, he said yes, and just no show.  

I realized what is happening and finally he said that when he gets a dining dollar refund he will get me part of what he owes me ($220) but his refund is only $150, and next utilities will be up for payment.  This isn't the first time I have had to cover for him.  Twice, I have had to pay his part of rent ($400) and wait for him to get me back.  Its always been within 2 days, but I just can't afford anymore, even though I work 25-30 hours at a great paying (most I have ever made at a job) internship.  

I was not extremely mad until I found out he is going to New Orleans with the rest of the fraternity for formal next week.  Just to go it is $200 dollars and he just found a date, which means he just paid.  He will end up paying much more for drinks, food, and just going places in New Orleans.  

What do I do? I can't move out, no one wants my lease, and my lease isn't up until August 1 . Do I let the utilities cut off? Do I keep paying to avoid the hit to my credit? How do I confront this?  I am out money and he gets to go out and I can't afford to enjoy my time this semester.  

TLDR: I have had to cover for my roommate for a few months because he told me he was getting paid in the next week.  It's now 2 months later and owes me ($220) and has payed his and his dates way to New Orleans for formal.  I don't know how to best approach the situation. "

695ket,3,2017-05-04,[ADVICE] Dev Intern Gig Or Open Source Work + FreeCodeCamp?,thezac2613,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/695ket/advice_dev_intern_gig_or_open_source_work/,"Hello. I am in an interesting situation and I could use some career advice. 

I am currently employed as a part-time QA Engineer at a small-mid size (~50 employees) company, where I earn a mere $13/hr in a high COL area. I attend university online and I am about 50% through my degree in Software Development. My parents support me financially 100%.

A few weeks ago, I approached the head of the development department at my job and asked him about the possibility of joining development. His response was:

 &gt;""We'll see. We won't be able to do that for at least 8ish months, but maybe after that."" I was pretty underwhelmed with this response, so I began looking at other opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

After discussing with my family, it was decided that I would quit my job and spend my time working on school, freecodecamp, and open source projects. I felt that this change would be a better use of my time (I wouldn't have to wait 8+ months) and allow me to obtain my goal, become a developer, more quickly.

 So here is where it gets interesting. Two days ago, I gave my boss (head of QA) my two-weeks-notice and I explained to him that I will be reallocating my time so that I can grow as a developer. Earlier today, the head of the dev department called me into his office and said: 

&gt; ""I'm sorry to hear that you gave your two-weeks notice. I think it is really a shame for the company to lose someone with your intelligence and passion. So, I have pulled some strings and we can *now* bring you in as a Software Dev Intern, at your same hourly rate, if you go full time."" 

**Another note, that is worth adding:** 
This same head of the dev department has previously promised another coworker that they could move into the dev department. This was about a 2-months ago and the coworker is still not in development. Personally, I think he got swindled and this is a serious concern of mine.

**Here are my questions:**

1) I am leaning towards saying no to the dev internship and continuing with my earlier plan (school, freecodecamp, and open source work). Does this seem like a bad career move, given the fact that my utimate goal is to become a Software Developer? 

2) If I was to say yes to the intern opportunity, do you think I should ask for a raise to match the going rate for dev interns in my area, or is that pushing the limit?

3) Do you have any other advice for me, or is there something else that I am not considering, that I should?

I graduated over 4 years ago from a mediocre public Uni with a B.S. in C.S.; During my time there I interned at a small local company and afterwards I have worked for a Fortune 100 company for two years as a SDE in a low CoL area (not Cali/NYC). During my time there I was promoted once and was on track to being promoted again due to good performance, however this was definitely not a 'Big4' company. Upon my departure two years ago my total comp was just north of $100k, and I feel like I was doing well and being 'groomed' for management (which is what I desired).

Since then, I have joined the USAF under a pilot contract. I have successfully, and without issue, completed all initial phases of training (OTS, introductory flight training, I do have hours in my logbook etc.) but have been found medically disqualified at my annual flight physical. After consulting with several doctors and my superiors, my options will likely be to separate from the USAF or to stay in in another capacity (depending on community needs, etc.).

To be frank, I have enjoyed flying for the USAF immensely, but if it were not for that benefit I would much rather return to my previous career. I have almost 0 coding experience over the past 2 years, but I will have some free time in the coming months to (re)learn the information. If I were to return to a career in development, how likely would I be able to return where I left off? Would I have to start looking for low paid internships to start? How can I explain away this two year hiatus? I have spoken to my family about this and they are urging me to stay with whatever the AF offers me and hopefully make a career of it as they think that I will return home only to struggle from here on out.

There is this idea that your starting salary out of school determines your lifetime earnings, and since I have now been working for much lower pay would I be looking at similar numbers upon my return (While the military does compensate it's officers well, it is ~half of my previous earnings).

Any insight or advice appreciated from the more experienced members about my conundrum and what options I truly have. I must say, the doom and gloom on this subreddit can be depressing."

All the while, I was super successful in internships, was a leader in several organizations, and I had the image that everything was fine. 

My turning point was when my GPA was a 2.1 after excluding two failing grades. I was asked to step down from the extra-curriculars that I was really involved in to focus on classwork.  I had to face people I had lied to for months and come clean.

Now, 5 semesters later, I have brought my GPA up to nearly a 3.0, my group received the highest presentation grade of any group for Senior Design (7 teams, 3 presentations per team throughout the semester), and I was asked to be the student speaker at my department's graduation ceremony.  I have an awesome job making 72k that I will begin this July, after I go to China for two weeks with some classmates.

I am about to start my last, senior, year of Chemical Engineering, and I have come to realize that Chemical Engineering is not what I want to do in my life. During the junior year, I was in search of internships and trying to learn as much as I can about the industry. I attended many lectures given by people with years of professional experience in Chemical Engineering, listened to their success stories, their struggles and overall experience. Also, I went for a field trip to a local company's facility located one and half hour away from the city. By the end of the Spring Semester, a thought of whether I made a right choice for my major started coming to my mind quite often. I cannot imagine myself working as a Chemical Engineer all my life. Spending days away from my family, dedicating my life to work. I want a different lifestyle. Of course, if I actually enjoyed this type of work, I would not mind, however, I don't. I enjoyed chemistry and math when I was in highschool, but Chemical Engineering occurred to be something completely different than I imagined. 
This year, I started learning Python out of curiosity, and it got me hooked. In addition, I took a course in MatLab, which was a requirement for my major, and I could easily spend my Friday and Saturday working on assignments, trying to make them as neatly as I can. I enjoyed it. I think I am going to get Master's in Computer Science, so I could get a job in it later. Right now, I have 1 year of Python behind me with some basic knowledge of HTML, XML, JSON, SQLite; MatLab. I am planning on learning C++ and Java just to get a more well-rounded skillset, as I have noticed that these two languages are quite common in job requirements, then I will dedicate my time to specialize in a couple of them. I am thinking about picking a minor, but it's unlikely because I have only a year left in my major, even if I stay in college to take summer courses. 
What do you think of my idea? Any useful advices would be appreciated. Thank you.
P.S. I know that I will be behind students who actually majored in Computer Science. However, I am ready to learn and dedicate my time to transition to Computer Science. For me, it's a small trade-off, when I think about doing something that I would enjoy."

I recently got a Summer Internship offer for the position of Graphic Designer / Front End Web Developer with a company that works doing digital advertising and PR Marketing, I was offered the job on Friday the 28th and accepted it on Monday the 1st. However, recently I was contacted by a recruiter who had e-mailed me about a full time Graphic Designer position with ESPN a couple of weeks prior to applying for the internship that the sports company wants to arrange a phone interview with me. Its a bottom of the barrel graphic design job, doing basic presentation layouts, file prep and management, some concept development and other graphic design tasks. But from what a friend of mine has told me who has worked for Disney before said is that they hire internally which would give me strong opportunities for growth.

Now I am not sure what to do in the event that I do well on the series of interviews, phone, video and in person and am offered the job. Do I tell the internship the situation if I am offered the job? Inform them before hand if the phone interview goes well and I am asked to continue with the interview process? Or should I with the internship and if I am offered the job to say I will accept it after the internship is over?

Let me begin by saying that I really enjoy this sub, having finally ditched my PS4 after buying myself a nice little gaming laptop about a month ago. I always played Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Skyrim on my old desktop PC that I purchased in 2009, but this new laptop of mine is the first piece of kit I bought specifically for PC gaming on the go (Intel i7 7700HQ, 16 GB DDRIV RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, GTX 960M).

Anyway, the UK Editor of PC Gamer (Samuel Roberts) has agreed to do an interview with me for publication on my website. I'm not going to promote my website here in case I break some rules. Instead, I promise you I will post a copy of the interview here on r/pcmasterrace when it is finished (probably in a week or two).

I will say that my website centres around media jobs and career advice/development – journalism, publishing, television production etc. So I will be asking Samuel questions of this nature. 

So, if you want to know how to get into video game journalism, or PC gaming journalism specifically, I am open to any questions you might have for Samuel that may build upon my standard set of template questions. Usually, I ask things such as:

* When did you first realise that you wanted to make a living from [video game journalism] and what were the very first steps you took to achieve this? What, if anything, did you do to make the most of your student years?

* You personally interview and hire the interns who work at PC Gamer. What makes a potential new entrant stand out from the crowd during the application process?

And so on. I usually ask these people no more than six questions as they are pretty swamped with their actual jobs. I have my typical questions drafted up, but if you're someone who perhaps wants to work in PC journalism and you'd like to help make this Q&amp;A as good as it can be then I would appreciate your input.

Some background story,
I am an international student studying Software Engineering in one of the best universities in the USA. While I was searching for internships, coincidently, I got two internship offers on the same day.
One offer was from major giant in networking let's call it `A` and other was giant in B2B Software, let's call it `B`.

Since I got both offers on the same day, and I had to return back by next day, I accepted both offers thinking I would renege one offer at later point of time.

Now comes the part where I actually had to join the company in a month, i mailed the HR of `A` that I will not be able to join the company. The HR got really pissed off. She called the career center of my university and the department of my university that I reneged the offer.

1. Now I'm banned from being hired at `A` forever.
2. I'm banned from participating any of the career center services.
3. The department of my university is not ready to give work authorization for the company `B` because I brought shame to the university by not honoring the internship offer.

This is gonna cost me around $25K for the internship offer that I had for three months.


TL;DR 
I had accepted two job offers, rejected one, leading to being banned from that company forever and losing my other offer because the HR of first company was pissed off.

One is for a software engineering firm on the north side of Atlanta, where they're offering $65,000, and the other is a manufacturing plant that I've been interning at, and they're offering $70,000. The benefits are pretty much the same, with the exception that the manufacturing plant does annual profit sharing that could push it 4-5k higher than it is. 

The company I've been at for a year as an intern is a manufacturing company with a fairly small IT department. I build apps for production and defect tracking, and manage their database. They only have 1 full time developer after the previous one left, and I've been sort of filling in the space he left. My boss really wants to keep me, since I've developed some useful apps over the past year that have helped track defects and part data. 

The company in Atlanta is a small firm with ~60 clients, ranging from medical to manufacturing, and they deal with a bunch of different technologies and languages. They have a startup vibe since they're small, but they've been around for a little over a decade. I have 2 close friends who work there, one of which put in the word that got me interviewed and an offer, and the other just accepted an offer. 

Both places primarily use C# and build web applications, with the software firm dabbling in a bunch of other frameworks and languages depending on the client. 

I feel like the software firm would get me more experience that I could user later in my career, but I'd wager that the difficulty and work load will be a fair bit higher than where I'm currently at.  The place I'm at now is pretty laid back with a low/moderate work load, but I don't feel like I've learned a whole lot in the last year since I've been there besides the code base. 

The cost of living is a fair bit higher near the software firm, but the north side of Atlanta is a nice place to live depending on the area. The manufacturing plant is pretty much in bumfuck nowhere.

I need help on deciding which masters to do and would like more information before i make the decision.

Currently I have been offered MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at LSE and MPHIL Economics at Cambridge.

Ideally, I would like to become a quant researcher who uses econometric models to create pricing models. I also like the mathematical side of finance so a role in that field is what I am looking at (also maybe IB to get me into a hedge fund in the first place).

I also do not feel like spending 4 more years on PHD.

Currently these are my thoughts ( could someone help me correct this if my thinking is flawed)

1) The LSE course is more quantitative and has a much deeper focus on econometrics. The course is much harder and gives me a higher chance to become a quant researcher but it is more geared towards being a pathway for PHD candidates. 

2) However, it is tough for me to be a quant without a PHD and I would have to compete against people with a lot more internships and experience than me ( I only have 1 internship at a small fund doing long equities). Therefore, It is very risky to go to the LSE course because I dont think many people outside of academia can tell the difference between EME and regular economics at LSE.

3) Cambridge is more prestigious overall even though the specific course at LSE is safer and would give me a better shot at IBD and other roles in finance and I can work my way to being a quant from there. 

4) Cambridge course is better since I can more easily get a distinction for that course compared to the LSE EME which gives like 2 distinctions across 20-30 students (with a high dropout rate)

So currently I am leaning towards cambrdige even though I like the LSE course more. As this is a really important decision, any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you"

The email they sent referred to a position I didn't apply to, but I assume they're just considering me for a position they think I would better fit.

I've done one phone interview before, and it was with the lead audio engineer at a car company in California, for an internship possibility (no public listing or opening). Seeing as how I have no hands-on work experience in that field yet - hence why I'm seeking internships - I feel that interview didn't go very well because I had trouble answering technical questions. If at all possible, I would like to avoid that this time around.

**TL;DR phone interview for a technical internship, want to make sure I don't come across as a babbling know-nothing. What are some ""best practices"" to portray my qualifications most effectively, especially when it's not in person? And what are some general things to keep in mind and/or dos and don'ts? Thanks!**"

In the elevator, I noticed she was a SWE at the company I was looking from her ID. I expressed that I was a 2nd year computer engineering student and that I am currently looking for internships. There were no students at this event so I didn't have to fight my way into convincing anyone, also this event was filled with professionals and experts and I only got in because of a current project that I have been working on. 

She emailed me when we could have lunch sometime in the city to discuss internships. I don't want to dox myself but I have no internship experience in SWE but I do have a lot of other CS-related experience that got me in the news and two major long term projects, one that's international with a former Silicon Valley CEO and I'm currently the project manager that a Big 4 sponsored. 

**TLDR**

I'm really nervous because I don't want to mess this up. How do I go about lunch with her? 

The only advice I picked up is that you're not suppose to order things with sauce and can be picked up with a fork easily. How long should our conversation go? What should be my goal at the end of our lunch? Should I be pushy about the internship?

The company is medium sized, it pays well, and I will have the opportunity to work on highly visible stuff in the main software the company produces, which is used by companies like Walmart and Best Buy. 

If I go to this other school, I will lose the internship, because it runs during the summer and through the school year for as long as I want, meaning I need to be there during the school year.

I'm a 22 year old student who recently applied to a global event marketing company for an internship. My resume was fantastic with 3 previous good work experiences. But I just had my phone interview with one of managers, and it didn't go well. I answered the questions decently at best but I unconsciously made the interview so awkward. (I'd rate about a 6, on a scale to 10).


How much do employers care that a phone interview was awkward or uncomfortable? The manager was a young woman (~30 years old), one of those uptight, bitchy (not sure if I'd be able to work well with her). She did her best to make it go well, and I appreciate that, but right off the bat, when she called I could tell this was going to be hard for me.


I'm a little socially anxious, I answered the questions with enthusiasm, but I fumbled and stuttered, not sure I made sense half the time. Again, I had good work experience.


Please help with advice, is this something employers don't want to bring to their work environment, or can a bad phone interview be overlooked? They only do 1 interview (which is phone) and it's either you receive the internship or not.


Should I send a physical thank you card, or will a thank you email be fine? If so, how should I follow up?


Thank you!

69hv8t,210,2017-05-05,An Open Letter to the Woman in the Blue Skirt (Part Three),kmcooney,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69hv8t/an_open_letter_to_the_woman_in_the_blue_skirt/,"Part One: https://redd.it/68tuhn 
Part Two: https://redd.it/691gl5

I gripped the letter in sweaty, twitching hands. Stan had been in my house. He had been through my things. He knew I would recognize him. That sick. Fucking. Bastard. 

I felt myself slink down to the floor, my legs going numb. Stan and I never really had a falling out like some commenters thought. There wasn’t some dramatic fight or yelling or anything like that. We just stopped being friends. I mean, you know how high school is? After you graduate it gets really hard to stay in touch with people. Sure we texted every now and then but I had gone away to college and he stayed behind in Boston. He was pretty wrapped up with his girlfriend, Lily (I think? I’m not sure, it’s been so long), and obviously I was still with Karen so it was just hard to ever really meet up. 

The last time I can ever actually remember hanging out with Stan was at this kid Keith’s graduation party. I’m pretty sure the whole class showed up. I went with Stan and Lily because Karen was out of town. The party is a bit hazy to me but I don’t remember there ever being a fight or blow up. I just remember pounding music and lots of shots, Lily twirling in a blue dress. 

And now he has Katie. That sick *bastard* has Katie. 

I stumbled up and grabbed my phone, already dialing the number of the commanding officer. If Stan knew I would recognize him, then he must be pretty confident that I wouldn’t find him. This realization nearly made me throw up. 

I told the officer everything I knew about Stan and why I suspected him. He told me he would find his last known address and that Karen and I should stay put while they send out an officer to examine the note and check our house. Obviously, Stan knew how to get in since there were no signs of a break in. Jesus, the note could have been there for *months*. 

Karen’s face was puffy from crying and the news about Stan only sent her into another fresh wave of tears. I wanted to comfort her, I swear I did. But a petty part of me stood back, letting her suffer on her own. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

“Come on man, just one more!” Stan was slurring his words, Lily hung off his shoulder, giggling. 

Keith’s party was dark and loud. His parents weren’t around and we were taking full advantage of that fact. Kegs and cups littered the floor. Dancing, half-naked bodies swirled around each other in the backyard, flowing seamlessly into the pool and hot tub. My head was already pounding when I grabbed the shot out of Stan’s fist and threw it into the back of my throat. 

“Fuck YEAH, Mike! Fuck YEAH!” He screamed, getting jeers and whistles from various crowd members. I smiled, letting the warmness rush over me as hands clapped my back. 

We were all aware that this was the last hurrah. Graduation was tomorrow: half of our class was leaving for colleges out of state and the other half were staying around Boston. This was it. This was the end.

“Miiiiiike,” Lily whined, “Tell Stan he needs to dance with me!” She played with his collared shirt, tugging at it gently. Stan’s face went bright red. He wasn’t a fan of dancing; actually, “not a fan” is too light of a term. Stan *despised* dancing. He hated it with every fiber of his being. 

“Babyy come on,” Lily begged, pulling his hand to the dance floor. I’m not sure how long they had been dating, but it wasn’t as long as me and Karen. Actually, I’m not even sure if they’d slept together yet. Every time I tried to ask Stan he just got flustered and stuttered something about respecting her. 

“Fine,” Lily smirked. “I’ll dance with Mike instead.” 

She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the throng of dancers. I gave Stan a wave and a wink, laughing as Lily twirled and twirled and twirled. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the police arrived Karen and I nearly tackled them out of desperation. We wanted anything, any new information at all about Katie. Instead we were met with more questions. Did we have a security system? Had we been away at all? When was the last time I spoke to Stan?  I answered as best as I could, interrupting every now and then to ask if they had found Katie yet—they hadn’t. 

They went over the house looking for fingerprints, points of access, etc. It appears that Stan probably had been following us for a while. Likely, ever since we enrolled Katie in the school. He appeared to know our schedule, where we kept the spare key, even Karen’s uh, other activities. 

Right now, they were currently searching Stan’s last known residence. It was a little cottage on Cape Cod about an hour or so away. It had to be somewhere where no one would question him with a little girl. 

Fuck, I don’t understand why this is happening. My memory is so blurry from that party. I know I passed out in my car and left the next morning when I was sober enough to drive. I just remember throwing up in the middle of the graduation ceremony to rapturous applause from the crowd. 

The next few hours were torturous. They had us come down to the station to wait for news, just in case. We sat in torturous silence. My wife bit her nails down to the nub, fresh blood staining her fingertips. 

“Mr. And Mrs. O’Connor?” An officer poked his head out of his office. 

We bolted upright, knocking into one another as we were ushered through the officer’s door. 

“Did you find Katie?” My wife was breathless as she confronted the officer. He shook his head, sitting down behind his desk. 

“We searched the entire residence but we don’t have any reason to believe that your daughter was kept there for any length of time. We are now searching more into his background to see if we can find anything that points us to his guilt.”

“Why the FUCK is it taking so long?” I screamed. I was at my breaking point. These last few days had chiseled my patience down to a nub, lodged painful and hot in my spine. At any second, I knew I was going to burst. 

Karen looked wildly back at the officer. “You need to find my daughter. You need to do your goddamn *job*!” I had never heard her curse before and, just for a second, I couldn’t help but to appreciate that she was here with me. I took her hand in mine as we squared against the officer. 

“You need to give us answers,” I spat. 

The officer nodded calmly, smiling gently up at us. “I know you are upset—“ 

“You don’t *know* how we feel,” Karen hissed. “Don’t *pretend* you know what we are going through. You don’t have your fucking *daughter* missing.” 

Pride and rage surged in my chest as the officer hung his head. “No, I don’t know what you are going through,” He admitted. “But let me assure you that we are doing everything in our power to make sure your daughter returns safely to you. You have my word.”

We both deflated visibly, our shoulders slumping down. I hadn’t realized how exhausted I had been. 

“We did find something at the house,” the officer said steadily. “But it doesn’t lead us to where your daughter is.” 

I nodded, “It’s another note.” 

“I had the field officers fax it over,” He explained as he handed us a sheet of paper.
“We uh, we don’t really know what to make of this one,” the officer admitted. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Oh Mary,

Is HE finally starting to remember what HE did to HER? Oh Mary, I’m so so sorry you have HIM for a father. You would be much happier with me, Mary. I know how to take care of you. I know what makes you happy. 

I never would have enrolled you in that dreadful school, darling. No, no, I know how delicate you are, how fragile your skin is. I would have made sure that no one could have pierced you, Mary. I never would have hurt you like HE hurt HER. 

Does HE remember yet? Does HE know what HE did? 

HE has to remember, Mary. Because I am taking you to where it all began. I’m taking you to the end, Mary. And if HE doesn’t remember what HE did, you will be the one to suffer, darling. 

Oh Mary, I don’t want to hurt you. I really don’t want to wring your neck and spread your legs. But I will, Mary. I will. 

Tick Tock, Mary. Tick Tock. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My throat felt tight and swollen. 

“Mike?” Karen looked at me with accusation in her eyes. “What did you do to Stan? What did you do?!”

“Nothing. I didn’t do a *damn* thing,” I spat. 

“Really?” Karen turned on me, her fingers still stained with dried blood. “You must have done something!” 

I laughed then, the anger and fear of the last two days spilling out in a shrill, insane sounding laugh. “You want to talk about *honesty*, Karen? *Really*?”

Her lips pulled taunt and thin. 

The officer coughed into his hand, trying to break up the tension. “So this doesn’t mean anything to you?”

I shook my head. “It means nothing.”
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The music pounded in my ears and Lily’s hips grinded between my hands. She laughed as she leaned in close to my neck. “We should probably stop dancing now,” she whispered. “Before we make a mistake.” 

I grabbed her ass, pulling her closer. Her blue dress rode up under my touch, revealing smooth, milky skin. I groaned and pressed myself against her. “Mike come on, “ Lily hissed. “That’s enough.” She backed away, tears beading in her eyes. 

“No one has to know,” I slurred as I grabbed her waist. 

“Fuck you.”

She turned and slipped through the crowd, disappearing between rosebushes. Panic flared in my chest. Shit. Shit she was going to tell Stan. 

“Lily!” I screamed as I followed her through the bush. I looked over my shoulder for Stan but couldn’t find him. Shit. I didn’t want him to think I was coming on to her. I was with Karen, I loved Karen. We were just playing, I swear we were just playing. 

I saw Lily stagger towards Keith’s shed, heading away from the party as she struggled to pull out her phone from her purse. Fuck, fuckfuckfuck. 

I sprinted after her and grabbed her purse away, chucking it into the woods. 

“What the *hell*, Mike?!” Her eyes were wild, her auburn hair falling onto her bare shoulders. For a brief second, I wondered why Stan hadn’t fucked her yet. I wondered what her skin would feel like on mine, what her lips would taste like when I bit down. 

“Let’s talk,” I pleaded. “Please.” 

Lily hesitated for a second, looking back towards the party. We could hear the music echoing between the trees. 

“Ok,” she agreed. “But just for a minute.”

“A minute is all I need.”  

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We left the police station and drove straight back to the house. My hands were white and tense on the wheel. Karen looked straight ahead, playing with the radio. 

Flashes of the party kept coming back to me. Dancing with Lily, her hair flowing out behind her, her laugh kissing my cheek. Stan. Where was Stan? Where had he been? I violently hit my hand against my head, causing Karen to shriek out. 

“What is *wrong* with you?”

“My fucking *daughter* is missing, that’s what’s wrong.” 

“My daughter is missing too, Mike. This isn’t easy for me either.”

“I bet it’s easier seeing as how you have an intern to fuck.”

That shut her up. She turned away from me and looked out the window, her tears fogging the glass. As soon as we pulled into the driveway she got out of the car, running her hands through her hair. 

“We will find her, I know we—hey! What are you doing? Where are you going?!”

I had peeled the car out of the driveway, reaching over to slam her door shut from the inside. 

“I’m finding our daughter.”

I left her standing in the driveway, screaming my name as she fell to her knees, sobbing. 

Knees...her knees. Fuck. It’s coming back. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Her auburn hair was even prettier in my fist. It looked like blood as I grabbed it between my fingers. I shoved her in the shed as she struggled to get passed me. 

“Mike, Mike please!” she sobbed as I shut the door and locked it behind me. 

She looked so pitiful, crouched on her knees. Her blue dress had ridden up to her hips, her bare legs shone in the moonlight that filtered through the shed windows. God, she was gorgeous. Why hadn’t Stan fucked her yet? 

“Mike, please just let me go,” her lips begged. But her eyes, oh god her eyes. They begged me to fuck her. 

I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, staring at her on the floor. 

“I just want to talk.”

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The car hummed beneath my fingers as I pushed the pedal down all the way to the floor. I knew where Stan was. I knew where he was keeping Katie. That fucking, sick bastard. 

I still remembered the route to Keith’s house. It only took me twenty minutes until I pulled up to the abandoned, overgrown two-story house on the corner of the block. A car was already neatly parked in the driveway. He was here. 

Instead of walking up to the house I headed back to the shed in the woods. Nausea erupted in my stomach as my foggy, sleep-deprived mind kept showing me images of what happened that night. Flashes—quick flashes of Lily. Fuck.  

As I walked deeper into the woods I could remember how Lily screamed that night. How I covered her mouth with my hand and ripped her dress, the blue fabric coming off in ribbons. I remember how she stopped screaming at one point and just sobbed. Her tears soaked my hands. I finished inside of her, kissing her neck and telling her how beautiful she was.  

I raped her. I raped Lily.  

As soon as I saw the shed I knew. I remembered everything. I remembered how I left her crying on the floor, heading back to the party and taking a beer from a teammate. I remember how I drank more and more, laughing when I saw her holding herself as she reappeared in the light. 

I walked into the shed, my head hung low. It was different than it had looked that night. The walls were painted pink, decorated with flowers and pictures of horses. A small, twin bed sat in the corner, garnished with teddy bears and pillows. 

“Daddy!” A small form shot towards me, hugging my waist. “Oh daddy he said you would come! He said you would come play!” Katie smiled back up at me, completely unfazed by the situation laid out before her.

Stan smiled from the corner, his hands thrust behind his back. 

“I knew you would come.” His voice was eerily calm. 

“Stan,” I pleaded. “Oh God, I’m so sorry.”

He smiled, walking closer to us. I hugged my daughter to me. 

“Do you know what happened after you raped Lily?”

I winced at the words. My daughter looked up at me. “Daddy, what’s rape?”

Stan grinned wider. “Rape? Oh, it’s something bad your daddy did a long time ago, sweetheart.” 

Katie frowned, her eyebrows furrowing together in confusion. “Why would you do something bad?”

My chest felt heavy and tight. “I, I—“

“Your daddy is a bad man, that’s why.” Stan said. All traces of his smile were gone. 

“What happened to Lily?”

“She was pregnant, Mike. You got her pregnant.”

There was a full, heavy pause. Katie tugged at the bottom of my shirt. 

“You raped her, Mike. And then she became pregnant. She told me when she was two weeks late. She told me exactly what happened.”

“Stan...”

“I said I would stay with her, I would love her. I promised I would love her and the child.”

Stan moved closer. I could see the glint of a gun behind his back. 

“I promised I would love her and the child. But she couldn’t love herself after what you did, Mike. She couldn’t look herself in the mirror. She killed herself when she was eight months pregnant. She killed herself, and my daughter, because of you.”

I began to openly weep, pulling Katie in closer. 

“We even had a name picked out for the baby. Can you guess what it was?”

“Stan, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry I did this.”

“This?” He laughed. “You *raped* her, Mike. Be a man enough to say the word.”

“Mary?”

Stan smiled sadly. “That would have been my daughter’s name. Or, *your* daughter’s name,” He sighed. “If you want to be accurate, that is.” 

“Please don’t hurt Katie, she didn’t do this to you. I did this to you. I did this to Lily.”

Stan was so close that he was now almost touching me and my daughter. 

“No, I wouldn’t hurt Katie,” He whispered as he patted her head. “She’s innocent. But you? You aren’t.”

“Stan, I—“ a shot rang out through the air. My daughter screamed as blood splattered her face. 

Stan fell to the floor, a hole blooming out of his forehead.  It looked as beautiful as a lily. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. I didn't remember. No, I did, I just...I just didn't *want* to remember. 

I'm turning myself in tonight. I'm...guys, I'm so sorry. I know Stan wanted me to watch him die so I would have one more life's blood on my hands. 

Lily. Mary. Stan. 

It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

NO companies have replied to this date. Idk why.

I am a high schooler that will be a senior this fall by the way.

I know that big companies like NASA and Google and Facebook have an application process that start at the beginning of the school year, but as far as I know, new , start-up companies don't have much of a policy for internships. 

If you guys know someone or are looking for yourself, any computer science (front-end web dev) interns in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley/San Jose / Mountain View/ California) please let me know.

I am really passionate about coding and creating, and will do nothing but benefit any company. 

I also have a resume and website with sample projects I made (and I made the website myself with HTML/CSS/JS, I didn't use weebly or wix or something).

Please respond fast! Summer is almost here and I don't want to sit around doing nothing! I have not been procrastinating as I started on my resume and website last year and sent them to numerous start-up companies since early this year.

Current company/pay:

Company Location: Hardware company located in Sunnyvale
Company Size: 50+ employees (I joined when there were ~15 employees)

Salary: $120k

Equity: 0.5% of company (my GUESS is exit by ~50-100M acquisition in the next few years)

Experience: 4.5 years (this is my first job out of college, not including a few internships with the Big 4 during college)

Role: Firmware Engineer

Work hours: average of 60hrs/wk, up to 85

I was trusted with the responsibility of overseeing the firmware of our main products last year and was informed that I've been handling this responsibility well. My other responsibilities include mentoring other engineers and interfacing with core customers. 
I am grateful to be trusted with these privileges because this is great on my resume. 

Onto my issue. I recently found out the colleagues I mentor (who work on minor features and/or bug fixes) are pulling in a salary of $110k with 0.45% equity - they casually mentioned it in a lunch room conversation. Since they started at this company the same time I did as college graduates also, this means I am getting slightly larger raises. Now, here is the part that bothers me. I carry more responsibilities than they do and I honestly thought there would be a larger discrepancy in our compensation packages. I have pulled many all nighters to successfully fix bugs that our major customers were angry about. I work on average 60 hours a week while said colleagues work on average 40, sometimes 50 - I know this because I work closely with a few of them. I initially justified my long hours to the nature of a startup and the illusion that I was going to be compensated fairly but I'm feeling this isn't true. After I learned of my peers' salaries, I spoke with the execs regarding an equity increase using my responsibilities as justification (I didn't mention names or others' compensation). The response I was given was basically a TBD. If my request for an increase is denied, I am thinking about walking. Can you guys give me your opinion and/or experience with these type of situations? Am I being too irrational here? 

P.S. I apologize if I came off as whiny, conceited, or condescending - that is not my intention. Nor am I trying to bash my coworkers - they are great people.

Thanks in advance.

My programming journey is a very tangled one, stuck in what seems to be an infinite loop, with no progress whatsoever over the course of... 7 years. I couldn't help but include some aspects of my personal life which I found crucial to the story. I hope I chose the right place to post it.
Here it goes...

I've been exposed to programming for the first time in my first year of high-school. After some initial struggle with its purpose (due to my teacher's questionable methods), something clicked and it suddenly became all very clear and logic to me. I was taught concepts such as recursivity, algorithms (Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, Binary Search), data structures (Arrays, Lists, Graphs) in C++ (without the OOP and classes) and had quite a good grasp of them. I used to have a book filled with programming problems (ya know, tiny things such as greatest prime number in a row) and worked through all of them, even optional ones. However I didn't take the step further to actually get to apply my knowledge to more real-life problems and stuck to cute little problems in the console.
And then university happened. I applied to a couple of Russel Group universities, got accepted at 4/5, picked one and there I was in the fall of 2014. I can still remember the dread I felt during my first night in my dorm room. Something didn't feel right. I started having an anxiety disorder. Since this isn't the anxiety subreddit, I'll leave out the details. I'll just resume to saying that I started doubting myself. These thoughts persisted day and night and in every second of my life there was a voice who was saying that for everything I did, there was someone doing it better (be it cooking, socializing, tying a knot, ANYTHING). And boy, it was overwhelming. Then, naturally, I started having concentration, learning, memory problems. Paranoia kicked in (I was fearing that all of my colleagues and university staff knew about me) so I didn't go to courses anymore. Basically I felt too stupid to be there. The most cherished moments were the ones I understood (an explanation) or achieved something (like cooking a meal). Unfortunately, it was not enough. Objectively speaking, it was all great: the courses, the staff, the opportunities (and the list could go on forever). But I was feeling so terrible that I couldn't enjoy any of it.


I've managed to finish my first year with an upper-second grade, but not the second one. So I was granted an interruption. I went back to my country, went to therapy, was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, took anti depressives. And I started getting better and felt ready to tackle the second year for the second time. However, instead of focusing on my learning or future, I got the taste of happiness again and started doing things for my pleasure. I felt as if I could live again. I traveled quite a lot, met a lot of people, did a variety of small jobs throughout the year, bought a camera and some lenses, started mingling with photography. With summer approaching, I knew I should pick up where I left off (with programming), since it was beginning to fade away, but I was somehow very scared. Truth be told, I am quite a slow learner (in high-school I used to keep a separate sketchbook and draw boxes keeping track of variables) and also a bit disorganized. I applied to a couple of internships, hoping that I might get the discipline from an external source, but I didn't have enough experience to get in any of them. Summer was almost over and I started getting nightmares and anxiety again. Despite the signs that it wasn't right for me, I still went. And, as you can imagine, it was a disaster. So ridiculous of me. This time I felt as if I became a living vegetable. I thought there was no way out. In December 2016, I withdrew. Some relatives picked me up and drove me home thousands of miles (cancelled my plane tickets since I was too weak to travel by plane).

Ever since, I lost the support and trust of everyone around me. With the help of my parents, I managed to get my first job as a junior C#/.NET developer at a relative's company. I didn't know any C#/.NET so I followed some tutorials on Udemy to get ready for the job. Three weeks in, and I realize what a place I'm in. The company's IT department is only 2 years old. A group of 9 students used to work there and did all their software, but they all left in the meantime, leaving no documentation behind and a lot of spaghetti code (there was a WinForm application containing 12000 lines of code in a single file). The boss has no minimal desire for good software, is focused on delivery, has no notion of software engineering practices and treats me like shit. Anxiety intensifies. I have to keep my shit together in order to keep this job. So I spend hours trying to decipher and understand previous applications, while studying C#/.NET to solve bugs. We're talking about a POS application which is already in hundreds of gas stations. There's 2 junior developers in the room and another 6 people at the help-desk. Customers keep calling about bugs and new functionalities. Senior developers keep popping up for short periods of time, but they leave because of the horrible conditions and the boss' attitude. Pay is good though. Anyway, boss changes approach towards new senior developers (in order to make them stay), manages to make a small team and puts me on an entirely new project - a contract management system, which would be part of a future ERP. I have one week to show him a draft. Glad I got rid of those ugly apps and frenetically search for developing web apps from scratch. Start looking for a new bunch of tutorials: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/.NET MVC. Get excited because I fancied Web Development. Boss likes the draft. I am now my own boss. Now every day I wake up, grab my laptop, move to work, plug my headphones in and watch tutorials for the first half of the day, then I practice. People rarely talk to me and have no idea what I'm working on. Putting the app on its feet went smoothly, now I start to get my first bugs and it all becomes confusing. A month later, my three-month trial finishes and boss tells me he has to let me go because he needs visionaries in his company and I am a sheep. Have a breakdown, go to therapy for first time in months, found out that I have borderline personality disorder. Holy. Fuck.

So yeah, this has been my staggering journey so far. I'm 21 years old, it's been 7 years and I've no idea where I am, nor where I'm heading. At this point, I'm sick of beginner and ""Introduction to..."" tutorials but I think I have no choice. It's been three weeks since I've been sacked and I haven't touched a line of code. With the money I saved, I took a break and went to the seaside. Every time I take a break, I feel as if I forgot everything and feel the need to start afresh. Programming is no joke. It's been years since I've solved a coding problem (with my job I was basically a developer, just putting things together for them to work). Now I'm back, my head is a bit clearer and I want to give it another go. I'm not a bright mind and not a potential brilliant programmer/developer, but I feel there is something in me that I can work on, and, on top of that, I still enjoy it and would absolutely love to create something. I'm just the type of person who needs some (maybe a lot of) guidance. I also get distracted in this myriad of resources the internet has to offer (one day I'm into UI, another I'm interested in microcontrollers). Give a man a million resources and he'll seize the opportunities, give me the same and I'll get scared and lost.

Therefore, programmer's community of reddit, I'm begging you, give me some guidance, articles, learning paths, links, life advice, cooking tips, anything!!!"

Since it is a reputable company, I would not expect them to withdraw this offer, though I know if they did there is nothing I could do about it. I would think that they wouldn't do so unless I somehow did something that would provide them good reason to, because otherwise it would make the company's hiring department seem unprofessional, no?

(3) PreCalc : C

2nd Semester:

(3) Intro Compsci : C

(3) Advanced Spanish : C+

(4) Calculus 1 : TBA

*(Pass/Fail Class that won't factor into my GPA)

This might be a bit premature because I don't have my calculus grade but I don't think it's good - probably a C maybe a D. I just feel extremely frustrated because I worked extremely hard in my Compsci class and towards the end of the semester I got mono. I emailed my prof asked for an extension and that still wasn't enough. Staring at a computer screen while sick was hard to do. I took that exam and my other ones while not feeling well and on a bunch of drugs. My compsci final was worth so much and I did so poorly, my A dropped to a C. I was getting by with a B in Spanish the entire semester but getting sick caused  that to drop to a C+. I'm worried about my Calculus grade... I aced homeowrk and quizzes but my tests were low 70s. I did pretty poorly on one of them and my prof offered to replace our lowest grade with our final exam grade. Since I wasn't in a good state of my mind, I think I did poorly on the final. if worst comes to worst I can retake the class. But I also don't want to get behind and not graduate on time. This whole situation is frustrating because I've had trouble with schoolwork in the past but this semester I finally established study methods and tactics and was doing well until I became sick and bedridden.

I'm just finished my first year of general engineering and am currently debating whether to get a full time summer job, such as at a grocery store, or to focus on making iOS apps. I'm going into computer engineering as I've really enjoyed programming in the past year. My skills are rather limited which is why I want to make apps as it interests and will help me learn a lot. However, I have zero work experience from high school and only some minor volunteering. Is it better for me to just get a job for the sake of experience or should I focus on technical skills? I plan on pursuing engineering internships next year when I'll have more school skills.

Thanks!"

69pzws,3,2017-05-07,Feeling discouraged,sandkassel,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/69pzws/feeling_discouraged/,"Hey! So I'm feeling pretty down and out about engineering. I love the field and I couldn't imagine doing anything else, but I'm starting to feel like I can't keep up. I'm going into my second year feeling like I will not have a chance to redeem myself. I fear I will do poorly again.

My GPA sits at a 2.48.

My first semester I started at Michigan Tech as a computer engineer, and quickly learned that I can't get by like I did in high school, and I actually had to study and get help. By the time I realized this I was in week 9, and already had a bad base of grades. I had nothing below a C, but I knew I needed help. I started working really hard and improving, but I threw it all away with finals. I didn't know how to study and did not study enough. I finished the semester with a 2.63. I also learned that I didn't enjoy coding as much and decided I wanted to switch to mechanical engineering. Because of my grades, I was told I could not change until I earned a C or better in calc 2 and physics 1. 

My second semester started out stronger. I knew how to study better and knew I needed to work hard. 

I thought I had been doing better. My life revolved around studying and apart from calc 2 was doing well. Calc 2 was hard but my professor was excellent in helping me and my roommate. I ended up missing my second physics midterm due to extreme illness, do I was told they would average my first and third. I did poorly on my third. Now I need a 70 or better on the final to get a C so I can change departments. 

In order to get a C in calc 2, I had to get a 58% on my final. I thought I had calc in the bag and it would be easy to achieve. I was doing better than all of my friends. Because I wasn't doing well in physics, I started focusing my attention on that. I could only afford to get 11 wrong on the physics final. I studied the whole week, and it paid off, I only got 10 wrong. I had a day to study for calc now, and I realized I had totally fucked myself over. I crammed the best I could, but when I sat down at that last exam, I freaked out. I blanked. I left pages incomplete. I went from a 75% in the class to a 62%. My final exam score was 38%. I needed a C to change majors and to take statics. My GPA now is at 2.48.

I'm worried because I have to retake calc 2 and take chem 1 and physics 2 in the same semester. I know they will all be challenging. I fear I will only sink further in GPA. I really want an internship next summer. I'm feeling really discouraged. Any advice? Thanks!

I got an internship position at Texas Instruments from July 2017 to January 2018, and am currently searching for an apartment / flatshare / room. I'm a French electrical engineering student (24 year old) doing my master degree in Switzerland (EPFL).

I don't know the area around Freising at all, so I'm hoping you guys could give me a few recommendations ?

Some considerations:
I don't own a car so most of traveling will be on foot or public transportation (maybe I'll get a bike, depends on the distance between my place &amp; TI).
I wouldn't mind a longer commute (like, 30-40 minutes, not more) as long as the apartment is in a good location. (What are good locations in Freising?)

I'm hoping to find a place with a maximum rent of 500€ for a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom or studio apartment or flatshare. Is it a decent budget for Freising?

I might aswell consider searching around Munich area, I've heard the public transportation around Munich is pretty good, is that doable to commute everyday back and forth Munich to TI?

I'll be continuing my search so any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated! I'd also love to hear any TI stories you may have!

It was a great opportunity for me, and while they did offer me a fulltime position, I turned it down for a great opportunity with a security company. I just feel that the title IT intern sells my experience short that I got there. I aced any technical questions I was asked in EVERY interview, in fact the only interview with even 1 question I didnt easily know (but could allude to the answer or make an educated deduction about it) was for the position I just accepted. The reason I ask this is because the position I took was way better benefits, pay, and technical knowledge-wise then several of the jobs I wasnt even offered a second interview for.

I did mean stack, android and Cordova, rest apis, DB arch. , light embedded stuff, and aws administration. Used altassian project management software. Truly a full stack experience. Lots of coding and debugging. 

How should I market this when I start looking for work? Friend said I should just call it a paid internship and be humble.

69tgz1,165,2017-05-07,What do you mean you didn't order where to do it?,isthistechsupport,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/69tgz1/what_do_you_mean_you_didnt_order_where_to_do_it/,"Hello TFTS, today I would like to share with you all a story I had to endure once as a small dept developer/tech support guy.  

So, in my long way across the phones of the help desks and call centers of my country, I once had the opportunity to rise from the help desk and work in the development of a database for our clients, to make the feedback between our OPS and their QA more streamlined and generally easier and faster to handle.  

To this end, our interns would take the files with the raw data from an FTP (they were provided by the clients), give them a quick look to make sure they comforted to our standard and upload them. One of these files would contain the information about the starting and ending dates of each line of business of our clients so the system could provide historic data if needed but don't show empty rows for inactive lines of business in the next dates.  

So it begins the story.  

Our actors will be:  
$me: Guess who that is,  
$workmate: Again, self explanatory,  
$intern: This would be the intern who was in shift that day.  
$client: One of our biggest clients.

So it's late morning and I'm sitting in my desk, looking at my empty mug and wondering if there's fresh coffee in the canteen, along with crackers or other snack, when my phone rings. It's $client's number.

&gt;$client: Hi, is this $me from &lt;dept&gt;?  
&gt;$me: Hi $client, yes, this is me. How may I help you today?  
&gt;$client: Yeah, look, we closed today this &lt;line of business&gt; but it's still appearing in the system, would you mind checking out what happened?  
&gt;$me: Yeah, sure, give me a second and I'll check the database.  

Fortunately, these kind of errors would usually arise because the lines' end dates hadn't been updated yet in our database, so we would start by querying the table and checking if that was the case. It was.

&gt;$me: Okay, I just looked into it, and it seems today's raw data didn't carry a end date for the &lt;line of business&gt;, but you just need to send us the row you need to change to &lt;dept's email address&gt; and we'll do the change and update the system as soon as it's done.  
&gt;$client: Yeah, sure, I'll do that right away then. Thank you!  
&gt;$me: No problem, have a good day!  

So I immediately called our intern, since we had hacked together a small, rudimentary GUI for they to be able to carry out these kind of manual updates without having to know SQL. However, since the guy was quite promising, we were teaching him the basics of the language anyways and encouraged him to practice on his free time with a local instance we had set up in his computer. 

&gt;$me: Hey $intern, how's the day going?  
&gt;$intern: Pretty good, boss (technically his boss was my boss, but he'd take instructions from me as well). How's it going over there?  
&gt;$me: Good, I'm not complaining. Hey, $client is going to send an email for &lt;I explained him the situation&gt;. I just need you to fire up the system and update the end date so it'll be solved, alright? Oh, and also send him a mail back once it's done. Don't forget to CC me and $boss.  
&gt;$intern: Sure, I can totally do that. Anything else?  
&gt;$me: No, that'll be all. I'll call you later if I need anything. Oh, and if anyone calls, I went for a coffee. I'll be back in 5 minutes or so.  
&gt;$intern: Alright, see you later.  

I went for my coffee, came back about 10 minutes later, checked the mail and everything had been done already. I ran an update on the system to make sure the changes were appearing to the clients and was ready to read some more TFTS for, ahem, scientific purposes, when my phone rang again. It's $client again.

&gt;$me: Hi $client, we just did the change, it should show in your screen now *I thought he called to follow up on the issue*  
&gt;$client: Yeah, I know, now the whole interface is blank!  
&gt;$me: *all blood drained from my face in a split second* Wait, what? Let me verify what's going on.  

So I queried the table. Now, it resulted the whole of the lines' table had end dates for every line. Active lines would have a NULL there, but this was not the case. I immediately went over to $intern's desk.

&gt;$me: Hey, $intern, did you already do the update?  
&gt;$intern: Yeah, why? *noticing how pale and hurried I was* Is something wrong?  
&gt;$me: Yes, the whole table is wrong. May I see the GUI? *Since my boss and I had put it together, I feared it had a bug with the WHERE clause*  

His face got pale too. I saw that he had an open instance of our SQL IDE and immediately noticed the error.

&gt;$me: Wait, you coded the update yourself instead of using the GUI? *he would have needed write credentials which he didn't have, but it seemed plausible anyways*  
&gt;$intern: No, no! I used the GUI! Look! *he showed me the GUI log*  
&gt;$me: Yes, okay, but what's that instance of the IDE for, then?  
&gt;$intern: I had duplicated the table to my local instance and was running the equivalent command on it to practice with it, that's all.  
&gt;$me: Okay... let me check. *I noticed the IDE was pointing to the production server*  
&gt;$me: It's not your local instance! It's the server! What code did you run?  
&gt;$intern: Here, look! *as it turns out he had forgotten the where clause and updated the whole freaking table, breaking down the report*  
&gt;$me: How did you get access to this?  
&gt;$intern: $workmate had his computer freeze while running a query, and asked to use my computer to verify if it had been commited or rolled back.

As it turns out $workmate had forgotten to point the IDE back to the local instance, and $intern wasn't aware of how to verify that, since under usual circumstances he'd never need to check that.

In the end, I had to spend the rest of the morning restoring the table and doing damage control to make sure the incident wasn't escalated further. $workmate had a memo issued for using someone else's computer, $intern got one as well for running code without being qualified for doing so, and my coffee got cold in the meantime... which, I think, was the worst part of it all.

I have been living a weird life in academia, I am 24 years old and I have no career experience yet.

 I went to UT Austin for Biology, but I had never planned on going to college and everyone was telling me about all the cool stuff I could do. During this time I liked learning about CS, my father has been a software engineer since the 80s but he never talked to me about his job. Anyways I get the degree in 4 years total time (i lost a lot of transfer credits from a CC), which was hard. Cool, but I don't really want to do this for a living.

I went back to school for C.S. and now I've done enough Pre Reqs to get into a M.S. Computer Science program(at Univ of Houston).I did not apply to UT M.S. C.S. mostly because of the PTSD from working my ass off but also because I had pre reqs to complete and UH had a later deadline.

I hate my dumb self for not knowing what I wanted to do when I was young, and not choosing to apply to CS at UT instead of Biology. 

I asked UT Comp Sci if they would let me go to their career fair, they said yes bc I am an alumni.

So my questions are these:

 1. Is it advantageous for me to go to UTs career fairs aswell when looking for an internship or job in the future?

 2. Will it seem weird to a recruiter at UT fairs with this combination on my resume?

B.S. Biology UT 2015
M.S Comp Science UH 2019

And even if so will it still show that I am a competitive student (that I am *as* competitive/hard-working as a UT computer science student even though UH is ranked much lower).

 3. Will the UT Austin name on my resume help me get noticed? (It has in the past when interviewers tell me but idk if this would happen regularly)

If anyone with technical recruiting experience could answer this it would help a lot for me to gauge how much I messed up. I expect to do as many projects as possible and join some machine learning clubs.

My predicament lies in this simple statement: I eat human brains. I have eaten human brains for several years now. Unfortunately, I appear younger in my immortality, so every couple of decades, I must resurface with a new identity, purpose, and an “insatiable knack” for neurosurgery. The ethical dilemma I face is the difficult restraint I face when operating. I have been known to remove slightly larger portions than necessary, just to curb my appetite later. I perform many, intricate, detailed, and extremely precise surgeries that offer me the option of complete control of my favorite human delight. Even morsels that are cancer ridden tumors are still delicious when prepared properly. I have maintained this elaborate ruse for cannibalistic mastication for several lifetimes now.

Alas, I seem to have finally crossed the Hippocratic Oath line, per se. As far as I knew, I was the only being on earth with this blessing/curse. I have searched every few years for another, only finding freaks that are obsessed with zombie culture instead. It’s hard to find a real immortal with a specific palette such as mine. The other evening, after performing a routine resection of an epileptic, I casually placed my future dinner to the side for “further examination”, only to discover it had completely vanished. I hadn’t consumed in a few days, and the urge deep within was becoming very restless. I don’t have another opportunity to tactfully extract brain matter for another 2 days. I know my restless curb will violate my modern modus operandi that excludes violent back-alley murders and I will be forced to consume like a morally diseased monster.

As I was internally fuming from my carefully constructed plan, I found my anesthesiologist tossing the container I had set aside for the meal in the rubbish bin. Included in his refuse deposit was a plastic fork, wrapped in a napkin neatly. I was left to assume he had just consumed my favorite delicacy, in its raw state. I was forced to follow him.

He moved about the hospital with the same ease as myself, since we are both higher tiered specialists for this establishment. He did his usual checking out ho-hum drum routine before finally leaving to his vehicle in the staff garage. I waited until he was a few steps away from his vehicle before confronting him. I slyly queried regarding the recent surgery we had worked and if he noticed anything peculiar about the sample. He lied to me, saying he had not seen it since I removed it. I retorted with his careful ejection of his meal evidence, and called me mad. MAD! He had just eaten raw brain, and I was the mad one! He reached for something and my inner beast awoke. I lunged at him and tore into his throat with my bare hands, tearing out his Adams Apple with graceful ease. He choked on his own blood for a few moments, leering at me with his dishonest eyes.

It wasn’t until he expired that I realized he wasn’t immortal such as myself. I cannot die. Believe me, in more desperate lifetimes, I have attempted to taste the sweet savory flavor of death, but she has eluded me thus far. I have survived for worse injuries than I had inflicted upon the anesthesiologist in the past. I tore open his abdomen, and removed his stomach. Examining the contents, I discovered not one trace of my precious entrée inside. I carefully moved his corpse to the trunk of his vehicle, and crushed his skull, stealing the intelligent fat encased within.

I am now sitting in my vehicle, just a few rows away, searing his brain with my cigarette lighter in small, bite-sized morsels, watching the zoo of police unfold on the scene like a tidal wave blue, sharp suits. I have broken my rule, and now I must restart anew. I am only sharing this since I believe that someone is out there, akin to ,you idiosyncrasies and needs, and may be able to assist me in my endeavors in the next lifetime I must evolve into. I know you exist. You ate my sample. I want for us to collaborate and excel together, instead of hide from each other. Also, I am looking for an internship in a teaching hospital that I can excel my “insatiable knack of the delicate intricacies of the human brain” once more. I am quite renowned and recognizable, so I may need to alter my appearance, but can you fine folks offer a few suggestions in those departments? Thank you in advance.

69vwe9,1,2017-05-08,Profile Review for 23 Year Old,goldfarr27,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/69vwe9/profile_review_for_23_year_old/,"Hi!

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this post. I would like to see how my profile is shaping up for when I pull the trigger. FYI, my dream schools are UCLA, HBS, NYU, COLUMBIA, STANFORD, and USC. I'm hoping to get an expert opinion.

I went to a top 30 liberal arts school. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Summa Cum Laude, 3.9 GPA with a double major in Econ and Film and finished my degrees in 3 and 1/2 years. I was an RA, played club sports, did theater and wrote screenplays. During undergrad, I worked in entertainment at three Academy Award winning production companies and for WME as an intern. When I graduated early, I got a job at Ernst and Young as a consultant in financial advisory which I did for 8 months before shifting back to the entertainment industry where I currently work (at a top 4 talent agency in the Film Finance and Sales group) i was promoted out of the finance group to work for the head of our motion picture group. I will either stay here until I apply to B-school in the fall of 2017 or 2018 or I will shift to a Studio, preferably in the strategy or marketing space or back into consulting, but at the senior level with an entertainment/media focus.

My main question is should i apply in 2017 and have 2.5 years or WE at matriculation of apply in 2018 and have 3.5 years WE? Will that extra year make a huge difference. Plus, if i were to get a new job next January, would three jobs pre-MBA look really bad if they all are in an upward direction and fit my goals?

on the GMAT side: Tough road of studying but pulled out a 710! 47 Math, 40 Verbal. 6 AWA and 6 IR.

Throughout the next two years, I plan on doing volunteer work with my company and on my own. I also am an active stock options trader on the side as a hobby. I am a white man FYI and only 22.

With all that info, do I have a shot at any of my dream schools listed above?

Thank you for your time and response!"

Everything started when I graduated undergrad last year, and I feel like it just got amplified when I turned 25 two months ago.

I majored in political science with the intent on going to law school, and I got rejected from all of my choice schools and that was a real hard blow, and I have just been studying to retake my entrance exam to boost my score and hopefully get in. 

I lost my job a few weeks ago at the law firm I was working at, and I feel like the more exposure I get to the legal profession, the less and less it appeals to me. I wanted to be an attorney my entire life, and I feel like everything around me has just been systematically destroying my desire and every attorney that I have dealt with or worked for has just been hard to deal with. I got a job at a law firm two years ago and I quit almost immediately because the attorney that hired me was a psycho, I literally walked out on the third day because all she did was yell and scream at everyone, clients, other attorneys, me, the secretary. I got the job that I just lost a few weeks ago and I had been at this firm for a year and a half. The people at the firm were easy enough to deal with, but it just seemed like everyone I encountered was unhappy, and I didn't really notice all of this until I was working in the environment. There is one attorney that I am friends with, but I feel like that one shining example is not enough to persuade me.

There was an alternate career path that I was considering and that was in video production, I started doing that when I was in junior high, and then I became the videographer for our schools theater group, then from there I took some video classes at the local community college and I landed an internship at a local company. I basically taught myself how to do everything before I even took classes and I later got a job in the video department because of my performance and a recommendation from a professor before I ultimately decided to go the legal route instead of the creative video route because I thought there was more money to be made in law as opposed to video.

Also, all of my friends moved away, and I feel like I am just kind of stuck without any surefire path to go on.

I really do not want to make any kind of rash or uneducated decisions, lately my mind has just been skipping around about what to do, I do not know if I should stay the course with law and hope things get better, jump back into video and do another year in undergrad to earn the degree in that, decide to pursue a different route with my political science degree? 

I feel like I am in the middle of a quarter life crisis, and I am having a very difficult time navigating it. Any advice is appreciated, thanks! "

I'm in my second year of uni studying computer science in the UK. It's becoming more clear to me now that my interests do not lie in software engineering but more towards theoretical computer science. Specifically, I enjoyed my modules about computability and complexity - Turing machines, formal languages, P vs NP etc.

I am wondering what sort of careers in industry these interests would be suited for, if any? And any ideas of what sort of internships would be beneficial would be great too. My chosen final year modules are a based on graph theory, computer vision and then some embedded/real-time systems stuff.

I'm not at a school known for its undergrad program. I would argue I have a fairly impressive resume compared to my peers (at least they all tell me so). My only issue is with GPA (about 2.2 cumulative).

As of today, I still have no plans for this summer and I'm very concerned. Last fall I convinced myself that I would need to take summer classes and so I didn't apply to internships. Around February I realized how stupid that was and found several still open to apply to. I've only heard back from one (negative), the others I'm quite sure must have been filled by now.

Option 1: should I start reaching out to these companies to see what's the deal? How do you go about finding the right point of contact? Or maybe there are more still open that I haven't found and I'm just not looking hard enough?

Option 2: perhaps should I give up on getting an internship this summer? I could use the time to work on learning new technologies and make even more impressive side projects. Maybe take two classes. I have a programming job on campus. 

Option 3: I could try to get an internship/co-op for the fall and delay my graduation by one semester to fall 2018. Has anyone tried this, and if so how did it work out?

Option 4: I'm aware of the usual advice to find work/research in the department; this is what I did last summer. There is still one research position open which I wouldn't mind, but I was really hoping for industry experience to put on my resume.

What are your thoughts? Feel free to ask me to elaborate on anything if necessary. Thanks in advance for your input!

---

TL;DR: I screwed most of my summer options by being late to the game. Should I still expect anything or should I take classes this summer? What about looking for an internship in the fall instead?"

None of these programs really stand out to me nor prepare me that well for a specific career path in which I’m interested. Frankly, I feel like that I’m going to make the same mistake with my bachelors and get a degree that takes me a year of longer to find a lackluster or underpaid job with. 

The school is pretty small, isn’t very prestigious, in the South, and its specialty is education degrees. Which degree do you think would be most productive for me? I’m not averse to additional schooling afterwards (phd or professional degree), but I’d be an idiot to not take up a free masters when given the chance, especially since I already don’t have any student loans. Would a second bachelors be more useful than one of these masters?

Like anyone, a fantastic income would be nice – but all I really need is a place to myself, a car payment, and to get a dog (my goal after a program is a 50k salary). Whatever path I take, it must have good career-building potential. I don’t want to do the same middle-wage job for 40 years and I MUST be able to move out of the small town I currently live and work in as soon as possible after I get this degree, I hate it here. 

So, Reddit, if you were in my shoes what do you think the best choice is? If you wanted to maximize on-the-job happiness and pay, how would you maximize your odds? I’m trying to be responsible and do the right thing but poor planning can easily negate that. School counselors are shit, never give good advice, and just tell you what you want to hear. I’m first generation college and my friends / family can’t really give any good advice so I’m coming to you guys.

Thank you in advance! Just a diversity of quick opinions would be super helpful. Thanks.

When I applied for a full-time position, I was able to make it to the final round when they fly you to Washington and do a day long interview. But then I got rejected. I applied to Google online never was able to land an internship, but when I applied through a recruiter, I was able to land an interview. After two months I was rejected. I applied to Facebook via online application. But Facebook never got back to me. 

I've been interning to other places. But the only reason why I want a job to those company is because of the resources since some of their researches align with my interest and experience. I am also aware that there are candidates that are WAYYYY better than me. But then again, in every interview, I tried showing my analytical thinking, problem solving and optimization abilities. 

I'm trying to figure out why I can't land a job there. Did any of you experience the same issues? Am I overseeing something important? Do I need to know people in the company personally to be able to even land an interview? I just need an answer so I can try to improve myself. "

I am finishing my Junior year as a CS major, and I am starting an IT internship at a financial institution in two weeks. I haven't had many classes in networking or security, so I am hoping to take a bit of a self-guided crash course in those. I was wondering what resources would be good starting points so I could have a little bit of knowledge coming into the program. 

Specifically, I was told that I would be a part of an ""Intranet redesign"" and doing ""vulnerability management activities."" During my interviews, I was asked a lot of questions about TCP/IP, and firewalls, ports, stuff like that. 

I was thinking about reading materials for certifications, like Network+ and Security+ or CCENT and CCNA-Security (I don't know if this company uses Cisco devices). Does that seem like a good idea, or should I look at something else? Thanks!"

I'm currently actually a first year masters student in Software Engineering at a small state school in Wisconsin, but my Bachelor's is in Physics w/ a computational emphasis from the same school. For an undergrad, I had a fairly large amount of research experience in nuclear physics (2 internships and credit for research almost every semester). 

Today I received my letter of acceptance into UW-Madison's Nuclear Engineering MS program. There's a few reasons I'm conflicted in this:

* Currently paying for school, although I have a solid paying internship and I would have to pay for school if I changed as well (late applicant and MS student). I am curious if it would be possible to do a year there, then reapply for a Ph.D and hope to get funding.
* Lifestyle: my gut tells me my life would be dramatically different going down both roads. I would be nervous of my life being entirely consumed if I went the Ph.D route. I love nuclear sciences and understand graduate school kind of sucks for everyone (I admittedly feel like I'm still in undergrad), but I'm unsure of any job prospects for someone with a grad degree in nuclear eng. that have a more reasonable work load. I would probably be shooting for a national lab position optimally.
* Nervous about ""going back"" on my choice. I was very burnt out after undergrad and after a relaxed summer ended up being very ready to jump back into something more intense. Mid way through fall semester I began feeling like I didn't really fit in the field of CS/software. I particularly find myself lacking passion about the idea of a career in business applied software, which is what my current internship is in.

Has anyone been in a similar scenario, or has any experience with UW-Madison/nuclear engineering etc.? Any input is greatly appreciated, thanks again."

I’ve been reading this sysadmin page for quite some time now and this is my first time posting in here so I apologize if there has already been a discussion about this before.

I just graduated last week at a local technical school earning my associates degrees with Networking and System Administration, and security.  For the past few years as being a student, I’ve had several classes with the most recent versions of Windows Server, Linux, VMWare Virtualization, and Information Security just to name a few.  In these classes, I’ve had plenty of hands on experience with Windows Server environments, Cisco networking, DNS, DHCP, Active Directory deployment, Exchange, WSUS, Virtualization environments, Linux administrations, etc.
I’m currently participating in an internship program at a local MSP company who does IT work for small businesses in the area.  This internship gets students involved with PC troubleshooting, Active Directory management, cleanups, virus removal, staging, and installations.

In a couple of weeks, I will be starting an entry level help desk position for a major regional hospital in my city.

Now to my question, I feel like I’ve learned a lot with my jobs and schooling, but for those of you that work or have worked in a helpdesk environment, what tips could you give to someone who is fresh out of college and is looking for a future in IT?  Also, what tips do you recommended someone doing on their own time to keep their knowledge fresh?  Such as reading IT news, subscribing to YouTube channels, or making my own lab environments? (I’ve been glancing at r/homelab).

6a34tt,18,2017-05-08,ADHD in a high-pressure academic environment,yawaworht867530,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6a34tt/adhd_in_a_highpressure_academic_environment/,"Not sure where else to post this, but I'm having a really hard time in a high-pressure academic environment, and I was wondering if there was anyone who shared my experience or could relate. Throwaway just bc people I know irl know my reddit name.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was about 8 years old, when I started getting C's in third grade because I wasn't doing the work, and I haven't been medicated almost at all because I basically stopped eating during the year that I tried it; that said, it's been a fight for me to succeed with it ever since. I'm fortunate enough to be an intelligent person, because my ADHD related executive functioning issues are so severe that I wouldn't be able to do much of anything if I weren't. 

The problem was that educators and authority figures since elementary school have delegitimized my ADHD as a personal or moral failing. I've been told dozens upon dozens of times that I was ""too smart"" to be making these kinds of mistakes: not turning in completed work, remembering to do basic assignments, I'm sure you're all familiar. A few of my teachers in middle school actually specifically prevented me from getting accommodations because they thought that I was just trying to take advantage of the system to abet my own laziness. I was constantly told my grades were ""too good"" for me to have ADHD, that someone getting mostly A's and B's couldn't possibly have ADHD impact their life or their educational experience. 

I truly hope that none of this comes across as self-serving because that's not how I mean it at all. I've been in relatively high-pressure academic environments since 4th grade, and it's been horrible to my emotional and mental well-being with respect to ADHD. I was constantly told that I was just being undisciplined and lazy, sometimes very publicly berated in front of classes of my peers for doing things like forgetting to finish the back sides of lab reports or not turning in assignments. As a consequence, I truly started to believe that maybe I didn't have ADHD, that despite the many repeated diagnoses I really was just using it to rationalize my naturally lazy tendencies, which is obviously not that great for someone's self esteem and emotional health. 

I thought these issues would resolve as I progressed to higher levels of education, and to some extent they have, but not all that much. Despite having legally guaranteed accommodations at my university, I'm constantly being denied accommodations, ""bargained"" or ""dealt"" with by professors who think my having accommodations is unfair to other students, and having to tiptoe around these authority figures because I don't want to be construed as uppity or presumptuous with respect to my disability or accommodations.

Now I'm wrapping up my junior year, and I find myself really struggling. Academia is not designed with ADHD students in mind, and the added pressures of negotiating internships, rent payments, and meal preparation have really stretched me to my limit. Plus, as hard as it can be to talk about and find support with ADHD and ADHD related issues, I feel like being in an academically elite environment is even more isolating; there seem to be even fewer students with academic disabilities at the top level here (not surprisingly), and I just am struggling not only with keeping everything together, but with the idea that not a lot of people can even understand the degree to which this is difficult for me, and has been difficult for me for so long. I also struggle on and off with severe but fairly functional depression, which I have under control right now but can really mess things up for me if it manifests more. I'm also looking into medication again; best I got right now is a coffee addiction, but that's not exactly Surgeon General Recommends material.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling little personal essay. I'm just truly coming to terms for the first time with the severity of my ADHD and how it affects my life, and I needed to talk about it somewhere with people who could understand. I have many lovely and supportive people in my life who do their best to understand, but almost everyone I know and love is as far away from having ADHD as you could imagine, so their understanding is inherently a little limited.

TL;DR: Being in high-pressure academic environments my whole life has kind of fucked me up with respect to my ADHD and self-perception, and it continues to be a constant struggle that I feel is only getting worse and more difficult as time goes on. If anyone else has any kind of similar experiences, I would love to hear about it. The hardest part is just feeling so alone in this. "

An $emp of $client was having issues with Lync or Skype for Business, whatever you want to call it. She was quite busy at the time, so we agreed to do a reinstall at 8 sharp on Tuesday. 

8 sharp. We're there, or at least she is as I'm groggy as fuck. We check that the problem is still on (activation failed despite owning the licence, creds were correct) and I start to remove Office. Because Lync comes with Office and you can't remove individual programs, right? 

While the uninstall was on, I made her log in to the Office portal so I could download the re-install package. But she doesn't have it? Only thing she has a license for is Lync. So I called up a coworker. 

$me: Hey can you check from the admin panel that $emp has a license to Office? 

$cow: Nah, she uses 2010. Anyway, Skype is installed seperately, you can just remove that. 

oh fuckkkk

$me:... oh. Well you see I already uhhh.. 

Time to go pick up the install CD. Cue 50 min of re-installing Office and like 5min for Lync. Now Lync works. Office doesn't, there are like five keys on the CD just for $client. 

Finally it registers one. But now Outlook doesn't log in. $emp goes to a meeting and I start to google and contemplate changing careers. I find that the problem is most likely that the CD install is outdated and wont work with O365. 

I tried to download SP2 for it but it refused to install. So I started up Windows Update. That was like 30 minutes ago. I'm still here writing this shit and it's been 97% ready for install for like years now. 

We bill $client by time, and no matter how I stretch it, I've just cost them about 1,5 hours extra. So far. 

Luckily I have a ""training"" ticket that is non-billable. I just have to figure out what I've been learning for these 90 minutes that I shouldn't have already known.

I had never been in a fight in my life, which is what made my body surprise me so much. I manage to sidestep my dad’s charge and place a hand on his back, shoving him into the wall of the building behind me. He manages to turn sideways a bit and save his face, but he still hits the wall with a loud smack. He turns back to face me and I can see the anger in his eyes. I turn towards the alley exit and take off at a full sprint again, hoping to put distance between us. It may seem cowardly to some of you, but my body was running on what felt like autopilot and apparently it thought that was the best option. I had never seen my dad run before so I had no idea how fast he could run. I check over my should and see that he’s not too far behind me, gaining only a little at a time. I face forward again and give my body an extra push to run faster.

I don’t really know where I’m running to until I realize that I’ve made it to the front of my dorm. Dorms on-campus have electronic locks that keep anyone who doesn’t have a fob out. I begin to feel some hope again, until I reach into my pocket and realize my keys are gone. For the second time that night, I find myself wishing my roommate was there. My heart feels like it drops all the way down to my stomach. I look behind me, expecting my dad to grab me from behind. To my surprise, he’s nowhere in sight.

I look around a couple times to be sure, but I never catch even a glimpse of him. At that moment, another guy from the dorm opens the door to leave and I dash in. I hurriedly walk to my room. “I should tell someone,” I think to myself. “But what if you only imagined it, Erich? What if this is all just a really bad dream or something?” I make it to my room and am happily surprised to find my door is unlocked. I open it door and step into the dark room, breathing a sigh of relief. I close the door behind me, locking it and switch on the light. As I turn around from the door, my eyes widen in horror and my stomach twists into an inconceivable loop. Standing against the far wall in my room is my dad, staring directly at me. In his hand are my keys.

I immediately fumble for the doorknob unlocking it, but he swoops across the room and grabs me from behind before I manage to open the door. He slams me down on the floor on my back and stands bent over me. “Nice try, kiddo,” he says with a slight rasp. He backs up to the door, keeping an eye on me the whole time. He reaches behind him and locks the door again.

In the split second that I have before he steps back to me from the door, a million thoughts race through my head. “This is just a dream,” loops through my head. For some reason, I am convinced it is a dream. All of sudden, an idea pops into my head. In dreams, people can take control, right? They can make the dream turn out how they want to, they just have to realize they have that power. It was at the exact moment my dad reached my body again that I decide, “I’m taking control of this dream.”

I bring my foot up quicker than even I thought I could, slamming it deep into my dad’s stomach and knocking him backwards. As he staggers, I get back up to my feet. He recovers quickly and charges me again. I sidestep again, keeping my leg out to trip him but he avoids it. He swings at me wildly but I duck and his knuckles slam into my lofted bed frame instead. I drive my fist into the same area I kicked and quickly follow up with a punch to the side of his face. This dream seems to finally be going my way. I continue swinging, a punch here or there getting blocked but many of them hitting their mark. It was hard to tell who was more surprised, him or me. I finally sweep his legs out from under him with a kick and he topples to the floor. Unable to control myself, I kneel down on top of him and begin driving my fists into his face.

He manages to block the first few, but more and more begin to make it through and his face begins to turn bloody under my knuckles. I shout, “This is my dream, you fucking dick,” over and over again, with a punch in between every word. I don’t stop when he stops squirming. I don’t stop when he stops blocking. I don’t stop when his nose squirts blood on me. I don’t stop when I feel his jaw crack. I don’t even stop when I feel my knuckles begin to crack from the trauma. In fact, I never stop, not willingly anyways.

My next door neighbors had heard the commotion and reported it to an RA on the floor. Apparently the RA had come in the room and shouted for me to stop as I sat on top of my father beating the shit out of him, but I never heard. The RA then ran to call 911 as people gathered into the hallway, looking into my room. About 5 minutes after he had initially come into the room, the RA came back to see me still swinging and shouting. He tackled me off of my dad and held me tightly as I resisted and continued swinging.

After a couple more minutes, I stopped resisting and shouting. I just feel deathly silent. The police arrived and were clearing everything up as my RA escorted me from the room. I was shaking violently from all that had happened while my RA gave me some water to drink and talked to me about the police needing to speak to me. I spoke to them and explained what happened. They escorted me to the station a few blocks away so I could give them more concrete answers. I told them everything, my childhood, the first time my dad sexually molested me, that it had carried on until my parents separated, the phone call I had with my mom, and all of the incidents of tonight. They were alarmed, asking me why I’d never come forward before, but I didn’t have an answer for them. One officer was assigned to put me in a holding cell for the night, since my dorm room was a crime scene.

The next morning, I woke up in the cell with an officer sitting directly outside. “What’s going to happen?” I ask. He tells ,e there will more than likely be a court case and hearing, but then reassured me everything would work out and be fine now. “Am I going to have to see my dad?” I ask him. His eyes immediately become filled with worry and sadness. “Son, your father…he’s dead.”

Honestly, the rest of the semester was a blur. I made it back to campus, moved to a different dorm. My old roommate and I still hang out weekly and things are actually going pretty well now. I have a girlfriend, am doing well in all of my classes, and even have an amazing internship opportunity lined up. Everything is going spectacularly. So why do I still feel terrified inside most of the time? 

Constant knots in my stomach, snapping awake in cold sweats, no longer being able to sleep, headaches, paranoia, everything. I couldn’t figure it out for the longest time, but since I’ve started sharing my story with the rest of you who, like me, can longer fall asleep because of the horrors that lurk in your mind, I’ve discovered why I’m still so afraid: when I was sitting on top of my dad, pounding his face in repeatedly, shouting at him, I didn’t want it to be a dream. I’m no longer afraid of the monster my dad was. Now I’m afraid of the monster he made me.

This summer I have an internship as an IT Process and Quality Assurance Analyst at a Fortune 500 company, and if possible I would like to stay with this company after I graduate, if they offer. There's only one issue...

Most of the careers at said company require a firm understanding of SQL, as do most other business analyst or just analyst jobs in general. Originally, I just wanted to take a course at my university but the only course they offer that somewhat teaches SQL is a graduate level database structure class that I can't take (on a side note, from what people say, you really don't learn SQL anyways). 

I have been looking online and it seems CodeAcademy has a few courses that could help me learn SQL, but on the other hand I have heard a few negatives about CodeAcademy, one being that it doesn't really teach you the logic behind languages. Since SQL is a database language, will I be fine using CodeAcademy? Or is there any other site that someone recommends to learn and gain an understanding of SQL?

The first school kids attend is 6 year primary school where they get basic education in math, polish, science subjects and art subjects. Afterwards they continue the same program but with a bit more advanced topics in 3 year junior high school. Later they must continue education in the school of their choice: 

- 2 year vocational school where they learn profession, 

- 4 year technikum (sort of technical school) where they get technician title and they may also pass matura (final exams), after passing matura, people are able to apply to universities

- 3 year high school where people only pass matura in one of many specializations (there are 3 main: mathematics-physics profile, humanistic profile and biology-chemistry profile), people are able to apply to universities

It's up to us which school we choose, we only have to satisfy the requirements of the school we choose. 

Edit end

The first year of IB is about to end soon but I've been feeling bad about taking this course. 

I have really bad teachers who can't teach. In fact, most of them don't even speak English well. Due to that, lessons are in Polish instead of English. 

I have nothing against literature, I can read it. I started hating it because I'm forced to look in those texts for weird things I don't even see. I hate doing presentations about things I know barely anything about, writing all those essays, Internal Assessments, Extended Essay and CAS documents. I'm not a writer, I have no idea how to write 1,200 words about a thing which I could summarise in 300 words. I'm a programmer and mathematician. I love writing code, developing games, solving algorithmic problems, doing webdev stuff, learning math and solving math problems. Those are the things I would like to focus on and do in my future. 

Although IB claims it provides enormous possibilities for personal development, I actually get no support in developing myself in the areas I love. Also, my school has a very limited choice of subjects (English (HL only), Polish (SL at least), Geo, History, Bio, Chemisty, Physics, Math (SL at least) and German), so I was forced to take English HL, Polish SL, History SL, Physics HL, Math HL and German SL. There was no way to choose Further Mathematics HL or Computer Science. I just hate this school and IB. 

That's why I started thinking about changing school, but I'm not sure whether I really should do that. I would choose one of the top IT high schools in Poland where I could actually learn something, but people keep talking about prestige IB gives. I don't want to go to uni, instead I want to go to work and get more experience (I've already had an internship). Do I need IB and its 'prestige'? Any advices what I should do?"

Hello! I'm currently finishing my last week of my junior year in the computer engineering curriculum. I'm struggling to lock down an internship for this summer and I've been applying since early February. A few key points I think that should be on my resume but i'm not sure of how to word them/if they should be placed on in the first place are:

Some discrepancies you may notice is that I started college in 2013 and wont graduate until 2018, I switched majors my sophomore year and due to the strict progression of Computer Engineering courses, I lost a year. This is also part of the reason I chose to do the accelerated masters program. A masters degree in 6 years looks much better than a bachelors in 5.  

-I was admitted to, and intend on completing, a 4+1 Master's program at my university. I take my first graduate level course next semester but am not ""officially"" in the program until after I apply my senior year. Not sure how to convey this on my resume or if i even should at this point in my curriculum
-I recently completed two large group projects for my classes, one was fully developing and implementing the Ethernet MAC Protocol on a Xilinx FPGA board 
-The other project was an Arduino Based metal detecting rover that had to traverse a 6ft x 6ft maze with obstacles and detect 4 metal mines while keeping track of distance traveled as well as mines found"

Background: I have been working as a software developer professionally (as an intern) for about a year. Now I came to this role through a slightly unorthodox path. I originally worked in sales for about 5 years before deciding it was time for a change, and quit sales and began taking CS courses at a local community college. Now for the relevant courses I have taken are: 

Maths - Calculus and Discrete 

Computer Science - Intro to CS, Object Oriented, Logic Circuits, and CSC 240 (C, C++, Scheme and Prolog).
 
Now I was fortunate enough to work this internship into a full time role as a developer. However, i still want to continue expanding my computer science knowledge to help me advance quickly through the field. 

So my question is this: of the classes/skills i never learned by going a traditional CS, what is going to be the most valuable in me learning in my ""free"" time. Now I know the most important things are skills like problem solving, debugging, etc, but what I'm curious is what classes/fundamentals should I focus on picking up in my spare time? Things like data structures and algorithms or something else? Interested in feedback from people who are at least a few years removed from school, and have seen their education in action.

I went to class everyday, attended all the lectures, took notes and paid attention. I got a C in the second part of my freshman level program after the TA lost my semester project. I got a D in Microeconomics despite going to class everyday. However, it was the third semester that did the most damage. I barely passed business statistics and astronomy. My astronomy professor was the worst. He would ask questions that were never covered in the lectures, textbook, or even in the labs. That semester I kept getting 60s on tests despite going to class everyday and doing the right things. I began to fall into depression. I felt like quitting college until my mom stopped me in my tracks. However when I told my parents what was going on surprisingly they did not flip out at me when I showed the my unofficial transcript and advising report. We worked out a plan. The following semester , I retook Microeconomics and Business Statistics and got B- in both of them. However my GPA moved up to 3.08. I also didn't know that I had to take an English class and a Speech class to get into my major. In fact, I didn't know that I was supposed to be accepted into the college of business. How stupid am I. But I used my ignorance and turned it into an opportunity. I ended up taking 6 summer classes to make up the credit and to fulfill the requirements to get into the college of business and to retake the astronomy class that I barely passed. I got 5 A's and an A- on my retake. The writing and speaking classes replaced the two classes from the freshman program. My GPA skyrocketed to a 3.53 and it was all uphill from there. I made the deans list four times out of the next five semesters. I was also able to get an internship at a Fortune 500 company in my hometown the summer after my third year. I was also able to get two other internships at a mid size regional accounting firm and a Big 4 firm. I received an offer from the Big 4 Firm just a couple of weeks ago. I'm going into my final year of college with a semester left in the program. I will be graduating in December after 5.5 long years and will sit for the CPA exam next Spring. I wanna thank my parents for giving me this opportunity and supporting me through thick and thin. I also wanna thank them for not pulling the plug or giving up on me when my GPA dropped to only 2.7. Most parents would have threatened to kick their kids out of the house if things came to that. Bottom line: no matter how bad things get there's always hope. Never give up."

My emotional state has gone rapidly downhill the past few weeks which I suspect it's relocation blues and realizing I have no friends and no good hobbies to really meet people. I'll keep going to meetups since that seems like the only choice I have. I also have too much free time due to no longer fighting wars for the best jobs as I did in college. This emotional state has unfortunately creeped into work and I oftentimes just space out. I write code almost mindlessly while I daydream about how I liked New York better as an intern there last summer. But it's pretty delusional since I don't think I was that much happier there at the time (maybe because I had to leave the city after the internship).

6abk1c,0,2017-05-10,The quest to work remotely,conchshells,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6abk1c/the_quest_to_work_remotely/,"tl:dr; If you have internship experience with two top companies and a Github portfolio of work (JavaScript/Java/PHP/Node.js), do you have a chance to get a fully remote software development position as your first full time job if you are fully dedicated?

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and am on track to finish an M.S. I got my B.S. in New York (state), while living with my family. I had an internship with a big company while I was there, I liked the work but not really the company. And I was part of some women in STEM clubs. Then I moved to Boston to get my M.S. I also have a research assistant position here.

My issue is that now that I have moved out (to Boston), I desperately feel homesick and that has only grown and grown in intensity. Nor am I a big fan of the area. I'm alone here and have few friends, went on some dates but I have no connection to most of these people. I also miss my dog and think about him every day, he used to take my stress levels down by A LOT. Landlord won't let me have a dog here. I like my work here in Boston but when I've completed this degree, what I really want to do most is move back home and try my luck with a job there. I am in the city and all the commuting, crowds, noise, etc. all of it is pretty exhausting. And I have sensory issues which doesn't help matters. Another reason I feel I don't fit in is that most of my co-workers are PhDs and are 25 and older. I'm 21. Maybe if I had waited a few years to come here, I'd have fared better, but I didn't want to miss my chance. 

To live at home with my family is the life I want right now (after I get my degree) to make sure my stress levels are at a manageable level for me. It may change in the future, who knows.

Now I know you'll say ""but that's adult life!!1! GET USED TO IT!!"" True enough, and I think I've been doing pretty well so far, I've forced myself to go into work even when I didn't want to because I am dedicated, but, here's my idea. There are companies I think would be great to work for such as Mozilla and WikiMedia, that offer fully remote positions for work from home. I would be excited to work on browser technologies at Mozilla, and I use Wikipedia and its related services every day so it would be amazing to work with them. I even have experience with information science and library science so I could contribute to them as well. 

I have worked from home with my internships at times, set my own hours around my classes, and I preferred that way of working. I always keep Slack/IRC, Github Issues, Skype and of course e-mail open during business hours so someone can always get ahold of me when needed. I definitely don't believe in sequestering yourself in your home and not being available to communicate, obviously remote work would never... work... if you did that. I've read a lot of the articles and blog posts on best practices for remote work too. I do not like being unable to control conditions such as temperature, noise level, and other comfort things in my environment, as in an office. Annoying coworkers are the worst. I would also love the freedom to be able to just go downstairs in my own home and make a sandwich just about whenever I darn feel like it. :) I can't deny the perks or the challenges.

I am dedicated to making a career at one of these companies and am already looking for ways to contribute to their open source projects. That way, I can show contribution before applying. But I am worried because even though I have two great internships (mostly JavaScript, Java and PHP coding, also lots of Linux experience) to show for everything, a lot of their open positions are ""Senior"" positions. I have about 3 years paid experience if you count all my internships, but have never had a full time job. I think if I apply as entry level, they'll want me to relocate to one of their locations, at least to start. I'd strongly consider it and it may well lead to a remote position, but it would be really hard to move away again.

Another thing I'd like to do is work for a company based out of NYC, but I'd like flexibility since my home is 2 hours away, the commute would be tough. It would be great if I could go to the office once a week or twice a month (obviously adjusting to more frequently if we had a huge deadline or something) and work from home the rest of the time. But I can't find many companies that would allow this.

In short, I'm asking if in practice, you can get a fully remote position as an entry level applicant. Obviously if you apply to a fully remote company such as Automattic, you get to work remote by default. I haven't identified a fully remote company that, skill-wise, would be a good fit for my experience though.
 
I am confident I can succeed as a remote worker and it would really be a good situation for me to be able to live with my family (at least for now). But I don't know if it's feasible, even with a great portfolio and relevant work, they may doubt whether an entry level person can handle remote work, remain available when needed, meet deadlines and such. I admit the biggest thing that worries me is being able to separate working hours from ""life"" and being able to disconnect after 5 PM. However, I am dedicated to make this my goal.

Despite the challenges, a lot of my advisors and family have been asking ""well, what do you want to do"" and I've decided I'm dedicated to making my dream job a reality, rather than spend a lot of time trying to force myself to do jobs I don't want to do. I realize part of being an adult is doing stuff you don't want to do, like getting up on a rainy morning at 7am to catch a train, and it's not like self-discipline goes away when you work at home. In fact, you need more of it. Is it possible for me to be hired as a remote worker right away? Or would I have to put in some office time for a few years before they will allow it? Should I try to improve my skills across the board first, does it help? Or are they just looking for proven experience with working from home? I would think that if you contribute to one of their open source projects with no problems, that shows initiative, familiarity with their projects and dedication that you would contribute for no compensation. But if you can do something well, don't work for free if you can help it. Thanks for reading."

I intend to take Computer Science as a major and from what I've searched so far, it is very competitive. So:
1. I am unsure if transfered credit grades would help me in this case or if they would count when regarding a major choice.
2. There are other programs I am interested in: statistics or mathematics for instance. Are these easier to get in? How are job offer for these?
3. I have also an offer from UBC-O (on year 3) which I believe may be easier to take a major, but perhaps would not provide with the same internship or job opportunities as UofT.

Does someone has any thoughts about these questions? Thanks in advance.

The program we work in requires Windows 7 (Win 10 support coming soon), and a very specific system configuration. We usually only work with people who have this particular system, but we're thinking of experimenting with placing a whole virtual machine on an external drive, and sending it to some of our editors - either so they don't have to reconfigure their own machine, or in the case that they don't have a Windows computer.

So I have two questions:
Could they run the VM, and the medium-heavy processor intensive editing program directly from a USB3 drive?

Whether the answer to question 1 is yes or no, what would be the licensing necessities? We'd like to make the process as streamlined and non-invasive as possible. Ideally the editor would receive a drive from us, open a VM on the drive and start working without having to install a program or enter a license key. Of course we would purchase any necessary licenses, but what are the considerations when transferring a VM?

I'd figure that I'm not ready for a real software engineering role yet, but I'm probably at the level expected for interns. I also feel that my skills are growing a lot by taking classes, but there's a lot of things that I won't learn until I'm in a professional environment.


I'll be meeting with the CTO of the startup today, what should I say to him? I feel that my mix of company experience and programming ability makes me a potentially useful commodity within the company, but there's not a role that makes sense for me.
 
If I can't transition into a more technical role within the company I'll probably leave at some point in the next 6 months to focus on my career growth. However, leaving the tech startup I work at to get more tech experience elsewhere seems like a huge missed opportunity.

Graduated community college with AS in Networking, right after that got an internship at a hospital. Internship eventually turn into full time job, however I'm not actually doing network. Mostly fixing things and waiting for people to call and complain about their issues.

I grew playing video games and messing with computers, and quickly found out that having a hobby as career is a double edge sword. You either really love it, or you end up hating your hobby. Now I barely want anything to do with computers. At first I enjoy it because it was an exciting field at the time, however EVERYONE was doing the same and now the market in my area is saturated.

My current job has decent benefits due to us being a hospital. It is 10 minutes away, which is nice. No hard labor. Coworkers are cool and it's easy for the most part. However I'm getting paid below the market value. The hospital is going under and thinking about merging (could be a good chance to move up when the merge happens), I been here for 3 years and I'm the senior member at the helpdesk due to major turnovers. The mental stress is pretty bad due to ludicrous demands that wants to be completed now by doctors, and general users who think they know how a computer works better than I do. When it is not rush hour at the office, it is dead silence and gets boring sometimes.

Single with no kids, however I am finically supporting my mother with rent, food, utilities while she works on her Admin/Accounting degree. She has a part time job, however that company also went through a merge, and not sure if she will keep it or not. So I'm still not comfortable ditching her to support herself (She's only close family member I have.)

I'm not fond of people due to small talk being a waste of time, however I'm not socially awkward and can handle social activities. Just prefer not to. I do enjoy math and creative task. I think with computers, one issue could have 20 solutions, and that is stressful, whereas 2+2=4. With creative aspect, you create something without a lot of rules. I recently found this as I picked up music production in the last couple of years and love it. Eventually I would love to work on my music full time and travel. However I have not got to that point yet. 

I think I would be happy with something that has less computer involved, or at least fixing them. I had a dream recently that I was digging in dirt looking for dinosaur bones to discover missing links of human history. I may enjoy something outside as long as it is not extreme weather or heavy lifting (bad neck/back).

At this point I'm not sure what I would want to do beside music. Just less fixing computers. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I've een strugglign with suicidal thoughts since I was about 17 years old, I'm 22 almost now. I'm going through a breakup right now of three years. I supported my ex-girlfriend through feelings of hopelessness, self-harm and suicide for an entire year - I dropped everything to look after her. When it was my turn, she completely abandoned me and started gossipign me to her friends.

After the breakup, I lost all my friends because she manipualted them. I have told some close friends I feel suicidal, but it'hasn't helped. I'm seeing a psych, but it hasn't helped. I'm doing everything in my power to get help, but it's not helping. I recently told my parents that I've been diagnosed with depression, they have dismissed it and told me that it was all my fault and told me to stop being selfish.

I honestly feel very alone. From an outsider perspective, my life is great - I've got an internship lined up at Ernst &amp; Young, two years of paralegal experience and I'm on my way to finishing law school. On the inside, it's completely different and I feel so hopeless. I realise people don't want to hear tough shit because it's uncomfortable.

I will buy some benzos and down it with alcohol later on tonight (in a couple of hours). I have deactivated my Facebook just so I can't message people incase I try to 'get out of the thing'. I have attempted suicide previously and have told some people, but it appears they haven't taken me seriously. I will actually go this time, nobody will miss me because nobody notices me normally.


I fucking hate my parents and my family. The people that were supposed to be here for me aren't.


Edit: My living situation is shit. I'm living with 5 other guys, all of them are messy as fuck. I usually do all the cleaning. 4 of them knew each other before they moved in, and they all bitch about me. One of them had the nerves to tell me that ""you're fucking weird, you're the reason that we never have people over at our place anymore, because you make all our friends uncomfortable"". They also know of my self-harm - two months ago, I accidently left some bloody tissues in the bathroom. One of them came up to me and said 'clean that shit up, you're absolutely disgusting'

I went from being a biology student, hated it, and taught myself code in one summer, then switched to Computer Engineering and just got to work. I was tired of being denied because I didn't have CS classes on my transcript. I had an onsite but I was still having trouble with syntax at the time.
So instead of being bummed out, this school year I completed several projects, one is international, another one I'm in the middle of leveraging between two companies who are interested in buying it.

 In the interview, she thanked me for sending her such a well-written and professional cover letter that showed I'm serious about this position. The internship went really well and she told me I was the second out of 7 people she had lined up to be interviewed for the program. She high-fived me like 4 times and complimented me on my credentials and even introduced me to everyone in the office. I walked away REALLY happy. 2 days after the interview I sent a thank you email (I know, should have been that day but I received a call about a huge family emergency and had to immediately catch a Red Eye and get to Europe). 

As I was leaving and saying goodbye and laughing it up with her, she told me, ""I'll let you know next week about our decision! Bye thank you!"" It's now been a little over a week since the interview happened and I haven't heard back.

I'm starting to feel a little defeated, but not sure if I'm just anxious and over-reacting. Should it have been a hand-written Thank You note? Does sending one out 2 days after an Interview v.s. sending on that same day make a HUGE difference? I feel like I got ghosted by someone after going on an amazing date :(  "

6ai77v,690,2017-05-11,Noodling at the Morgue.,indianorphan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ai77v/noodling_at_the_morgue/,"It was my last year of Mortuary School and I had one last internship before becoming a Mortuary Assistant. Because I worked in a small country town, there were only 2 assistant positions open at the morgue. I wanted the job, so I worked all the extra night shifts to impress the powers that be.  That is how I ended up taking care of  my  brother's girlfriend. 

She was alive, when I got off of my shift that morning. I knew she was in bad shape, though. I had prayed she would make it out of the  ICU isolation room. She was beautiful, smart, young and the love of my brother's life. And I worried about my brother's mental state if she didn't make it. Especially since, he felt like he was directly responsible for her condition.

 In our town, the local river was a hot spot for noodling. Noodling is a way to catch catfish, by hand. The young men loved to get the hot women out into chest high water. They loved to stand behind them and help them reach deep into the cold water and wait for a catfish to chomp up their arm. And my brother had convinced his girlfriend, Cara, to try it out. And Cara, dressed for the occasion. A tight white t shirt, white shorty shorts and lacy underwear.

 My brother confided in me that he was distracted with thoughts of getting her out of her wet clothes and that is why he didn't notice the blooded puncture until the next day. 

 
The next morning after their night of noodling, he had trouble waking her up. She was on fire and the dot of blood had turned into a softball size engorged lump, the color of coal. 

The doctors asked all kinds of questions, after he rushed her into the county emergency room, ""Did anyone see the fish? Did it look deformed in anyway? Are you sure it was a catfish that stuck her? Did anyone else get stuck?""

My brother couldn't answer the doctors, because he never saw the fish. As a matter of fact, they never noodled a single catfish the whole day. But I reassured him, that she would be fine. That she just needed some iv antibiotics. I told him, that he had moved fast in giving her the correct care, and that she would be home kissing him by the end of the week.

 I mean our little river was a place to have fun and cool off, but it was dirty. I personally stopped swimming in it, after the government finished digging up the area for the pipeline. But no one else seemed bothered by the intensified fishy smell or the new greenish hue that glittered in the evening sky.

I reassured him she would be ok, 24 hours ago. Tonight I am reassuring him that I would care for her body the best I could. The whole hospital was in shock by her gruesome death and the hospital director wanted her body out of his hospital. 

The Coroner explained to me, that we were to take isolation precautions and that the CDC was sending one of their own to assist us in the autopsy. On the way to collect Cara, the doctor filled me in on the timeline of her death. 

He told me that when she was brought in, the spot had covered her entire arm and was as if her skin had  huge blisters, the size of balloons all over her arm. The nurse that saw her first, touched the arm and greenish stinky mucous exploded all over Cara's lap. 

By the time they got her in her room, her legs were covered in the black blisters. The blisters swelled bigger and larger. He informed me that the blisters were 3 skin layers deep and that the skin was  stretched thinner and thinner until it burst. The explosion would split the skin all the way down to the muscles and veins underneath. 

The blood would then gush out of the wounds, and what skin was left would stick to the sheets and start blistering and splitting over and over again. I tried to gain courage to handle the sight of her body. But I wasn't prepared. Nothing could have ever prepared me for what was on that bed. 

She was completely skinless. There was not a single cell of skin left anywhere on her body. Her eyeballs had fallen out of their sockets and her hair was gone. I think it would have been better if she was just  skeleton. But there was just enough of her muscles to still give the appearance of the woman she once was.  

I don't know how we managed to get her into the body bag, but we did. Neither the doctor or myself spoke while taking her to the room to prep her for some sort of autopsy. I would have vomited if I opened my mouth and I knew I would never ever open my mouth and speak of her appearance to anyone ever.

My job at that point was to stay and monitor the body bag while the coroner took a break and picked up the cdc agent at the airport. I was nervous, I just felt something was very wrong and I truly didn't want to be left alone with her but I wanted this good paying job. I needed the job and I could not let my feelings or my fear keep me from doing it. I needed to be tough. I was going to have to get used to being alone with the dead.

It wasn't long until my eyes started to droop. I was emotionally exhausted and very worried about my brother. I needed some coffee to stay awake during this long night. I looked at the body bag and decided I was going to get coffee. I got out of my gear and went into the kichenette and made some. 

And that is when I heard her voice calling out for help. Even as I write this today, I remember the fear I felt in that moment. It was so intense that it gripped my heart and paused it's beating. I can't say how I managed to make my feet move back towards the cold morgue...but I did. What I saw  has left large permanent goosebumps over my entire body today.

I peered through the window of the door and saw the black body bag sitting upright on the table. And it was if I was ten again, and every scary unknown creature from the movies, was peering at me through the haze of the bag. 

I dropped my coffee cup and the noise seemed to waken Cara and she screamed my name, loud and clear. Her voice did something to me, it panicked me. I had worked so hard in school to know the difference between a dead body and a live body but somehow, somehow I messed up. Hell, even the coroner messed up. She was alive and needed help.

I didn't put my protection gear back on, I just ran to her. I reached for her and for a moment hesitated, not sure what part of her to touch. I screamed back at her, ""Cara, Cara, it's going to be ok. Just let me help you. I am so sorry, just let me help you lie back on the table. I ..I.. I need to help your head so you don't hit your skull and expose more of your brain.""

She stopped screaming and seemed to nod her head yes at me. So I gently grabbed the back of her head and moved her slowly back towards the table.  When I had her lying down I gave her step by step instructions on what I intended to do to help her. I explained to her that I was going to have to unzip the body bag and that I would try not to poke my nails into her as I did this.

The zipper seemed stuck and I was worried but Cara seemed better, heck she was even talking to me, "" I was worried today. I mean I thought I was going to die, you know! But I didn't and I feel fantastic. As a matter of fact I feel stronger than ever. I can see your tears and I want you to know...it's ok! You didn't do anything wrong."" 

I don't know how she knew I was crying or even how she knew what I was thinking, but her words calmed me and I was able to get the bag unzipped a little. "" I think it's stuck Cara, can you move at all. Just a little to the right, maybe that will help me get this unzipped.'

Cara sighed,"" I can't! It hurts to bad, I think it's stuck on the fabric inside here. Just slowly put your hand inside and feel for the zipper right near my neck.""

I wasn't sure if this was a good idea, but her whimpers spurned me onward and I slipped my hand down into the black bag. "" That's it, just a little lower and you should be able to feel the fabric. "" She whispered. 

I didn't realize that I had my elbow deep in the bag until I felt a wetness reach past it. It was a such a shock that I tried to pull my arm back but it was stuck, on something sharp. I jerked with all my might and finally I was free. And then Cara laughed. A hard laugh. As if it came from the mouth of a bully who had just taken my lunch money. 

I just stood there, looking at the tiny puncture wounds on my arm. Her laughter seemed to freeze me in place, even while Cara stuck a scaly claw of fingers through the hole and began to unzip the zipper.

I was frozen as she leaped from the bag, in all of her new glory. She seemed to undulate from beauty to beast, as she stretched her self to over 7 feet tall. She jumped from the table to the ceiling and hung upside down in front of me. It was when she pulled her green smelly hair away from her face and smiled at me, through  what appeared to be a wide toothless grin, that I screamed.

She laughed, "" thanks for helping me. Thanks for caring for me. I have given you a gift, in return. One day, you will walk along side of me and my skin shifters without passing judgements.""

She seemed to squish herself through the crack on the window and disappear into the dark Dakota night. I ran home and poured bleach on my open wounds. It hurt but I think my skin doesn't smell like river anymore.  And I am sure that the blisters are from the bleach. I swear, they just have to be from the bleach."

A short bio about me: I'm doing a bachelor in econometrics (2nd years). I'm fascinated about data science but I don't really have an idea on where to start or how to implement it in real life. I'm reading books about machine learning in R and python, which give me some insight.

Now, I got my first summer internship at a insurance brokerage to help them implement data analytics. The thing Is I have no one there to mentor me, since I'm the only one there with some knowledge of it.

I think there is a lot of potential at this firm, since they don't use any data analysis yet. I've researched some interesting projects to start with, but I don't know if I will be capable of doing it:

- identify new customers
- understanding customer needs
- product development 
- risk selection / pricing
- marketing
- insurer selection 

I don't know to what extend you guys can help me but all tips or experiences are welcome! 

Do some of you work as a data analyst at a insurance brokerage? What could be a good project to start with? Are there any readings that could give me some guidelines or further knowledge?

Thanks in advance!"

6ajcuy,12,2017-05-11,"First year, just hired, instant anxiety. Overthinking? Help 😬",Dfg_w56,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/6ajcuy/first_year_just_hired_instant_anxiety/,"Hello! First time posting, but this subreddit has been a great source of advice and reminders over the past few weeks. I have a few specific questions but would also appreciate any advice that anyone feels like sharing. So, some lengthy (I prefer ""thorough"") background:

Male, White, 21, from NC, now in central Florida.

Graduating May 13th from a small private university with a BA in Spanish. Minors in Latin American Studies, Education, and French. 

Solid résumé displaying mastery in my field as a non-native speaker as well as a senior thesis on the late work of Pablo Neruda, showing research and cultural/literary competency. Participation in the local Latinx community including working with a professor to form a free-of-charge adult ESOL program on campus as well as free child care facilitated by student interns. Several ""teaching"" experiences in elementary ESOL programs, high school Spanish courses (1 - AP), work as a TA for a Latino Studies course, and a handful of shorter interactions as a result of my minor in Education. 

I attended a district job fair in April and interviewed with about 10 schools, three of which with actual vacancies. I received ""recommendations"" from most of the interviewers that the county uses (to my understanding) to ""rank"" applicants in their system. So, as it was explained to me, when a principal pulls up the applicant database and searches for an applicant for Spanish, my name would be at/near the top of the list thanks to other administrators having given me a ""thumbs up"". 

Before I heard from any of the schools I actually interviewed with, I got an email (Friday the 5th) from a principal at a high school in the same town as my university (not really relevant as I already own a home in a neighboring city and am used to the commute by now lol). Typical intro email asking if I was still in search of a job. I replied that I was, thank you, asked when/how we could speak. He's available to call right now; great! We speak on the phone for about half an hour, basically an overview of my résumé and a few personality probes (Why did you choose your university?, Do you have any concerns about your experiences fitting?, etc.) A very nice chat and he seemed impressed; great! 

He asked if I was able to come in for an interview on Tuesday the 9th, and I did. It was with him and two Spanish speakers: the head of the modern languages department and an assistant principal. Standard interview...my first time doing one bilingually, but no difference in confidence or anything like that. I was getting very compatible vibes and a general feeling of ""we like you"" from them all and apparently I was correct in assuming that because I was offered the position. Great! I formally get hired in June after the county approves the vacancy and the position is ""posted"", but I confirmed (and the principal expressed) multiple times that it was solid.

I had sent in my transcript to the FLDOE a few weeks ago for my courses to be reviewed so that I could be confirmed ""eligible for certification"" and have 0 doubt that there will be any problem, so that's taken care of. I had also already paid for and scheduled my FTCE Spanish K-12 exam for yesterday (the 10th) and took it in the morning. As with the eligibility, I have very little doubt that I did not pass. The results of the FTCE come back in about 6 weeks, but even if I didn't pass (again, I'm sure I did fine), I would have the temporary certification from my coursework for a year. All of this confirmed by the school and the county lol.So, everything is going smoothly and is in motion. 

But, having left behind the anxiety of ""Am I going to get a job after I graduate???"", I now feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.

I am passionate and skilled in my field with many experiences to confirm to myself that, yes, I actually know something. I fell in love with education and working with kids after interacting with elementary ESOL students and the following semester took my first real education course that focused on curriculum and lesson planning. I loved that, and was urged by that professor to pursue a minor. I've taken, enjoyed, and excelled in all of the Education courses required by the minor (I would have taken more, but the Ed. Department was difficult to ""infiltrate"" if you're not an Ed. Major). I'm confident that I have learned enough, know enough, and am capable enough to provide an interesting, warm, and challenging class to my students while also handling classroom management. 

But I still feel as though I am going in blind. I've gathered that in June, after the hiring process is finalized, there is an orientation process, but all available sources online don't specify anything more than ""a length of at least 2.5 hours"". I'm not sure if it's an orientation presented by the county or by the exact school.

 I do know that the school pairs first-year teachers with veteran teachers from the same department the week before classes begin and that that mentorship continues throughout the year with quarterly reviews, advice, observations, etc. The curriculum maps are available online, I know the content, and I have access (the same as anyone who visits the school website) to a few syllabi from current Spanish teachers at the same school. Obviously not to copy exactly what they have planned, but to get context for what is expected as far as pace, rigor, etc. I have a lot of experiences and intend to find everything I can use to supplement each unit with interesting content that might be a little more relevant/provoking for students than pure from-the-book examples. 

So. I suppose my questions are:

What have been your experiences with orientations over the summer?

Does the principal/someone from the school usually reach out over the summer? 

Has anyone else taught HS Spanish in Florida? Anything exceedingly crazy about it?

Has anyone else not majored in Education and gone straight into the classroom with minimal """"""real"""""" experience?

Am I overthinking or overreacting? 

Also, maybe a less paranoid question: What has been your experience as a young teacher? I've read a lot on here and feel I have enough common sense/tact/humor for it to not be a big deal, but would welcome any stories/tips you feel inclined to share. 



I guess I am just imagining a (probably crazy) scenario where I complete all of the paperwork, get everything done, and never hear from anyone until the week before school starts. I honestly think that I know that that's probably unlikely, but I just wanted to hear the experiences that others have had. 

Thanks for any advice available. Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to add as much background as possible so that it didn't seem like I'd decided on a whim to apply for a teaching job, gotten it, and was now freaking out. It's my passion, honestly the only job I could see myself doing and enjoying, and I (up until it actually becoming a definite reality) have always had such an excitement and confidence in being able to do it well. Not to say that those hopes have disappeared, just clarifying that I know that I am probably just overreacting/overthinking. (I hope, haha)

TL;DR:
- Spanish major
- Passion for education
- Background and evidence of skill in both fields

- Got hired to teach HS

- Instant anxiety of failure and worry of not having enough experience

- Worried there will be no contact/help/intro over the summer

- Probably irrational, just wanted advice

- Questions at end

This is for a more infrastructure/production engr. roll by title, yet my manager is SWE and the work will be a fair amount of SWE and analytics. There'll be a significant machine learning aspect for some analytics because I expressed interest.

So let's say I get a full-time offer, but I can see myself wanting to do pure SWE, ML/ data science work, or work with spec. projects down the line. The production engr. position is of course still interesting and all.

Am I better off staying put and just try and do a good job/ do side projects with other teams (which is encouraged) or jump ship to a smaller company to do specifically SWE, etc.? 
I've heard a lot of ""companies want to keep smart people and accommodate to changing interests."" On top of that, Google, FB, among other companies are doing ML/AI internal transfer programs these days so that's something to keep in mind.

I really excelled in the classes that involved political ideas, theory, and history, and my professors are encouraging me to enroll in a PhD program for Political Science. While the deadlines have passed for enrollment in one this coming fall, I will need to be weighing my options for the Fall 2018 semester. 
Though it is probably unnecessary to include my entire resume, I'm wondering if you all have any idea whether I'd be in shape to get into some of my top choices, such as Duke, Notre Dame, maybe even Harvard. 

*Undergraduate GPA = 3.73 
This was a disappointing GPA to me. I was a straight A student in my last two years of college as I got into the meat of my degree and improved as a writer / researcher, but the Bs that I got early on stayed with me. Regrettably, I did not make Latin Honors because my University had what was in my view an obscenely high requirement for the minimum cum laude, at 3.85.

*My big senior thesis project was very successful. It won first place in Regent University's Annual Student-Faculty Research Conference, and the paper was presented at Virginia Commonwealth University to positive feedback. I am currently working to get it published in a reputable journal of American political thought. 

*Three political internships, two of which were in the D.C. area, one was a campaign job during the 2016 cycle. 

*At my alma mater, I worked as a Writing Tutor in the Academic Support Center. 

*I was the president of my school's chapter of the National Political Science Honors Society (Pi Sigma Alpha)

*Lastly, I made a very strong impact on my Government professors and I am certain that they will write me powerful Letters of Recommendation.

Do you all think that I have a  chance of admittance to places like Duke, Notre Dame, or Ivy Leagues? "
6ale0q,3,2017-05-11,[Advice] I graduated from college six months ago and still haven't found a job. I'm thinking about going through a staffing/employment agency and need advice on how to do that.,forbesms,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6ale0q/advice_i_graduated_from_college_six_months_ago/,"I graduated back in December with my BSBA in Computer Information Systems and Supply Chain Management with a 3.40 overall GPA, two internships, and several other qualifications. Despite this, I have had zero offers for jobs. I've had many interviews, several of which I made it to the final round of interviewing for, but was ultimately rejected for some reason. Lately I've been networking more with people in the industries I'm interested in going into, but nothing has come of it yet.

Recently a friend recommended that I look into getting a job through a recruiting agency, that it's how he found his job in the Supply Chain industry and the quickest way to find one. Right now I'm very interested in going this route, as nothing else has worked out for me. However, I have questions about how to do this.

First of all, I do not want to live where I currently live in the small town I grew up in (I've been driving 4-6 hours, both ways, to the closest big cities for the job interviews that I have had). Do I have to go to a different staffing agency in each city to get a job there? I'm really confused as to how the process goes. I've looked at a few staffing agency websites, and the ones I've registered for don't look any different from Indeed or Glassdoor, just making an account, uploading a resume and applying for jobs, which I've been doing for the last nine months or so. How do I utilize these services to my advantage? Does my living several hours away make me a less appealing candidate? If so, how can I get a company to hire an entry level employee who wants to work there and live in that city? I don't mind paying my own relocation costs, I just don't want to move someplace without a job and ruin my credit or go bankrupt.

Secondly, do you all have any general advice on going through a staffing agency and making the most of it? I have no idea what I'm doing."

EDIT: I'm asking mainly because all internships I apply for ask for GPA above 3.0 which I don't have but if anybody were to test my knowledge on data structures, web design, OOP, etc. I'd be able to prove myself."

We got into a fight because I am paying for rent this summer and I want some place close to my investment banking summer internship in chicago so I dont have to take a 40 minute train. Knowing me I will uber from there because I am always running late (something i want to change). She told me that I need to find a cheap place that is far away and that I need to save my money. Then she makes me feel like shit saying that I was crazy because I spent my money all last summer. I honestly feel terrible about myself. TERRIBLE. And i hate how she compares me to my sister, I want to change. I want to be motivated and have energy but its so damn hard. 
i want to be able to save my money, but I like going out to eat with friends, and enjoying my time in the city for the summer. 
I don't know what to do, but I would really appreciate some books, resources, encouragement or someone to talk to because I feel like no one understands and I also don't know what to do. I want an action plan, I just need resources and help "

I took two comp sci classes which were Java1 and Java2 basically. I still can graduate on time if I really crunch my credits but I'm not too worried about that now. 

I applied for 10 summer jobs/internships that range from IT support desk to software engineering intern. I have not heard back from many of the them, and the ones I do hear back from are all declined. I went through network connections I had, school career center, and online job sites.

I've tried really hard this year, and I feel like none of it paid off. 

I'm thinking it's my gpa, I'm sitting at a 2.95, calc1-2, Chem 1-2, and some other classes were tough at times.

6amh1a,6,2017-05-11,Reposted Chances,Laptop_Looking,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6amh1a/reposted_chances/,"Sorry for the repost, I messed up my post earlier, here it is updated:



It seems like a lot of people have been doing reverse chances, so I thought I would join the group.


Grades/Tests: 

* 3.92 UW/4.62 W (school does not rank)

* SAT: 1590

* ACT: 35

* PSAT: 1490 (looking at National Merit Schools)

* SAT II: 800 Chemistry (taking Math II and Biology this year)

* AP: Three taken so far, all fives. I'm taking five this year


EC:

* Scholastic Bowl Varsity

* Varsity Rowing (not good enough to do D1 or anything like that in college, but will do club rowing if available)

* Assistant Coach for Middle School scholastic bowl team (120 volunteer hours)

* In a competitive two-year program for high school students at a nearby hospital, basically meets monthly and we can tour and talk to people in the hospital departments

* I will have a paid summer internship come June through the above program. Probably will be positioned in Anesthesiology. 

* Dabbled in video production, helped coordinate videos and shot some videos for charity

* Varsity member of a club (kind of regional, don't want to dox myself) that does testing events in team and individual sections, like biology, chemistry, computer science, etc. 

* Helped start a local rowing club, currently a member

* Latin Club (dropping it next year)

* In Civil Air Patrol, basically civilian arm of the Air Force, decent leadership position there

* Will be in NHS, trying to get leadership there
* Applying for the student advisory council of the Illinois Board of Education, will try my best to get it


Awards:

* Some awards in Latin, a CAD competition, and in biology, nothing major

Personal Profile:

* White boy

* From Illinois, not first generation, family income around 120k

Goals: Go to medical school. I don't want to go to a school that's too competitive and too expensive, since I want to save my money and GPA for medical school. I have been looking closely at National Merit schools to save money and resources. 

*I really don't care about prestige, but UIUC, UIC, etc. are out. I don't really care about weather, school spirit, location, type, etc. However, I care slightly about size. I really don't want a school smaller than Rice (3,910 undergrads). However, I don't care if the college is 66,000 people, just if it's too small. I want a school that can provide me with research opportunities as early as possible for an undergraduate and that will continue to have strong research resources while I'm there. Finally, the school should have good programs in other areas (I probably want to major in econ), so I can have a plan B in case medical school does not work out.*

**I guess my end goal is to quickly go through college but also enjoy myself along the way. I don't want to be miserable but I don't want to pay a premium just so I can drink and enjoy the social scene. To me, college is just one step to what I want to do, but I still want to enjoy my four years. No matter where I go, I want access to good resources (research, pre-med advising, etc). Private or public, prestigious or not, I don't mind. However, if I do go to a school that's not so prestigious, I want to be able to interact with a group of students who are ambitious and on the academic level that I am. I don't want to be the only mountain in the middle of an ocean.**

Here's some colleges I have been looking at. If it helps, I didn't really like Duke. It seems too much of a party school for me:

Reach:
UT Austin,
WashU,
UC Hicago,
Rice,
Northwestern (maybe),
UCLA (maybe)

Target:
Case Western,
Wake Forest,
University of Rochester,
Tulane (maybe)

Safety:
University of Alabama Tuscaloosa/Birmingham,
University of Oklahoma,
University of Cincinnati,
University of Illinois
Ohio State

**If you can also chance me for my reach schools (using my stats), that would be great.**

I'm 33 years old and have been working in sales management for 11 years. I have always been tech savvy and quick to pick up on things. 1 year ago I decided to go back to school and hopefully get a degree in something I'm very passionate in. However, instead of looking for the best online school to attend I settled for Rasmussen. After researching, I've come to the realization that they have a bad reputation to say the least. I seem to grasp everything I'm learning and have a 3.8 gpa. I'm 20 credits shy of an Associates Degree and have taken many of the core classes.  So here are the questions I have: 

Questions

1. Should I continue at Ramussen, finish my Associate degree and transfer to another school? ( If so reccomendations for online schools). Or transfer Asap.

2. Will companies look down on the school I attended? 

3. What types of projects should I have on my Resume and since an internship is more than likely out of the picture how can I break into the industry? When should I be looking to make the move? How much knowledge should I have when it comes to programming skills?

4. What are some other jobs a computer science job can get you that maybe easier to transfer into other than traditional development roles?

I appreciate any opinions. Thanks for taking the time.

I'm started to get rather frustrated and I'm looking to organize my thoughts.   This post is cathartic for me, but any insight you fine folks can offer would be greatly appreciated.  TLDR at the end. 

About me: I received a BA in Music about 12 years ago...because I was a silly young man and thought working up tons of student loan debt on a Music degree was a good idea...

Anyway, after a few years working a mediocre customer service job, I went back to my local community college and earned an AS in Computer Technology while continuing to work full time and changing positions from a Customer Service associate to a Technical Writer.  

During college, I learned a great deal about VB and a smattering of Java, but also Relational databases and some networking and web design fundamentals.  I discovered I had a strong affinity for OOP and was pretty much a rock star in the sterile classroom environment of my rural South Carolina college. 
 
Smash-cut to 3 years after finishing my AS, I've been pretty comfortable in my Tech Writer job, I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge in vital soft skills, communication, and project management/team leadership and I feel I am ready to move on.   In a legit effort to move into the Software Developer field, my entire family is in the process of moving to the DC Metro area for a better tech market. 
 
After over 200 resumes and applications, I've only been called back for 1 interview, with Booz Allen, And let me tell you guys....I nailed it.  Years of communication and serving as an IT/Operations liaison at my current job served me well.  I was grace under fire and that was the best interview experience of my life.  The recruiter called me the next day and said that I was marked as a ""firm fit"" for the behavioral and cultural aspects and that I would thrive in the organization...however I didn't have enough experience (for the JUNIOR developer position).   This was really a bummer.  

If I was a younger man and didn't have a family of 5 to take care of, I would be banging down the doors all over town trying to take on internship positions just to get a little experience, but at this stage in my life I simply cannot sacrifice salary or health insurance.  

So here I sit...trolling Dice and ZipRecruiter every day and applying for anything that remotely matches my skillset, getting more discouraged every day.  

I'm hoping to leverage my years of Technical Writing and Project Management experience to land a job on a development team.   I can talk theory all day, I have a firm grasp on the concepts behind OOP and development lifecycles, but I am utterly desperate for a job where I can just get my hands on a keyboard and get some practical experience in programming.  I am ABSOLUTELY confident that I can do the job and provide value, even at a very junior level,  

So....I just don't know what else I can do, guys...working a full time time job, trying to switch careers while raising a family, I don't think more school is the answer, I'm even tempted to try to get into bed with one of those indentured servitude bootcamp places at a severely-reduced salary just so I can write some code and gain practical experience.  

TLDR - I have 10 years of valuable soft skills and work experience, I have a BA in liberal arts and an AS in Computer Technology...but I have zero professional development experience and can't seem to even qualify for Entry-Level and Junior software developer positions.  Very frustrating.   "

I'm currently not working as tech support but rather doing an internship in strategy management at an IT security company in China.

This event took place about two weeks ago during our weekly sales meeting. Thing to note here is that the CEO was present (engineer), as was 2 product managers (who can repair their product lines down to the level of soldering new components to the PCBs). And the rest of the sales team, and our secretary. Oh, and the system installation is in Mandarin, a language I'm trying to learn. 

$Me - Yours truly.

$J - Sales manager who plays videogames on computers every night

$CEO - Engineer with 30+ years experience

$Sec - Secretary


During the meeting, $Sec suddenly runs into the problem that clicking any line in Excel marks multiple lines. She struggles, and $CEO takes the mouse and keyboard and clicks a few buttons, but nothing work. $Sec takes the control back and restarts Excel a few times, but the problem persists outside in Explorer, so when she tries to open the right document again, she opens three other documents.

Queue $J. Bolsterous as always, he grabs the mouse and keyboard and does the exact same thing as $Sec did. The fourth time he slams the mouse down on the desk and while I couldn't understand what he was saying, he was really frustrated. $Me tried to keep from laughing. 

$Sec takes back the keyboard and mouse and proceeds doing the exact same thing. At this point $Me has had enough of this farce, so I stand up and walk around the table to $Sec. I grab the keyboard, press and hold shift and hear the beep from Windows letting me know sticky keys was turned off again. One simple double-click later and the correct document is opened.

$CEO high fives me when I walk past him."

6apdjj,25,2017-05-12,Asian Father Always Talking about His Money,perpetualshine,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6apdjj/asian_father_always_talking_about_his_money/,"First time here. Our family immigrated to Canada when I was five. Since our family has very limited English capability, our father decided to head back to Asia to work. He is an entrepreneur who worked quite hard over the years to earn a small fortune. However, this meant he had to be out of the country for quite a lot of times and we don't really see him often. This is very typical for ""astronaut"" families.

It's been like this for many years - around the same time my sister is on this earth for (~15). In fact I don't get to see him often, probably around 1-2 months in total. Most days at home it was usually my mom, my sister and myself. We definitely became accustomed to this set-up of sorts, and I had no real problem in school or life. 

Now, after many years he has become relatively wealthy. However, I am not doing quite as well, and neither is my mother. Even though my college/university grades were okay (A- student) with good internships, I have been unable to find a job in this tough market. Also, the relationship between my mother and my father has deteriorated significantly, and I also noticed some serious mental health issues in my mother. She has an unbalanced emotional state, is always fatigued, and is short-tempered. I know my father has noticed this but he has not come back permanently to take care of the family. He is always saying ""someone has to earn money"" and ""if I still have the ability to earn money, I should"". 

He also told us he's worried about me and my sister's financial future and he's working to guarantee we are financially secure. He's become obsessed about retaining wealth, always asking me about what to invest in and the real estate market in Toronto (I'm a finance major so I am quite knowledgable). He also told me to come work for him instead on his new promising ventures. I respectfully declined since I have very little knowledge about the industry he's involved in and, to be honest, I would rather try to carve my own niche. When I decline to be involved in his investment discussions (he can talk a long time about them, and I need some time for myself), he says I should be involved since it's my money in the future. He also tells me to use his money if I don't have any, since he will never spend it all in his lifetime. 

At this point I am quite unhappy with the state of the family right now. I don't think my father should be working anymore - if he thinks he has enough money he should really be spending time with my mother. I don't think he understands that our family problems can be solved with him not trying to make money anymore, but to take care of his relationships with us. My sister is quite bitter about him because of his permanent absence. I understand that my father's family was not well off and he did accumulate much more wealth than his parents and enable us to live a life in Canada and pay for education for myself and my sister, but when is there ever enough money?

I guess part of why I'm ranting is that I'm unemployed and life generally sucks, but this persistent family problem has really been a drag for me mentally.

People in astronaut families, any advice on this matter???"

I decided to come to this subreddit for a couple questions. I wanted to go to college this coming year and can't really make up my mins. I'm heavily debating on something relating to computers. My questions are

• What is the difference between computer science vs computer engineering? I'm assuming computer engineering is a subcategory of computer science, but am curious as to what the major differences are.

•Is computer science/computer engineering hard to get a grasp of? (I know this depends on the person, but am curious for a general idea.)

•How many years of college am I looking at if I were to go through with this and what classes would I be taking if so?

•What would I expect after graduating college with such a degree?

•Is an online course a good idea or not? I don't really live near a college and can't afford housing near one, but am willing to go into debt if online college is a bad idea.

•Is the money there/worth it?

•And are there job opportunities or internships while in the middle of college courses for Computer Engineering.

Where I am in the US only has 2 colleges here in town, one is 10k for 2 years and an associates, the other is 45k per semester. This is why I will only be getting my AS. 

In school, we bounced around topics frequently. We mainly focused on Java and C#. But we covered at least 10 different SQL platforms, a small amount of mobile and web design and that's it. Our school focuses heavily on Java because most jobs that students get after graduating are with the state, which uses Java for most things. 

I wasn't able to get an internship, so I don't really have any experience outside of school. I intend to keep looking for one, because I wouldn't mind taking an internship if it potentially gets my foot in the door. 

I am learning some php for a potential job down the road that may be available, but I am trying to figure out how to efficiently use my time to begin the hunt for a job. At the moment, there are only senior development positions open in the area, and at most we have 2-3 jobs at any time available. 

I guess my question is for those who finished without an internship or without a job lined up after graduating. How did you focus your energy? Did you keep trying to refine your skills? Did you start learning topics not covered in school? 

I spent 2 years as a Business Analyst before going back to school. To a certain extent, I'd almost prefer going back to being a BA. I don't particularly find myself to be good at coding, and almost feel guilty allowing myself to try to do it for a living over people who are much better at it. I'm also terrified of programming interviews due to all the horror stories I've heard about them. I am not confident in technical answers to technical questions, nor am I great at coding off the cuff without having reference material to call on in tricky situations. We bounced around so much in 2 years that it was hard to consistently code in 1 language doing 1 task. We also had almost a full years gap in between some coding class levels. 

My future almost depends on whether or not I can turn this degree into a worthwhile career, so I am doing my best to try and figure out what steps to take and what steps to avoid. Sorry for the long post, it's just scary out there. "

So as of this past month I officially withdrew my funds to the college I had originally planned on transferring to after I finished up my primary classes at my current community college. I've finally realized that where I am isn't where I want to be and I want desperately to move back up to New York, near Albany area, and continue schooling at SUNY Albany, most likely switching majors to Psychology. This upcoming fall is my last semester at my current college, Fairmont State University in West Virginia, and after that my hope is to move on my own back up north. As of right now I live with my parents, but I'm working two jobs to save up enough for a decent cushion for when I do move. This entire summer is going to be dedicated to working and even then once the next semester starts up I don't plan on quitting either position, and will even be adopting a third in the form of a paid internship through the campus. A few months after finishing up my time at the school, I'll look into apartments and see what I can find, though I won't be able to tour any, I hope those posting understand my position enough to work with me a bit. I have my own car that can easily get me up there though hauling everything is a different issue entirely. Hopefully I will have enough saved up to give me a month or two leeway to find a job once I've gotten settled in the area. I'm fairly sure I won't be able to afford my own place but seeing as it's a college city, I'm somewhat banking on finding someone in need of a roommate. 

So that's basically everything in a nutshell, there's still loose ends to iron out but I'm fairly confident in the plan if a bit nervous. This is my first big leap into basically being an independent adult seeing as my only time living alone was being an RA and Camp Counselor. I'm 20 currently, will be 21 at the time of my moving, but there is something about this plan that feels right and it's been a real long while since I've felt okay about something like this.

Is there anything I should consider or take thought of that may not have came to me? Does this sound like a solid plan to anyone or maybe it's more of a dream than anything? Is this actually something I should see though or are there far too many red flags that should make me reconsider?"

I'm interning with a fortune 500 this summer in their IT department. After talking with them; however, the job seemed to be a lot more managerial. I would be driving the development of projects alongside my mentor. I am still not quite sure what I'll be doing because I'm not assigned to a team yet but I just wanted to ask if having a more managerial internship is a waste of my summer? Does it give me any buying power when applying next year to big tech companies for internships in software engineering and other computer science disciplines?

Thanks!"

I'm explaining this because I don't now what to do with my friends. I have 4 groups of friends, my whole life ones, and other ones from the gym, a company in which I worked, uni, etc. There are not many opportunities here for a recently grad so I need to commit myself 100% to work to obtain what my ambition demands since I was a kid.

The thing is that I'm really ambitious and I love to do sport, so my life turns around my career and doing sport. My whole life friends are not much ambitious people and they go out and party almost every week and complain about me not going out because I prefer to rest (I don't want to be sleepy at work, I need to be at my 100%), read a book about a subject related with my work or workout.

The thing is, that I know and feel that I'll lose them because of that and that if I do what they do, that will be a drag for my career. So I'm thinking about distance myself from them, but on the other hand, you know they are my friends...

I need advice on what to do..."

Now I am home and struggling to find an internship at an engineering firm because most of the large companies have already found their interns for the summer and I am unsure of how to approach smaller companies.

My question to you is: **if you were a small business owner, how would you want a student to reach out to you looking for summer work? How would you all recommend I approach this? Is it as simple as cold calling people, or are emails good enough? How do I even find a company that I would want to work for?**

I'm currently an undergrad at Georgia Tech, majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in scientific computing. I plan to do my school's online master's in CS after I graduate. 

I didn't major in CS because I don't want to get shoehorned into a CS job I don't find interesting; my CS interests are relatively narrow. I love high-performance computing, algorithms, numerical methods, and simulation. I have no interest in web-dev, servers, apps, databases, etc. My back-up (which I'd still enjoy) is to be a mechanical engineer. 

I'm a scientist at heart though. I love solving scientific problems and creating new knowledge. If the field wasn't so oversaturated and paid so poorly, I'd probably get a PhD and go into academia. But I'd rather not spend five years making nearly nothing doing a PhD and five more years making $40k as a post-doc for the off-chance of getting a tenure-track position.

I think I've found a good career option that combines science, engineering, and CS. Scientific software sounds challenging and interesting. Here are some jobs I think I'd like: [1](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/337074831/), [2](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/303632411/), [3](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/313273184/), [4](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/303870148/).

How should I pursue this? I have an internship this summer at NIST engineering lab; I'll be doing data analysis and simulation for their energy research. My ME degree already gives me a base of knowledge in physics, math, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and other foundation science.

What should I do to develop CS knowledge? It seems like NumPy, R, Matlab, Tensorflow, and other scientific tools would be useful. I'm reasonably proficient at Java and Matlab and next semester I'll be learning C.

I'm preparing to graduate with my BS in Electrical Engineering in 2018.

I go to a state school known for engineering but certainly not top 25, and should be able to finish with a solid GPA of 3.95+.

My GRE scores are: 
Q: 168 
V: 162 
W: 5

As far as letters of recommendation go I know I could get stellar ones from my two most recent summer internships. However, I believe that grad schools prefer to see them from faculty at my school. I should be able to get 2-3 letters of recommendation based off of a couple of projects but I really don't know if they will be stellar. 

I would like to go straight into a PhD program, though I am not opposed to the idea of getting a Masters first if that will help me in the long run.

My top schools would be: MIT, Caltech, Stanford, USC, Vanderbilt, UMich, UC Berkley, UIUC.

Is there any experience you all have with building up to a stellar LOR in a short time? Would it benefit me to apply to a Masters at a higher ranked school than my ugrad first? "
6aspn3,6,2017-05-12,"MSc, MBA, Industry? Where to from here?",internhopeful139754,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6aspn3/msc_mba_industry_where_to_from_here/,"Like to start this off by saying how beautiful this subreddit is. I have really appreciated your wisdom and always encourage my friends to check it out.

I am nearing the end of my Undergrad degree and I am having to make some decisions about my future. Put briefly, they are MSc, MBA, and/or industry. I'll start with a bit of background on myself, then my goals, and will listen to all tips you guys have!

**Background** 

* BSc Honors in Computing Science @ University of Alberta
  * 3.8 CS GPA, will finish with a 3.7 cumulative in December.
  * Worked in a lab for ~9 months during school, resulted in one publication. Know I can get an awesome reference from advising professor. Energy, software engineering, virtualization, etc
  * Attending weekly research discussion group of another professor. High performance computing, networks, large data transfer, cloud, etc. Possible decent reference.
* Work Experience
  * Two summers at provincial health insurance provider. Linux administration, backup, virtualization, etc.
  * 8 months internship at Intuit Edmonton. Front end software development.
  * 3 months (this summer) at Intuit in Mountain View, CA.
* Extracurriculars
  * 2 terms on the undergrad CS board
  * 2 terms Fraternity President
  * Few other involvement roles

**Options**

The pipe dream is running a tech startup. But, more realistically, I'd love to work in management down the road at a Big 4. End of the day, I want to learn lots and do lots. 

* MSc
  * Wasn't considering this till recently; more lean towards MBA. But, I see that more and more people need higher degrees, and I did enjoy my time working in the lab during my Undergrad. I would most likely focus on Artificial Intelligence, Energy, or Software Engineering. I have never really been interested in the super theoretical CS, but rather the parts that transfer over to business, every day, etc. My goal schools would be University of Toronto, Stanford, CMU, MIT, etc. Hard to tell how in or out of reach those would be. If I go this route, I would do more research at UofA during summer/fall before graduating. 
  * Thoughts on a few years in industry before MSc?
* MBA
  * For the last year, plan has been an MBA in a few years. Work industry for a bit, then do a US MBA. I saw this as a step towards management as I am not particularly fond of writing code for hours and hours on end. Really prefer the meeting of technical, customer, support, etc. Which leads to my interest in product management.
* Industry
  * I am not a great fan of writing software. Every once and a while I get a buzz from it, but my real interests are where tech meets business. I appreciate my technical undergrad for giving me understanding, but want to mesh that with something more. Ideally after graduation I would have an Associate Product Management role. That really is where I feel engaged and doing my best.

So, there it all is. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts! PM me for specifics, I tried to keep things brief."
6asy2e,2,2017-05-12,Internship with the Devil,notalwaysalright,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/6asy2e/internship_with_the_devil/,"First time posting so please be gentle.

Just so you have some background, I am a university graduate and college graduate with a bachelor of arts in media and a college certificate in art &amp; design respectively. I graduated last fall from the postgraduate program with honours and have been trying to find work as a graphic designer since then. I get lots of interviews but so far none have panned out and am literally doing everything I can (applying to every job even remotely related, cold calling, meeting people in the industry to butter them up so they might offer me something, enlisting the help of a headhunter etc.) It's a tough field to get into, jobs are limited and turnover isn't high so searches of up to a year are not uncommon, but I knew this going in so I am not surprised. 

Recently my father (who is very well connected in the realm of business) ran into one of my contacts in the industry who he also introduced me to. They got to talking about my troubles finding work and my contact offered a solution but said outright, ""notalwaysalright isn't going to like it.""

My contact says they might be able to pull some strings and get me an unpaid internship in a small and somewhat obscure but reputable design firm which has won awards in the past. Now, I know what you're going to say, and normally I would be jumping at this opportunity but there is a huge catch: the CEO is a complete monster.

I sh#t you not, this person is essentially the love child of the overbearing boss in *The Devil Wears Prada* and the crazy professor in *Whiplash* with a dash of the dipsh#t cokehead heir to the chemical company in *Bad Bosses.* Don't get me wrong, this person has a reputation in the community for being very talented…  but is also equally well known for being extremely volatile, demanding, pretentious and sometimes downright unhinged. More than a couple people from other firms I have spoken to have confirmed it and I have also experienced it firsthand.

Many months ago, I actually met crazy!boss for one of those informal meetings shortly after I graduated where you get to know someone in the industry, have them look through your work and maybe if there is a free spot they *might* hire you if they like you. 

To say the very least this meeting did not go well. Now, I have had my work criticized before - sometimes brutally - but I have always had a thick skin and don't let it get me down too much because a lot of design is subjective so you're bound to run into a few people that don't like your style and you can only improve through having your work criticized but crazy!boss took this to a whole new and personal level. Among the highlights of the absolute sh#tshow that was this meeting were:

	•	crazy!boss asking about my martial status and implying there was something wrong with me because I was single at the time
	•	being called a talentless hack with no imagination or 'uniqueness' to separate me from the crowd who crazy!boss would never hire based on the crap that was my portfolio
	•	having crazy!boss outright state that they were only meeting with me because they owed my contact and that they thought I only reason I was there was because my parents are wealthy
	•	being ripped a new one for being 'unprepared' because I only knew a little about the agency thanks to crazy!boss actually going out of their way to take down the company's website as soon as they heard I'd be coming in while also admitting that they did this to 'test me' and because I'd failed to gain anything more than scraps of information about their obscure artsy place through the internet that I'd failed and they would never hire me because of this
	•	being repeatedly asked if I was okay by crazy!boss throughout this process because I 'looked sad'
	•	having all of this done within earshot of all the other employees in this small office space so that everyone present could hear me receive this sh#tkicking very clearly
	•	being thrown out within 10 mins and being told to ""come back next week when you  got your sh#t together.""

Normally I am not someone who gets upset easily (extraordinarily rough childhood to thank for that) but this encounter actually left me in tears as I took the bus home and caused more than a few breakdowns in the week leading up to the second interview which ultimately went not as badly as the first by comparison but was still very difficult thanks to crazy!boss making it perfectly clear they didn't like me, were not at all impressed with my work and them expressing the opinion that I didn't belong in this industry. 

My question for all of you is WTF do you think I should do? Admittedly, this is a huge opportunity, but that being said if I do get into this internship (which is very likely to happen despite crazy!boss hating me because they owe my contact big time) I am extremely worried of the psychological strain this is going to put me through (I have had a fantastically horrible couple of years which has already left me extremely depressed/anxiety ridden so I don't know how much more I can take) and the potential issues that will arise if I quit (my contact would really be sticking their neck out for me to do this so if I quit then I will have burned my bridge with them throughly and they know literally everyone in the industry).

Any and all thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: I have the possibility of getting a very coveted internship through my connections but I would literally have to work with Satan themself, who already hates me, and I'm not sure I will survive working there. Help!**"

President of non-profit keeps calling gf in the middle of the night. When she tells president it's not appropriate and to stop harassing her, president threatens to not pay salary for April, which is already overdue by a couple of weeks. President (a female) also calls up GF's mother and other family member listed as emergency contacts, to ask why GF isn't picking up.!!!! (this too at around 3AM).

Other colleague of my gf who quit confirmed that her husband/ mother in law had been contacted at odd hours when she switched of her phone. When confronted, Jane asks gf to complete tasks not strictly part of the job description **to receive last month's pay!!**

Non profit, President are American, gf is indian. Not sure what recourse we have!



**Full story:**

Writing on behalf of my gf. My girlfriend started working in Jan for a non-profit based out of Maryland which focuses on suicide-prevention in India.

My gf (a psychologist/counsellor) and I are Indian, and she is paid a monthy salary to conduct a fixed number of anti-suicide workshops in India every month. The contract specifies her title as ""Project Manager"" and specifies conducting these workships as her main job, and assisting in creating things like newsletters etc as stuff on the side but part of the job. She's paid in rupees and the salary for the previous month usually arrives by the 2nd/3rd of each month.

Let' call her boss (who is also the president of the org.) Jane. This is a remote job (the org. is in MD and all the employees like my gf are in India). 

Upon joining, my gf was on good terms with the president who had been chasing her since around 9-10 months prior to get her to join this org (I can personally attest to this, Jane personally took GF out on lunch or some such thing whenever she was in India). My GF had worked with a common collegue of Jane in another non-profit and had great references.

My GF didn't want to join full time, so agreed to work part time in a limited capacity to help out with managing stuff for the company in India (at a greatly reduced salary which she was fine with, for the time she had agreed to put in with Jane). They agreed to updates twice a week over mail a call every weekend to see how things were progressing here. (Since the ~12 hr time difference made things difficult to communicate).

The really screwed up side of Jane turned up, only after she finally joined. 

Almost immediately she started calling my gf everyday, then after a week, 2-3 times a day (very often in the middle of the night around 3-4 am!). My gf thought Jane was a bit old and might not be used to the time difference, so informed her politely that she should pick a different time to call. 

Most of the times she called it turned out Jane was simply feeling lonely and would talk for more than an hour about stuff like American politics, Trump, her childhood on the pretext of having something urgent about work. 
After a couple of weeks, my gf (who I informed was being too nice by picking up these calls even once) started ignoring her, and reminded Jane of her aggreement where they had chosen to communicate biweekly.

Turns out Jane didn't give a fuck and started calling her 5-6 times a day. (I was with her at night multiple times when this happened, and had to endure this too). When my gf switched of her phone, she started calling up her mom! (that too at 3-4am at night). She had listed her mom as her emergency contact in the contract :|.

My gf got in touch with one other employee, also based out of the same city in India, and she too confirmed that Jane had been calling her husband at odd hours, when she too had switched of her phone after being harrased. Couple of weeks later, turns out Jane called up Gf's colleague's mother in law, (also listed as emergency contact) 14 times (!) in a row at around 2 am till she picked up. Gf's colleague snapped and quit (upon which she was told she was not dedicated enough for the job for not picking up Jane's calls). Jane was not right in the head clearly.

I urged my gf to quit, but she said she could handle it and, and was desperate for the money which she insisted was decent for supposed part time work (I disagree). 

The situation quickly became worse and Jane accused my gf of doing other stuff on the company's time (hilarious since this was a part time gig). Not picking up each of her calls was some sort of deriliction of duty. 

Gf has completed all deliverables, plus done extra stuff like interviewing interns etc which is not part of her job description. After my gf brought up that it was ridiculous that 'not speaking to me enough' was the quoted reason for witholding salary, Jane changed her tune, and said some newsletter that my gf had not mailed out by the end of April is the reason why she won't see a penny. 

(The truth is my gf had sent the newsletter for approval to Jane in time, and she never got the go ahead. Now she's sent a long list of errata and has said it has to be redone before it's considered to be 'complete'). Original job description mentions only set number of workshops as the main job (which gf has completed ahead of time each month).

Contract says Jane can pay gf upto 30 days after end of month for which salary is due. Jane keeps bringing this up, while saying complete the newsletter first then maybe I'll pay you.

Tonight Jane googled my GF and her blog, and asked ""you seem to have a lot of time to vacation and side projects"" (which she can, since this is not a full time job). ""Very interesting"", said Jane. I was creeped out when I found out.

Gf of course doesn't want to work any more (finally came to her senses) but wants her salary for April for which other than time, she also spent her own gas, internet etc for conducting workshops for which she is not paid seperately)

6atr9o,1,2017-05-12,Hired for a new job but confused about what is going on,yeahouita,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6atr9o/hired_for_a_new_job_but_confused_about_what_is/,"So I applied online for a position that was in a slightly new career area for me. I knew when submitting my resume that I was stretching my imagination to the idea of getting this job offer seeing that I could only offer semi related experience, and the position was  including directing interns and assistants (which is what I felt my skills more so reflected and where I would be placed.)

Anyway, I woke up the following morning with an employment offer package in my inbox from their contracting company. How exciting! I fill out the package and return the email, which followed with some correspondence over the course of a few weeks, stating that I have gone through screenings and finalizing that my on boarding with the company is complete. I was assured that the management team would reach out to me to set up my start date which was being reflected in the contracting company's system as 5/8.

That date came and went and I still did not hear anything from the management team, even after reaching out multiple times. Finally today I received an email from my employer stating that they are aware I am now in the system and ""Now it is all a matter of finding 1st time opportunities to get you in here."" (the position is for styling jobs on set of television shows)

My questions - What does this all mean? I am guessing it means that I am hired, although I know absolutely nothing about this position except for what was listed on the job posting. 
Does it mean that I could potentially wait around for mere weeks until they need me? It has been a month already since the beginning of this process. 
I feel as though I need a lot of training and am worried I will be thrown right in. It is compensated generously so I can't afford to loose this, although I have already finished working at my last job as I thought I would have started this new job sooner and can no longer afford to just wait around. 
It is just so hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that I have been offered a job but with no interview, understanding absolutely nothing and the company is unaware of my actual skill set. 
How do I respond appropriately to my employer's email of needing to find first time opportunities, even with my head filled with a million and one questions?"

I am currently an undergraduate chemical engineering major in a school in Florida.

I have been seriously searching for an internship since my sophomore Spring (early 2015) with absolutely nothing breaking through. I have had several interviews, especially my senior Fall, with many great companies like GE Oil and Gas, Dow Chemical, and Southern Company.

On the first of May, I interviewed with a smaller chemical company in Tampa and was against one other candidate. I was informed a few hours ago that I did not receive the offer. I'm currently at an all time low and do not know what to do with myself.

I will be graduating in December with no internship experience and am worried about being rejected from full-time job considerations because of that. I have had dreams about being a successful engineer, who moves up to become a CEO or owner of a company.

My resume is filled with leadership experience from many different organizations my time in college, and my GPA is 3.33/4.00.

Can I get any advice about what I should do in this situation and your predictions on my next step of finding a full-time position? I would appreciate any feedback and thank you for your time."

I recently had an interview for a gig at a tiny (&lt;10 people) startup. The internship aligns really well with my goals, and the person I spoke to seems really cool.

That said, the internship might be unpaid; if it's not, it'll be a tiny stipend. It's remote, so I won't have to pay for housing or anything b/c I'll just be living in my apartment for the summer.

For the follow-up, they've asked me to take a look at a website and some promotional materials and essentially ""user test"" it, giving some feedback and basically writing out what I would change and why. It kind of feels like they're just trying to get free work from me, but I also know that they don't have anyone who would do this work at the moment, so maybe they aren't?

I applied to a ton of programs for the summer but only heard back from like 2; I got rejected after the first round from one, after the final round from the other. Until this, I was just going to spend the summer coding up an app or some sort of project just to have that on my resume. Even if it's unpaid, should I take this job? It'll basically be the same sort of stuff I'd do otherwise, but I'll at least get a reference out of it.

Thoughts on the job as a whole or on the interview project they're having me do?"

I am about to start self-teaching web dev in a more full-time way, with the (eventual) goal of working remotely/freelancing. My plan was to spend some time self-teaching and creating projects, then try to get a web dev internship, and then try to pick up clients from there once I have some experience. 

A friend of mine suggested that rather than going for javascript/CSS/HTML, I just learn WordPress and start freelancing that way. Does anyone have experience with this? Is it a good idea to just start freelancing with WordPress instead of taking a longer path to learn languages and gain web dev experience?

Long story short, for numerous reasons, I'm considering getting out of the reserves to focus on my career, portfolio, and be able to secure internships. I'm not asking for a pep talk from a prior military personnel about my decision, but I would like to know from people in the field, potentially HR representatives that frequent this sub, how an OTH from a reservist unit would be looked at. The dilemma that I am faced with is either continue to serve the way that I have been, and have to use an extra year to finish school without internships due to the drill times, or leave and devote myself even deeper to CS.

From an HR standpoint, how would this be viewed in the field of Computer Science? I feel that if necessary, I can explain myself well enough to any hiring manager. I want to write beautiful code, code that helps people. I want to be able to serve the people of the world in a way that I can't in a near-grunt position.

Any input is invaluable. I know this may seem as trivial because the obligation is a weekend a month, but it has been a constant obstacle preventing me from reaching my full potential. 

Thank you in advance."

I did some college for a trade like program but working in a manufacturing shop, I hated it a lot. May be it was the workplace it self, the managers never acknowledged hard work and kept pushing for faster work (comparing us to cheaper workers elsewhere in the world), but I digress.

Any ways, I have always loved computers, and despite my tendency for IT/programming/dev, everyone kind of pressured me to do something else. Now I have just finished a semester for software development degree at my current school, and it was great. 

However:

1. I am entering 30s. I hear IT and coding is not old friendly at all. There are some vague assurances, but the overall vibe looks negative. That's a bummer becuase I was able to code better than my younger peers (intro, sure who cares about noon loop programming,  but I enjoyed it and the logic behind atleast while many hated it). So tell me this, is my passion and skill enough to gain an entry level position and keep in the coding sphere for atleast a few years? Or is this a lost cause? 

2. People who consult, how do you eventually gain ""authority"" in a field where things change overnight? I have seen a energy company plant lead hand become a consultant which is called by everyone daily, but they have knowledge that won't be deemed obsolete by a new young hire .How does a software guy do this?

3. Given the above, and also considering that electrical engineering is usually more saturated (but less volatile in a way), would it make sense to just switch into that because I can currently do so without course penalties. I am sure I can finish the course with good marks, I love math. But then I give up my dream of doing what I like.

4. Would it be a better idea to just aim places like banks etc right from the start (aka internships) instead of traditional coding shops? It seems many banks are willing to gobble up devs. The aim would be not to dev for them forever, but to learn something important in their business and hold a critical position+knowledge combo.

5. I am also eyeing Netsec, or IT security. I am already teaching myself Linux, and plan to learn pentesting as well as a start. Is that even a 'safer' alternative to traditional dev work?

Sorry for the long post 

TLDR: Guy studying software development while entering 30s is worried about getting his first few years of experience thanks to perceived ageism."
6avb9z,1,2017-05-12,Emotionally conflicted on social life and personal goals: what can I do to find some peace?,YoureMakingMeLatte,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6avb9z/emotionally_conflicted_on_social_life_and/,"Hello. I apologize if this post is a little long-winded, but I'll attempt to narrow it down. I'm having some major conflicts that I need advice for, and I feel the people in my life won't know how to answer them. I definitely need to give some backstory otherwise my questions will seem a bit strange. I'll start with categorizing my problem(s), and then proceed with questions.

A quick biography: I'm an introvert and I regain my energy from being alone with hobbies. I also consider myself to be pretty social as I have a good amount of friends and am happy with where I am right now. I have some life goals that I need to achieve like minor weight loss, better fitness, pursuit of an internship, future career goals, etc.

**PROBLEMS** 

 * Since the college semester has ended, I have more free time to engage in things that I want to do. Right now I have this major knot in my gut from twisted emotions about not being around people, wanting to ask people to hang out, being afraid of getting let down/rejected, and trying to find the right people to hang out with. I can totally just call someone and ask, and there's really not much preventing me from doing it. The only thing is, I don't want to pester people with requests to hang out and make it look like I'm desperate. I guess my problem, socially, is that I feel like I need to be out doing more than what I'm presently doing. I also have things that I really want to do and to share it with other people, but I know that they'll either say they're busy or say no. I feel like if I go out and do this stuff by myself, it will feel empty...

 * There was a time (2-3 years) when I felt like being around other people wasn't necessary. I was genuinely happy with doing things by myself and enjoying hobbies. I still talked to and hung out with an amount of friends, but I was overall content with being alone. I didn't care about love interests, new acquaintances, or really anything outside of personal gain. Eventually, I joined a social group through one of my friends and developed an affinity for being around people and sharing time with others. More recently and over time, being alone does not have as much charm. I'm really conflicted with who I was and who I want to be, and whether or not I prefer the former or latter. I feel like I am stuck between two sides of myself and I can't be happy with either of them.

 * I have recently been trying to find a significant other. I know for a fact that I have had some girls interested in me that I could have gone after, but for some reason I don't engage. I can't engage. I think it's because I'm afraid that I'll ruin the opportunity with something stupid that I do or say, and I won't even be able to at least be their friend if it goes badly. I know that ""you miss 100% of the chances you don't take,"" but I'm just.. afraid. I'm confident in being me, and I know what kind of person I am, it's just that I can't stomach the thought of something negative happening. I also don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice so much of my time to commit to someone else, but I also want to be with someone else. I want to know someone on a molecular level, but I need to have my own space.

 * I have a best friend and co-worker (we will call her Blue) that I've had a growing infatuation for that I fear is not productive. Basically, she is in a relationship (Not totally sure; she doesn't talk about him) with a man in the military, who she has a child with, and who she is living with his parents. From an obvious standpoint, she has three layers of personal security that bar me from any chance at attempting the slightest inquiry. My brain is telling me *ABORT ABORT* but my heart is pointing at signs of her reciprocating my interest. There was a night she and I went out for food, and we must've talked for hours. We both laughed, talked about serious stuff, and just enjoyed each other. She expressed interest in things I thought she would absolutely despise, and it sparked this little flame that grew. To summarize my experience with her: I feel like I have gotten signals from her about being intimate, but I feel like I am misconstruing them from the hope of a chance at a relationship. From past experience, I know if I say something I will ruin this friendship and so I am very conflicted. I seriously value being her friend, but a chunk of me wants to be closer to her and it's starting to ache.

**QUESTIONS**

 * Should I just ask friends to hang out regardless of their answer or the negative implications of asking (being perceived as annoying and desperate)?

 * Should I feel like I need to be out in the world and enjoying life, or should I just stay introverted?

 * Should I pursue more constructive goals first, and then worry about my social life? ... Should I even worry about a social life?

 * Do I go out and experience the things I want to do, even if it isn't with someone else?

 * Among three of the girls I'm interested in and I know would reply, how can I nonchalantly ask them to go out without it being obvious that it's asking them on a date?

 * What is the best way to start a conversation with them to make it seem like it isn't my sole purpose just to ask them out?

 * Do I pursue Blue, or force myself to stop crushing on her?

___

These are some things I really need some insight on. I can't seem to come to a conclusion on my own and it feels like there is a war going on in my mind. My stomach is churning with a melting pot of positive and negative emotions that I can't choose from and it's really maddening.

If you managed to read this entire thing, thank you so much for taking the time to go through it. I appreciate any advice you can provide."

6azhgw,1,2017-05-13,Looking for my first software engineering internship. Can I get a resume critique?,agsking,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/6azhgw/looking_for_my_first_software_engineering/,"Resume: http://i.imgur.com/MZSi4GV.png

I've just completed my Sophomore year of college in the Bachelor of Computer Science program at my college. My college has an optional internship/co-op program for the summer between sophomore and junior year. I have been applying to many listings on my schools co-op/careers website, with very few responses.

I want to have a career in software engineering, and would prefer my internship to be relavant to that, however as this is an optional internship, and the first position I would have in the field, I would also be happy in a related position like IT, system administration, etc.

I go to school in a big city, but I live (for this summer. I'll be in the city permanently after this summer) about 40-50 minutes away (with no traffic, which isn't realistic for commuting hours). I have my location listed as the city, as that is where most of the job opertunities are. I have also been trying to find positions closer to where I currently live. Does having the city as my location hurt my chances with getting responses outside of it? Should I remove the location completely? Keep the state?

I don't know if this shows in my resume, but I have a hard time bragging about my skills. I never really think that the projects that I do are impressive to other people, but apparently they are. If I'm asked ""what do you know/what skills do you have/etc."", my response would not be very good, but if I was, for example, told a problem, and asked how to solve that problem (and in doing so, my skills are shown), I would likely do very well. In reality, in terms of technical skill or something, I'm probably in the top 25% of my class/major. I'm very happy with my GPA, but I'm worried that it's not enough to show how much I really know. Is there anything I can improve on my resume to show this?

There were circumstances that made me to decide to leave my most recent employment (Lowes) without a 2-week notice. In retrospect, this was a bad idea, and I should have just suffered for two weeks to leave on good terms, but I didn't. If I don't list the job, then it appears that I haven't worked since 2015 and have only ever had one job. I did work there for around 3 months though, which is around the length of a summer employment, so as long as the employer is not contacted, nothing appears to be out of order. I might be overthinking this though (I was never a bad employee, the only thing was leaving without a notice), as I did not leave when I was really needed for anything, so contact with them might not be that bad. I'm also thinking that because the work is unrelated to what I am looking to do, either it is unlikely that they will be contacted or what they say will not be weighted very highly. What should I do about this?"

6b02m5,1,2017-05-13,"[X-Post] Opinions on Getting a BS in EE in 3 semesters, or an ME in EE in 5 semesters?",xpistolxwhipper,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/6b02m5/xpost_opinions_on_getting_a_bs_in_ee_in_3/,"(Cross posted with /r/engineeringstudents)

Hello!
I am currently studying electrical engineering at a large state university, planning to have my 'emphasis' be systems and controls (vs. something like VLSI, communications, etc.). I will be starting in on my first controls course this fall. The reason I chose controls was due to my participation in FTC Robotics back in high school - I like robotics quite a bit. I have been lucky enough to have 2 internships so far, both with the same company. Before I graduate with a bachelor's, I will have the opportunity to get one more internship.
As I stand currently, I can graduate with my BS in EE in 3 semesters. This doesn't require a huge course load at all - 14, 16, and 16 credit semesters. I can handle it, I have a 4.0 so far. My other option is to take 5 semesters and get both my BS in EE as well as a Master's of Engineering in EE (again, systems and controls). I'd do this in 5 semesters by taking advantage of my school's option to take some courses that dual-count towards my grad degree as well as my undergrad. I can complete 15 credits of a masters by the time I'd finish my BS in 8 semesters, leaving me with a summer of 3 credits+internship, as well as one more semester of 12 credits to get the ME.
This is a pretty tough decision! I'd love to hear your opinions about this, from a variety of perspectives.
First off, money. Will I earn more money with an ME? What about an MS? Both are options, I'm just not interested in research. Getting the masters would remove me from a full year's salary (~$70K), as well as the cost of school for the year (~$20K). I would get one additional internship, however, which would probably earn me close to $11K.
From a happiness perspective, I'm getting burned out on school. Courses are getting harder, which stinks, but I think I can handle the course load. I just don't know if I WANT to do it for another year. During the summer, I love working my 8-9 hour day, coming home, and forgetting about it. (well, I'm taking online classes over the summer, but you get what I mean!). I would be missing out on some extra time with good friends I've made, but I think I could live with that.
From an 'employability' perspective, how would this affect how much employers want me? With two internships under my belt by the end of this summer, 2 years with a 4.0 GPA so far, as well as president of an engineering organization at my school, I think I'm sitting in a comfortable position to secure a job at most places if I keep busting my ass to get there.
Again, what are your thoughts? Thanks so much!"

6b0hso,28,2017-05-13,Brown or Harvard?,horbthrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6b0hso/brown_or_harvard/,"A bit of background on this: So, I got into Brown regular decision, and committed last month. Harvard and Brown been my top two choices throughout the college admissions process, basically tied with one another. I was waitlisted at Harvard, and I signed up for the waitlist not really expecting much, as the chances of getting off the waitlist are admittedly tiny. Lo and behold, I got a voicemail from the Harvard Admissions office yesterday afternoon, explaining that the class for this year was full, but that I was part of a small, select group of kids being offered admission for the class of 2022. The admissions officer coined this option as a ""forced gap year,"" so to speak. So now, I have 2 weeks to decide between Brown next year, or a gap year and then Harvard, and I thought I might come to A2C for some opinions.

The main thing that sticks out about the offer is the concept of the gap year. I had never, ever planned on taking a gap year, and I had always regarded them as an option for rich kids to go off into the sunset and have fun at their parents' expense. However, after I received the voicemail, I decided to call the admissions office back (mainly to thank them), and the admissions officer I spoke to gave me some new perspectives on the concept of the gap year. He said that if it was his choice, he would force all of the incoming students to take a gap year, as the stress of performance in high school can translate to burning out in college. He also said that kids who take a gap year are typically much better prepared for the rigors of college, and have a better sense of what they want to do in college. After hearing this, I realized that I have been very stressed over the course of the past two years, and a break from academic pressure could allow me to readjust and think a bit more about what I want out of college. The big issue is, I have no idea what I would do over this gap year, especially since its now very late for finding jobs/internships. I feel strongly that I don't want to spend my time in my home city or at home, and my parents agree with this. I would be able to stay with relatives across the country for a good part of the year, but I do not know how easy/hard it would be to find employment over there. Furthermore, I think it might be possible to do a foreign program for part of the year, but it would need to be inexpensive, as I can't spare money before going into college. Finally, one of my worries about the gap year is that I would not be able to meet with kids my age and have the social life that any 18 year old would want. I don't want to be isolated, and I'm worried that a gap year would not allow me to meet any new people, and it would be weird coming into college a year later than everyone (though I do understand a lot of kids at Harvard defer). I would still say that I do not really want to do the gap year, and I think that it would be better to start college this fall; however, I am no longer going to discount this opportunity simply because of the gap year, because I do see its benefits, and I want to consider what I would do before I go. 

The next thing I need to consider is my fit with the schools. I wouldn't say that I'm particularly quirky, but I think Brown does fit in much more with my social side. When I visited during ADOCH, I quickly noticed that the kids were collaborative and friendly, which I something I really do appreciate. I'm not sure how Harvard is socially, as I never got a chance to meet with students there (though I have visited a few times), but I have heard that it is fairly academically cutthroat. Given the fact that I've been under academic pressure for a long time, I think Brown may be more laid back as well, and that I would probably be happier at Brown. On the other hand, I think that Harvard fits much more with me academically - I am fairly academically driven (and a lil' bit cutthroat = ]), and the sense of pure inspiration and awe that I felt while visiting Harvard was like nothing I experienced at any other school. Also, the idea of studying in a place with so much history and background is meaningful to me. The few Harvard students I have met seemed much more like me than the Brown students I met, though I'm sure there is a lot of overlap in each school. 

According to my college counselor, there is a sense of ""the grind"" at Harvard that is not present at Brown, where students tend to take a greater joy in exploration and learning. In terms of the subjects/majors I think I'm interested in, Harvard tops Brown, as Harvard has some of the best Political Science, History, and Economics in the world. I think distributional requirements at Harvard might make me more well rounded, and allow me to meet people outside my major I would not otherwise meet) I would not consider myself interested in STEM. However, as someone who is still largely undecided, I like how Brown's open curriculum allows students to forge their own path. I also like the pass/fail system at Brown, as I think it would reduce a lot of stress, though I understand there is a large stigma around using it. I appreciate that Brown is more focused on undergraduate teaching: One of my worries is that since Harvard has such a large grad body, there will be lots of classes taught by TAs (especially in distributional requirements, but I do not know if this is the case. Since I know that prestige is a big thing on A2C, I'll say that I do not care too much about the prestige (I recognize that they are both fantastic schools), but I also maintain the belief that Harvard's alumni network could be a huge benefit for the rest of my life, and that Harvard has a better standing for political/economics related job opportunities. 

In terms of location, I much prefer the ""college town"" vibe of Providence and College Hill, and the fact that there are actual green spaces not filled with tourists. When I first stepped on the Brown campus, I was astounded by its beauty. At Harvard, I liked the campus, and the vibe of Cambridge as well. Also, I love the grandeur of Harvard, and the residential college system, which would help create a sense of community. The dorms at Brown are notoriously bad (which I don't mind too much), and the ones that I saw were pretty gross. I haven't seen Harvard dorms, but I've hear that they're nicer. 

Now, on to financial aid. Going to Brown would likely cause me to accumulate some debt: based on my family's predictions, the absolute maximum amount of debt I could accumulate would be roughly 40k, though it would very likely end up being much smaller (how much, I am unsure). Harvard did not include a financial aid offer in their email, but I plan on calling the admissions office to get a good idea as soon as they are open on Monday. However, based on their calculator, I would likely graduate from Harvard with zero debt. If that were the case, I could probably spend a little money during my gap year doing something special, though I don't know how much these types of programs cost.

Finally, the wild card. I did a bit of reading on this type of deferred offer, known as the ""Z"" list. Based on what I read, this list seems to be reserved for people who have some special sort of connection or bought their way into the school. I have no legacy at Harvard, and my family and I have not paid a dime to Harvard. I have no clue how I ended up in this situation, but I did quite a bit of full time, unpaid work (internship) for a Harvard graduate during a winter, and I asked them for a letter of recommendation for my application. That said, given that Harvard has so many famous and incredibly powerful grads, I don't know how this letter may have helped, as I am sure many other kids got letters from people far more influential. I am by no means under-qualified (stats), but I fear that this list is for kids who would not have otherwise gotten in and are not as deserving of spots. Throughout this admissions process, I have been very much against the use of special connections/interests to get into college. If I found out that something not merit based (such as this letter, though I did work hard for it) got me put on the list, I feel that I would be morally against going to Harvard.

At this point I am still getting opinions from as many people as I can. I am currently leaning towards Brown, but less so than I was initially. My family seems to be fairly split on this one, unsurprisingly. I will probably continue to edit this post as I have more thoughts, but for now I wanted to hear what you guys think. Harvard or Brown? 

**tl;dr** committed to Brown, now have the option of doing a gap year then Harvard. Would probably be happier at Brown, but more academically satisfied and inspired at Harvard. I want to go somewhere where I can really take joy in learning, but also have pride in my work and collaborate with my classmates. What to do?

*edit:* I should probably make it clear that the letter said that if I took the Harvard offer, I would not be able to enroll at another school before hand. So going to Brown and then Harvard is not an option."
6b0ph3,0,2017-05-13,Questions about McGill's Computer Science program,dragonage496,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/6b0ph3/questions_about_mcgills_computer_science_program/,"Hello,

I am a grade 12 Ontario high school student accepted to McGill’s computer science program. However, I’ve been having trouble finding information about the program, and also have some questions regarding it. If anyone could help myself, and potentially other students by answering what you know about any of the following questions, that would be really helpful to us all in making our post-secondary decisions!

So there is information about what courses are to be taken in the McGill CS program: http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2017-2018/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science

However, I have a few questions regarding that link:

1. I assume the first digit of the course code indicates what year the course is intended for. However, the courses in that link all start at 2, and some of them end in 5. Are the courses that start with 2 designated for the first year students?

2. It says at the bottom: “The remaining credits are selected from computer science courses at the 300 level or above”. Where can I find access to information about these courses in the later years? Could someone provide a link to them?

3. Is there a suggested course sequence schedule for McGill computer science, like the one presented here? : https://cs.uwaterloo.ca//current/programs/suggested/2015-2016/bcs 
	This layout shows the courses I would take in each semester of each year.

4. I am looking for a program that will challenge me academically. How difficult are the courses in McGill’s CS program, and are there any advanced courses that I can take to challenge myself?

5. This question is not regarding course information, rather summer internships and co op positions. I would like a university which keeps me busy during the summer all four years. I know that McGill’s CS program has no specified co-op feature, however I’ve heard online about internships being offered for the CS students. How do those work? Are there services provided by McGill university to help you get those internships, or is it completely up to the individual to seek them out and apply for them? Is there anywhere online where one could find more information about internships for computer science students at McGill, and would anyone like to share their experience with internships in this program? Also, would being weak in French be a disadvantage for software internships?

Thank you very much for all of your help! And to other prospective students, I’m sure if you have your own questions you can leave them in the comments and someone could start a discussion with you about them.

6b1948,85,2017-05-13,Waterfalls Hospital.,Kabukikitsune,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6b1948/waterfalls_hospital/,"Hospitals are, by their very nature, creepy places.  Doesn't matter if you're there for a checkup, or a long term stay, or just there visiting a relative, something about a hospital at night...well it'll send a chill up the most hardened person's spine.  It's worse in the basements, well, when they have basements.  Most do, though a few newer hospitals have done away with the ""basement"" in favor of mechanical rooms; usually located some distance from the main hospital itself.  Whatever the case, there's almost always something off about those areas.  Maybe it's something to do with the morgues always being there, or maybe just some old fears we as children one had. Fears of the unknown, or the dark.

The Waterfalls was no exception to the creepy hospitals. Though its creepy factor was doubled due to the place having been abandoned since the mid 1970's.  As if being a hospital isn't bad enough, an abandoned building? Well that made things MUCH worse.  I first stumbled across the building my second year of college...which is to say, I passed the building every day on my way to class, I just had never really paid it much attention before that.  The college I attended was actually located on the grounds of the old hospital, with several of the outlying wings turned into dorms, and classes in newer buildings further out.  The main building, a castle like structure of hand formed brick and mortar, rising three stories to its old slate roof, sat boarded up and abandoned on the northern end of the property.  The college had attempted to renovate it a number of times, only to have various problems arise.  I think the last attempt had been the year before I started there, where asbestos was supposedly found.  Least, that was the story we were told.  There were rumors about the real reason, though as with all rumors they were far fetched and hard to believe.

The Waterfalls hospital, named for two waterfalls located on the grounds, had been founded in 1885.  It was built as a medical college and treatment area for the mentally insane, and turberculosis. Compared to other TB wards in the nation, such as the better known Waverly in Kentucky, The Waterfalls was seen as good as, if not better. Though by the mid fifties, it had largely fallen by the wayside.  The sick out numbered the insane by a figure of three to one, and conditions within the wards quickly deteriorated to the point that the hospital picked up a number of...let's just say less than complimentary nicknames.  I think perhaps the most telling of those was ""The bone yard."" Locals believed that any person who was sent to The Waterfalls, was not sent there to get well...but instead sent there to die. Given the treatments for TB and insanity being archaic at best then, it's no real shock that a person admitted there, would expect to never leave.  

The college itself trained doctors and nursing staff to assist those who were sick, serving as a teaching hospital until the hospital closed in the 70's. Even after that, the medical program there continued until the mid 90's, when I enrolled there to study nursing.  

Though the reputation of patients never leaving was an accurate, if poorly deserved one, there were darker rumors that were never substantiated.  Probably the worst of those centered around an incident which happened in 1952. 

I stumbled across the incident myself, while doing a report for one of my professors on the treatment of various diseases in the mid twentieth century.  It was in an old archived news paper where I read the headline ""Doctor at Waterfalls Hospital Sought for Questioning!""  Quickly skimming the story, I read that one of the head doctors of the college, was sought for questioning as a result of an apparent murder which happened on the college grounds several weeks prior.  Moving further back through issues of the paper, I came across the report of the murder itself.  According to the article, a young nurse had been discovered murdered on the upper floor of the old main building; her body tucked into a small broom closet.  The doctor, her direct supervisor, was a prime suspect; due in no small part to her having accused him of being responsible for the disappearance of four young people two years prior in 1950. It was theorized in the papers, that the nurse had been murdered by the doctor, to prevent her from testifying to his crimes.  I scanned through several more papers, but far as I could tell, the Doctor had seemingly vanished, and the case had gone cold.

I've always been the curious sort, so when I turned up this odd story, I decided to do some more digging in on it. Like I said, I was just curious. Truth be known, between my hours on duty for my internship, and classes, I still had a lot of free time, and not much to do in the area. So, I poked around.  My first stop was to ask one of the older professors there who, far as I knew, had been with the school for some forty years (This was in the 90's, so he would have likely been there around the time of the murder) and see if he could remember anything about it.  I actually planned on writing up a long article for the school's paper, something for our pending halloween issue, which would detail this dark unsolved murder and the darker history of the College and Hospital.  I...well I honestly wish I'd just left well enough alone.

Speaking with the professor, I got the impression he wasn't exactly comfortable telling me the story, but eventually agreed as long as I kept his name out of it as my source.  According to him, while he was serving his internship, there was a rumor among the students and some of the doctors, that the head doctor had been involved in some very questionable medical practices.  Emphasis on questionable.  I won't go into details, but suffice it to say that horror movies have nothing on what this guy was suspected of doing.  In any case, after the disappearance of a number of patients, with the last one being the daughter of a prominent doctor at the hospital itself, the head doctor's practices had started to come to light.  His own vanishing seemed to prove his guilt, though the bodies of those missing were never found.  It had been suspected, by the hospital staff involved, that the doctor had hidden the bodies somewhere on the property of the hospital itself, either somewhere in the building; or on the grounds.  Over the years, the police would be given a tip, or a lead, or something and come searching once more.  In fact, the year before, the whole asbestos thing was more a cover up than anything.  While tearing down a wall in the basement, one of the crew had stumbled across a hidden room.  This prompted the police to investigate, and in doing so they turned up some very horrific things, including what they believed was a room of human remains in the form of ashes, as well as a stack of suitcases and possessions.  The remains had been removed from the building quietly and buried somewhere on the property, while the various possessions and et-cetera had been left behind.  

Leaving him, I decided that it might be best to explore the hospital myself.  My curiosity had gone and was replaced by my journalistic side.  At least, that's what I told myself.  

Getting into the old building actually proved easier than I expected. Though the windows on the ground floor were all boarded up, I found that one of the old side entrances was unlocked and slightly ajar. Slipping inside, I was met with the sickly sad face of a old faded poster which touted the benefits of yearly checkups. Beyond that, the room was pretty much empty, well other than a few upturned waiting chairs and papers scattered about the floor.  Broken glass from the window behind me littered the floor, and I could make out a few footprints. Likely from the workmen from the year before. Waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, not willing to give away my presence by lighting my torch, I stood there a good ten minutes before moving out into the main hallway.

Turning to the left, I walked halfway down the hall before I found a heavy door marked ""stairs.""  This would lead to the bowels of the building, and take me to the place I sought.  The door opened silently, a testament to its builders, and revealed beyond itself a simple iron and concrete staircase.  Testing to make sure it held my weight, I paused and finally turned on my torch.  The light shone through the gloom and while it did little to push back the darkness, it made me feel better.  I have never been one to believe in superstition, such as spirits, but even I admit that hospitals are creepy. 

Moving down the stairs, I came to another door. This one opened with a screech of metal and rust, causing me to freeze in place.  I expected the security to have heard that, so I didn't move for a time. No one came calling, so I assumed that I was far enough down that the sound had gone unnoticed.  That or the guards were used to hearing strange sounds from the building.  Chuckling to myself at their ignorance, I exited the stairs, and like the floor above, found myself in a long hallway.  As before, this one was dotted with doors down its length, though a quick examination by me provd that these were padded cells for the mentally insane. I shuddered to think the horror those imprisoned here must have gone through, even up to the hospital's final closing. Moving down this hall, I came to an intersection which mirrored the main atrium above. Here though, two short halls branched off. One leading to the right, to a pair of double doors marked ""morgue"" and the other to the left to a large steel door marked ""Machinery.""   It was through this machinery door that the hidden room lay, and ultimately would be my goal.  

As I panned my light around, for an instant I believed I saw a figure standing in the morgue. Moving close to the doors, I peered in through the glass port hole and shined my light around.  I saw no person, though I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. Pushing through, I found something that struck me quite odd.  The morgue was actually rather small.  A cooler for bodies stood at the end of the room, having only four drawers.  Directly in front of it, a small trolley sat, resting on tracks embedded in the floor. These tracks, I noticed, went under the door and out into the hall.  On one side, tucked back into a wall was an old service elevator.  That of everything made sense to me.  TB was, more often than not, a deadly illness. It wouldn't do to have patients seeing the dead being removed through the building, so the elevator would have made moving a body down to the morgue much easier. Though I had not explored any further than this, I guessed that another elevator must stand somewhere in the building. That one for moving the living around.  Shaking off the feeling of being watched, I cast my torch around again, and realized that what I was looking for, was the one thing missing from the typical tools found in such a place.  There was no autopsy table.  I reasoned that it must have been removed shortly after abandonment, though I couldn't figure why they wouldn't have removed the coolers or the odd trolley itself.

As I pondered this, I once again felt as though I was being watched. Turning quickly, I caught movement out of the corner of my eye through the doors. Stepping quickly out, I shone my light down the two halls, expecting to find one of my mates playing a trick on me; or possibly one of the city's homeless squatting in the building.  Nothing stood out, so I decided that it must just be my mind playing tricks on me.

Turning once more to my task, I crossed the wide hall and pressed my hand against the old metal door to the machinery room. It actually felt warm to the touch, though I quickly dismissed this.  It was a warm august night, and there was no air moving down here.  So it only made sense that the metal might seem warm.  Pushing on the door, I found it would not budge more than a few inches.  As I pressed, I found that it felt like something was pushing from the other side.  As if a person was standing with all their weight against the door, in an effort to stop me from going further.  Leaning hard on the door, I gave it a mighty shove, and was rewarded with it opening about a foot. Squeezing through that opening, I turned the torch around to discover that a chair had been wedged under the door in an effort to prevent it from being opened.   At the time this really didn't stand out in my mind, but looking back I know it should have.  Far as I could tell, there was no other way into that machinery room than by the door I had just came.  Yet here someone had wedged a chair against this door to keep it from opening.  Curious to say the least.

Turning the torch to my surroundings, I found myself in a relatively large room, old ductwork hanging from the ceiling, and more steam pipes than I want to count. I had reached the boiler room, best I could tell, and no spirit had stood in my way. Yet, the more I looked around, the more I came to the conclusion that I hadn't reached what I thought. The pipes turned and passed through a wall to my left, and while what I thought was a boiler sat on the far end of the room, closer inspection revealed it to be nothing more than a large water heater.  On the opposite wall, a large chunk of the masonary had been removed to reveal an older door heading through to a room beyond.  Leaning through I cast my light around, and found that this was a small ante-chamber to something else, with a pair of double doors (old wooden ones no less) on one end, and a smaller (also wooden) door with transom on the right.  This room curiously had a number of shelves around it, each with a small alcove set aside.  I reasoned that this was where the remains had been discovered, though as to how they got there wasn't known.  In my research, I did find that at one time the hospital had its own crematorium, but that had been removed in the thirties after...well let's just say a dark time had overtaken the world and leave it at that.  Suffice it to say, people weren't too keen on hospitals having their own crematoriums.

Moving to the right side, I found the door slightly ajar, and peering through it I found stacks upon stacks of pictures, records dating back to the thirties and forties, and suitcases stacked almost as high as the ceiling.  I was pawing through one of these suitcases when I heard something.  ""Get out."" A voice said over my shoulder. I quickly turned, shining my light around, but found no person standing there.   I kept searching, moving into the other room, only to hear a voice whisper in my ear ""Get out"" again.  This time more forceful, though not angry. Almost desperate.  ""I'm not leaving!"" I called back, turning my light around and seeking the source of the voice.  ""Get out. Now."" The voice said again, this time taking on a planitive tone. ""Please.""  it whispered.

""Doctor, is that you? Afraid I'll find your dirty little secret?!""  I never believed in ghosts, and while I didn't believe then, this was the only response that really made sense to me.  For all I knew, one of my friends was having a real go with me, and would laugh it up when I got back in the morning. No doubt word would be all over campus about how he made me think the ghost was real.  ""Not my doing."" The voice replied. ""Not my fault. ""Her..."" the voice said, trailing off. ""It wasn't my fault...""

Okay... this was starting to get creepy.  Creepy to the nth degree.  A wise man would have noped right out of there. I am not a wise man.  I'm not even a smart one.  The hairs stood on the back of my neck, and for a moment it seemed that the room had gotten colder. I could see my breath before me, and then quick as it had started, the feeling passed.  I shook my head to clear it, muttering something about hearing voices, and turned once more to the door.  Pulling on it again, I found that it came open easily, and silently. As though rolling on well greased wheels.  Looming up to nearly the height of the ceiling, a large brick furnace sat with a heavy iron door ajar. I didn't need a second glance to tell me that this was the old crematorium that had once sat in the basement.  Though why it was still present boggled my mind.  The only answer I could find then, lay in the fact that there was a second old door off one side of the room.  I figured that when the ideas of the world had changed, rather than just removing it, the hospital had bricked over the old entrance, and locked a door that led off a service hallway or stairs.  The door itself wouldn't budge, so I couldn't really confirm my theory, but I suspect I was correct just the same. 

Coming back around to the front, I raised my camera to take photos, only to stop in my tracks. There just in front of the brickwork, at a point where the tracks in the floor came to a stop, was a small girl.  She was maybe twelve years old, if that, and had thin blonde hair. She sat, hunched over, weeping into her hands.  Instinctively I reached out for her and found my arm went numb as it passed through her. The world around me seemed to change, and it was as if I was watching an old movie.  I felt as though I'd been yanked back to the past, and could watch this girl's final moments.  


I saw the girl being admitted into the hospital by her parents to be treated for the early stages of TB.  She was a sickly little child, and the parents had been promised by the doctor that they would do their best to save her.  She suffered in the hospital for two years, and was starting to get better, when late one night a nurse came to give her some medications.  Watching this, almost as though it were a movie, I could tell that the nurse was drunk.  I watched in horror as the nurse gave the girl the wrong medications, sending her into a deep coma.  When the girl did not awake the next morning, it was reported that the girl had died in the night. The doctor was visibly saddened by this, but signed the order, trusting the nurse's assesment.  The girl was then taken down into the basement by the nurse, and rather than let her 'accident' be brought to light, the nurse brought the girl in through a second hallway to the old furnace. I watched in frozen horror as she was placed in the furnace, and the door slammed shut behind her.  The ghost showed me that she did not go peacefully, but that she awoke to find herself in that brick furnace, and she screamed for help, banging on the metal of the door, only to have the roar of the flames rising around her drown out those screams for help.

Releasing me, the spirit stood before the oven, the place of her demise, the spirit turned away from me and looked into the gaping maw of the oven. ""I was not the first."" She said, her voice hollow and echoing through the inside of the oven. ""There were others she killed.  Others like me.""  Then darkness enveloped me and I remembered nothing.  Eventually I found myself in one of the wards, with the nurses tending me noting that I seemed to have suffered some kind of attack.  There were first and second degree burns on my face and arms, as though I'd stood too close to a great heat for too long.  I had been found sitting in the first floor of the old hospital, staring off into space.  Naturally the police were contacted, and I had to give them my statement.  The detective seemed more interested in the burns on my body than why I was in the hospital, prompting me to reluctantly tell him that he'd not believe me if I told him what I saw.  He however gave me a funny look and said ""try me.""  So I told the tale.  At first, he seemed shocked, but the more I spoke, the more he seemed to believe it.  At the end of it, he simply nodded and said he'd be in touch.

I left the college shortly after that, graduating and moving onto a bigger college for further education.  The old hospital always hung in the back of my head, though I never could explain what happened there.  About six years later, when visiting the college's hospital as part of a traveling nurse job (basically I go where I'm needed), I decided to give the detective a call.  We met after my shift ended, and he effectively closed the door on what I'd always wondered.

According to the detective, the hospital had suffered many strange incidents around the time the Nurse had been murdered.  People who were in the best of health suddenly dying, or bodies simply going missing.  While the doctor was using some very unorthodox, and questionable methods for treatment, some of those treatments were actually working.  That's why he was able to continue on for so long. Yes, people were suffering under his treatment, but at the time, the idea was that the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few.  The detective theorized that the doctor had figured out that the nurse was drinking on duty, and in doing so causing people to die; and what's more had taken to burning the bodies in the forgotten crematorium to hide her mistakes.  He believed that the Doctor confronted the nurse about this, and either suffered some kind of mental break, or just simply lost it in his anger, and murdered her.  The doctor had likely killed himself after this, being unable to live with what he had been blindly signing off on, or knowing he was at the very least party to multiple murders.  As to my events that night some six years prior, the Detective believed that one of the spirits had shown me what was going on in an effort to bring justice to their story.  

The one thing that stood out though, according to the detective, was my description of the girl.  Apparently, the girl who had reached out to me, was none other than the last victim, and the Head Doctor's own young sister.

I'm currently a junior, soon to be senior, enrolled in CS at a 4-year university.  I have a couple of internships and projects under my belt.  However, I feel slightly weak when it comes to passing more rigorous technical interviews.

I was wondering if you guys know any solid online tech interview courses, or know if I am better off learning with other tools. I don't have a huge background on data structures(my university lacks a data structures course...trust me, I know it's insane), so I was looking for something that would give me a decent understanding of data structures, and also teach me other fundamentals on how to pass a tech interview at the same time.

I'm mainly looking for online courses because I want to be on some sort of schedule, and taking a course will motivate me to be more productive...if that makes any sense lol.  I found this course from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/technical-interview--ud513). Let me know if I'm on the right track, or if I'm doing it completely wrong

6b58pw,3,2017-05-14,Suggest a laptop for a soft/hardware engineering student that travels a lot and has an eGPU,zero2g,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/6b58pw/suggest_a_laptop_for_a_softhardware_engineering/,"Basically my situation is that I travel quite a bit (I move from school to home to campus to internship/coop) and a desktop is definitely not a good idea for my anymore. What I did was I took out my GTX 1080 from my desktop and bought an eGPU to house it and using it with my current laptop.

Currently, my laptop is a XPS 15 9550 with i5. I will be using it for software development, gaming, general usage, deep learning training, and VMs.

My desired laptop would really be something that in shape and form like the XPS 15. But since I have an external GPU, graphics to me does not matter much as I can at least carry that around with me while travelling.

Basically, I would like a laptop that is 15 inch but have a nice and slim form factor that can last me with school and lectures. It should also have a good CPU to handle the tasks I am doing. A thunderbolt 3 x4 would really be nice if not required. Currently with my 9550, my 1080 is basically a 1060 or bit worse.

My budget is fairly high in this department because well... internships, so I am not really hesitant to maybe drop like 2k+ on something. However, I do wish that this set up can last me quite a while because I would much prefer this than having a desktop. If any extremely high power compute needs to be done, maybe I'll set up a desktop tower somewhere remote and send the data there.

Games and software I would be running:
*  Blade and Soul

*  OverWatch

*  Various AAA games

*  Visual Studios

*  Android Studios

*  VMWare/HyperV

*  Deep learning (Tensorflow, Torch, DIGITS, etc)

6b5pp1,7,2017-05-14,How strong of a candidate am I for an advanced degree in ecology or environmental science? (Graduating in a year with a B.S. in Environmental Science),curious_bio_student,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/6b5pp1/how_strong_of_a_candidate_am_i_for_an_advanced/,"**Student Background**

Hello, I'm a student at a state school in the midwest (USA).  I'll be graduating in a year with a degree in Environmental Science with a concentration in biology.  I was planning to apply for field biology positions, as well as lab positions and really anything I could get after graduating.  I've talked to several advisors and faculty members at my school and they think I have a good chance of getting a job after graduating because of the experience I have.

**Experience** 

I've assisted in a few research projects, and I have experience quantifying animal behavior from videos and also some experience identifying algae using microscopy.  I have experience with basic lab work, both chemical techniques like phosphorus analysis and ion chromatography and bio lab work like weighing/measuring/identifying plants.  I worked with another student on a 9 month project looking at land use, environmental variables (P, N concentrations and ratios), and algal blooms.  We presented that at our undergraduate symposium and we are hoping to publish a paper on our work. (not 100% sure if we will be able to, but we're trying).  

I'm spending the summer assisting an ecology professor.  I'll be doing some lab work but mainly learning R and trying to learn how to analyze previously collected ecological data sets, hopefully forming my own hypothesis after analyzing data and reading relevant literature.  Its an on going project.  I also have a part-time unpaid internship quantifying stream depth, vegetation cover, and other variables for a local non-profit watershed council.  I'll also gain a bit of experience doing education/outreach with school groups through that internship, and hopefully further my GIS skills. 

By the time I graduate, I will have hopefully presented again at our undergraduate symposium, presenting the work I'm doing this summer (which will continue into the fall and perhaps longer) with the ecology professor I mentioned.  There is a good chance I'll have experience doing snake surveys by then as well.  

I need one more research credit or internship to graduate as well, and I'll hopefully be interning at a consulting agency or government agency. (I'm not 100% sure what exactly I want to do with my life, so hopefully I can contrast non-profit work with government or private sector work to give myself some direction).

I feel like I have a good amount of experience and strong references and I think I have a good chance of getting a job after I graduate. 

**Why I'm writing this post** 

However, I was talking to a few professors recently, and I've been strongly encouraged to apply for graduate school and phd programs, and I've started to consider going straight into a program instead of working for a few years first (my previous plan) 

I'm writing this extremely long post today to try and figure out how strong of a candidate I'd be for grad school or a phd program.  I have a meeting with an advisor in a week, but I figure it can't hurt to get as many perspectives as possible.

**Important Info**

I'd want a higher degree in ecology, environmental science, or conservation biology

I'm interested in things like using biology/ecology to understand environmental threats to human populations and using biology/ecology to understand effects of climate change and other human-related issues on natural and human systems.  I'm interested in urban environments, or environments that have been modified by humans.  I'm really interested in a concept I came across called reconciliation ecology, don't know how realistic it is to study that.  

My school is not well known and isn't prestigious or hard to get into.  However, the bio department is one of the largest, and considered one of the better programs at our school.  Our environmental science program is young but is science based and is a B.S., I take mostly science classes.  A plurality of my credits are biology.

My GPA upon graduation will be 3.40-3.50.  My grades were worst as a freshman, and have gotten better every year.  Got a 3.83 and 3.97 the two most recent semesters.  My major GPA is higher than my overall GPA. 

I will be able to get at least three strong recommendation letters from professors and (internship) supervisors I've worked with closely.  

Like I mentioned above, I have a lot of research experience and will have done two internships (one field work, one TBD) upon graduation.  Will have possibly published a research paper.  

**One last piece of really important info**

I'm from a big-ish city (40-70th biggest in the USA) and went to college in a small town.  I really want to get back to a bigger city, and the dream is to move to New York City to join some family that has moved there.  If not NYC, I'd really like to move to a larger city in the USA or abroad, if that is a possibility.  I know everyone wants to live in places like these, making schools more competitive, but that is what I really want to do if possible.  

**How strong of a candidate am I for a Masters Program or PhD program in a larger city in the USA or another English speaking country?**

Also, might as well ask, how strong of a candidate am I for jobs upon graduating?  What kind of jobs come to mind? (I know this is kind of a generic question?

Any suggestions for programs/schools I should look into?

Anyone who read all the way through this and tried to answer some of my questions, THANK YOU so much! I'm trying to figure out my future and hearing from other people in related fields offers me great perspective.  

**Tl;dr:  Student, soon to get B.S., details his past experience, grades, and potential ideas for what to do after graduation.  Asks how strong of a candidate he is for grad/phD programs, thanks readers for answering questions :)**"

So of course summer is approaching and lots of people are beginning to apply for internships, volunteering opportunities, and other extracurriculars over the summer. I live in a fairly wealthy area, so lots of people have connections through their parents or other family members to take internships or shadow people in their field, while others have their parents pay thousands of dollars for pre-collegiate programs. My family isn't very wealthy, so we can't afford these programs, and we are immigrants, so my parents don't have many connections for internships.

Another problem I see is that most extracurriculars over the summer are focused around STEM or engineering while I am interested in business, and more specifically, finance, which I am not finding many opportunities to work on except through school clubs.

I applied for the position months ago, saw the same company at a job fair at my school and discussed the internship with them and asked them if they could review my application.

Month or so later they call me with an offer. Didn't get to do an on-site interview. So I don't really know what to expect, also have a lot of questions.

The person who directs the interns says that the orientation day will cover all of the things that we have questions about (dress code, schedule, etc). So I didn't want to bug her with my 100 questions over email. 

Have any of you been an ""IT intern""? If so what did you usually do? Was it more of a learning experience than actually doing things?

I’m having issues conversing with family or being around other people.

Background:

I was a CS major before switching to Computer Informatics in my SENIOR year. Now I have two years left till graduation in a major I have zero knowledge of and don’t know what the degree leads to since it was the closest degree of my interest and credits transferring wise.
 
Some people are telling me to take it slow and some are saying to push through because a degree will help you get a job and it might get better from there.

Right Now:

I’m currently in summer break applying to some internships (which I’m not stressed if I’m not accepted). I’m also trying to work on coding and other computer related subjects in the field. My main issue is I can’t even look at code anymore: it stresses, tires, and frustrates me to no extent nowadays. Every time I’m trying to learn something new, I get frustrated and my head gets clouded with anger. I can’t concentrate, I can’t focus. I’m completely burnt out and un-disciplined. I want to work, learn, and succeed but I feel too fatigued (maybe b/c I want results fast). 

My GPA has fallen a lot but its not completely ruined. Currently at 2.95. I try going to the gym or other distractions but I’m constantly thinking about work, college, and my future.

** After I tried to work on a simple Bootstrap site with a tutorial and could not get it done, I slept the last 18 / 24 hours in. 

TL;DR: I really need help trying to clear my head. Thinking about going to a counselor to talk out my problems. Any previous advice to de-stress would be awesome.

This is basically a vent but I would love help."

I just want to share what i am going through. May be i would get some helpful replies. I am 26 now. Finished bachelor in CSE about 2 years ago from a 3rd world country. Worked as an intern as web developer at a bank. Then i came to the US on GC with my family. There were so many obstacles that i need to overcome. I had to support my family here, i was committed to a girl who was waiting for me back in my country. US culture, language were new to me. It was hard to get used to everything for me. I started odd jobs at different restaurants, was going double shifts to make enough money to carry everyone with me. I kept doing that for more than a year. At a point i got so frustrated doing all those odd things overnights. I met someone who pushed me, he said you have passion in IT i know you can find better job, better life in US. So he brought me to an indian IT agency who place people in Software Quality Assurance job. I went to them and start getting their training and they placed me on a contract position, though they sent me on a fake resume(its a very common story in IT here). I was not accepting to work on something fake but i think ok atleast after all of that i might get a career  in IT what i always wanted. After 5 months the contract finished i lost the job. Then i went back and get married because i couldn't make her waiting for me anymore due to her family issues. Now i came back in NY and thought ok now i have sone real experience i can find something with genuine skill, I won't need to show fake anymore? I prepared resume with whatever i achieve my own. I went to some stuffing agencies. Trying​ hard to find atleast an interview on entry positions from indeed, dice, monster and some direct employer website. No responses. I am passionate about programing, i love to play with tools, i understand different applications. I am sensible, hard working, passionate. I understand to get a job i need to strong portfolio. But how can i make good profile if i can't start at somewhere for a long period of time. In IT training institutes who offers good training and guarantied job, either i have to spend 15 20 grands for bootcamps or indian agencies who just place on fake resume and short contract. Most of the job requirements they ask for certain year experience in certain tools. But can one's skills be measured by how many years he worked. So very first one got disqualified due to not having certain years of experience. Anyway, i am so frustrated​ due to facing all of these. how can i overcome these?"

It's not just a ""reasonably low starting salary""- it's completely out of/below the entire range of pay you'd see for this entry level position, completely below any pay I received even for undergraduate internships that were in the same field/position type but lower level. This is a position requiring years of experience, a four year degree, or a combination of the two. I have a BSc from a highly ranked Uni in a major directly related to my field of work, a very strong academic record, and a couple of years of relevant experience (still basically at entry level). This is all excluding the fact that I've just received certification that's extremely relevant to my current position and, in competing positions, is sometimes a requirement or at least bumps up my value significantly. My point is not that all this should guarantee any particular pay level, but only that it's pretty inarguable that my compensation level is not even close to competitive. For reference, pay increases at my company are yearly and a very low percentage.


**Here are the facts:**

* Started this job about half a year ago. Before you ask, yes I did attempt to negotiate and I ended up taking this pay more because I really, really needed a job (unemployed at the time) and I really liked the company's culture/team. I wanted to see if I'd like the work and how I'd feel about the obviously low pay a few months in. Yes, I look only to the mirror for the blame for my predicament, but I don't regret giving this a shot.
* I work on a small team. We all generally hold the same title/responsibility level. I don't know their salaries and I wouldn't ask but I know, without having to do much detective work, they feel as equally underpaid.
* I really enjoy my job. It's not without its stress and it's maybe not what I see myself doing for another 10-20 years but it's a perfect spot for me right now. I'm a great culture fit, I'm intrinsically motivated (most of the time), and I love my coworkers/team (most of the time). I know for a fact that it's the best fit I've ever had in my career thus far.
* I've been frequently told by my manager and coworkers that I'm excelling in performance and aptitude and thus far I've had no disciplinary nor personal issues with the job.
* I've been interviewing with other companies, taking time off whenever I can without hurting my productivity, and I have competing offers for significantly more pay. I may not want to leave, but I have the leverage/back-up plan in case I decide I should just hop ships. 
* I have, using real income statement data for our particular office and actual revenue/expense numbers for the exact work I've done, calculated how much profit this company has received from my particular contributions in one of the first months I worked here. When compared to how much money they've spent on me for wages, I as an employee have a very high return on investment (over 200%) that I know a less qualified, less motivated replacement (should I leave) would not bring. This calculation, along with every element of accurate data (taken from the company's reports themselves), is organized into an interactive and presentable spreadsheet workbook. It displays my current extremely high personal ROI, due to my high earning revenue for the company yet low pay, and some hypothetical higher pay rates for me that would be more market value-level but still yield a 100+% ROI. This is considering that this sort of ROI is only to get higher as my wages stay where they are and my revenue contributions increase with experience.



**Here's my point:**

I want to try to convince upper management that, with all the above elements, I'm worth an actual salary renegotiation. I know it's a shot in the dark, I know it's a rare occurance at most companies, but I feel I have a convincing argument. Letting me walk or firing me would leave a *large* abandoned work load that the company would not easily handle until a replacement is found and trained to my level to handle- one that would leave for better pay if they honestly do have my qualifications. I have the spreadsheet workbook, I have the proof I hit numbers so high that this company could double my salary and profit off of me yet, I have the back-up offer. I'm here asking for advice/tips on how to handle this meeting, how to bring this up, points to emphasize, mistakes to avoid, etc. and, better yet, if this seems like a good idea at all (some would argue it's better to just walk and forget it, which I would if I didn't love this job so much). Any help is much appreciated!

Actually, not many from my class got BB IB internships this year despite my school being well represented on the street. An OK amount of students got IB internships at boutiques and middle-market firms, and many of those who got BB IB internships settled for ancillary roles (not the hottest product/industry groups or in quasi-front office roles). Those not in banking took other positions in finance and some took internships in industries like tech.

* Northeast Target
  
* Finance Major
  
* Semi-competitive GPA
  
* Decent internship experience
  
I'm mainly writing this thread to try and give back to the community and answer any questions about the recruiting process. Although I didn't actually succeed in securing an IB internship, I did enough interviews/networking/preparing to feel that I can at least offer some half-decent advice to people looking to break into the industry. At the very least, I hope this thread serves to dismiss the myth that ""all target kids who want banking, get banking.""

6b90nd,2,2017-05-15,Transfer process and Insights on Visual Arts - Media program (Transfer admitted student),naytokay31,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6b90nd/transfer_process_and_insights_on_visual_arts/,"Hey!
I'm a transfer student from the Inland Empire area. I have some questions and curiosity geared towards the transfer process, living in campus as a transfer, and the Visual Arts program. I have wayyy more questions, but I'm gonna save that until I make the decision to go there or not.
 I got accepted to UC San Diego for the Visual arts - media major and Sixth college. I also got accepted to UC Irvine for the Art major and UCR for Theatre, Film, and Digital Production. I got rejected from UCLA for their Design/Media Arts program. I live about 15 mins away from UCR, but most likely gonna be passing it up so I'm choosing between UCI and UCSD at the moment. My main career goal is to become an animator/filmmaker, get my bachelor's in whatever school I end up going to these next 2 years, and I'm planning to pursue graduate studies afterward, so I would like to know if by going to UCSD would help me out with that process.

Between UCI and UCSD, my parents would prefer me to choose Irvine merely because of financial reasonings and by this case they want me to commute by train from the IE to UCI daily since there's an IE/OC line to Tustin and a bus from there that stops in front of UCI. Yes I know it sounds crazy cuz it's gonna take a lot of time, but it's what they prefer and it's a money saver cuz I heard it's expensive renting near UCI. HOWEVER, if I do choose UCSD I will live there no doubt about it. I'm trying to convince them as much as possible if I can live independently so I would like to know what it's like living in UCSD (I heard about ""the Village"" for transfers and I would like some insights on that place) and what the rent costs is like and all that stuff.

When I applied to San Diego, I didn't really do much research on the Visual Arts - Media program. So I'm wondering if anyone could give me any insights/reviews about the program or the whole visual arts program in general. How will the program build up my portfolio? I know i said that my main career goal is to become an animator, but I don't mind becoming one just yet. I want to pursue any career, internship, path that will help me guide towards my goal into becoming an animator, and a Master's in Animation is in my list of goals as well.

For the transfer process, I just wanna know the transitions between being in a semester system to quarter system and also what it's like being out in UCSD. What are the trendy places/things to do around the area. How's the social scene and all that. (Yes I've heard about UCSD being a ""socially dead"" school, but I'd like to hear out some stuff about that lol). I dont really go to San Diego often. I don't know much about the school, I've never even been to UCSD at all. However, i don't want to pass up a school just because I've never been there, financial reasonings, or not knowing what opportunities would lie ahead if I go there. I want to be able to give my last word before I make the decision between UCI and UCSD. I don't want to have the awful feeling of asking myself ""what if I went to UCSD instead of UCI?"" Or vice Versa.
Either way, I know my family will support my decision. I've always wanted to attend a school out of the county, experience living independently, or by having a change in environment especially since I've been having some friend drama lately and I just want to be away from it or just make myself more busy. For UCI, I'm getting used to the campus and area a little, but for some reason I'm getting this weird sense that I might not fit in with the school as well as the program. I feel like I won't be doing much in the Art program there. I went to UCI's transfer celebration day and I was the only one in the group focused on just Art while the rest were in drama. And when I saw the course list, I wasn't all too impressed either. I wasn't able to attend Triton transfer day cuz I had no one to take me :( 
But hopefully I'll be able to visit UCSD sometime these next two weeks and give my last word/impression on it before the deadline to commit. I like both schools in general, but we'll see what will happen :) I'll give whatever it takes to get thru these next 2 years.
I know I had more stuff in mind, but I'm gonna leave it at that.

Anyways thanks! And if you have any advice or other insights about UCSD and the transfer process just lmk."

I don't really know any details yet, but is it possible to switch teams as an intern? 

Does anyone have any experience/advice to go about this - in the case that I do decide to try and switch even after learning more about the details?

edit; adding what was originally a comment to the post: 

Thanks for the reply everyone. I've actually done some similar type of work in computational biology as an undergraduate researcher - which is possibly why I was placed on devops - and is something that I want to move away from. Nothing against devops - It's just I feel I would be more interested in the type of work if I wasn't on devops. It doesn't help that I'm not too fond of python/scripting and would much much rather be working in a functional/static language like scala. But these are just my first impressions... I'll probably reach out to see if anything is possible...

Also is it standard practice to assign interns to teams with no input/survey? And for my case devops team seems to be a big leap from something like backend development with scala/play - which is what the position description described as well.

I am preparing to apply for the upcoming application for HBS 2+2. It is probably a long shot, but I thought I might as well apply and I was hoping to get some feedback on how my profile is shaping up.

**Academics**

- Rising Senior at top-ish liberal arts school (top 3 academic rigor, rising in all other rankings) with a Business, 
   Organizations, and Society (Liberal Arts Business) and Computer Science double major.

- Board Member for school's financial allocation board (allocates money for all student clubs)
- Founder-president consulting club and entrepreneurship club.
- VP Senior Honor Society. 
- Also served as RA for 3 years.
- Currently working with my school to establish an incubator on-campus

**Work Experience** 

- Internships at two early stage technology startups in strategy/growth role.

**Why MBA?**

This is the hardest for me to articulate. But primarily because I want to leverage my passion for technology and business but switching to the other side of the fence - from entrepreneurship to VC/PE. I need to refine this.

Would love to get feedback on what I could work on/improve/ general gut feeling on my chances.

I'm a sophomore CS major at a top 5 school for CS, but as an international student, I only started programming properly once I got to college. In this process, I've realized that the field is significantly broader than what it seems to be from the outside, and so, I've been strongly considering taking a year off to try and intern at a few different companies working in a range of areas (eg: web dev / game dev / systems software), and then doing research over the summer, to hopefully zero in to what I find most interesting. Part of the upside I see for this would be that I'd be better equipped to make the most of my time at college, by focussing on taking more classes in those areas.

Most of my friends/advisers seem to like this idea, but one of them pointed out the possibility of future employers thinking of it as a down-side, and taking it to mean that I might have a low stress tolerance. What are your thoughts on this idea, and do you think the employer-issue is a valid/likely concern? Thanks!"

i am only living for my cat. i am comforted by telling myself that once she is gone, i can go too. but at the same time i know somebody else could take much better care of her and she would be so much happier living somehwere else and i could go then as well.

i am more depressed and anxious and whatever the hell else than i have ever been in y life. i live in a mentally and emotionally abusive household and i need out but there is so much wrong with me that i stay and constantly walk on eggshells because i know it could be much much worse and i'm terrified of things changing in general. we have a new living room floor and it makes me want to cry. the fireplace is getting new veneer stone and it's the ugliest thing i've ever seen even though i know it looks fine. i can't handle thinking about moving out and having my own life even though i would love to go to college and have a good job and a family but i can't leave my house because everything overwhelms me and i shut down too easy. my mother used to do everything for me like making appointments and getting me out of the house but lately she's been treating me differently and i don't blame her because i'm awful to deal with but, uh, i'm gonna be shitty and honest and admit i snooped on her fb a little and i know it was wrong and i wish i hadn't but her sister is upset about how i acted at dinner a few days ago and how she doesn't want to see me anymore and my mom said she understood and agreed but i don;t know what i did? and i can't ask because i'd have to admit to snooping but this really messed me up. 

i know i need out of this house and to go far away and never have to deal with any of these people again but i'm not good at being a person. i need somebody to hold my hand and tell me what to do  and help me with everything but i don't have anybody anymore. i need to be taken care of and babied and be treated so gently. i know i am too sensitive and i get grumpy sometimes but i try so hard to be a good person and i can't work on fixing my mistakes if i don;t know i've made them.

i have a doctors app on the 24th and i'm going to talk to her about maybe upping my medicine dose and ,maybe find out if there's anything else i can do for now. i really liked speaking with a therapist when i was younger and i really liked mine specifically but it turned out she was just doing an internship at that office and i didn't really feel comfy with anybody else there and i sort of just? gave it up because i was ovrerwhelmed by it and i though i was doing okay anyway. in hs i asked my mom to help me get back into it but she didn't really seem to care so for now i'm gonna talk to my dr and see what i can do because i don't think i really want to die i just don't know what to do right now. 

i'm sorry this is long and rambly and that you read it all but i just have a lot i'm worrying about right now and i don't know where else to go. "

Fairly soon I will be a graduate of a 3 year computer programmer analyst technical diploma program at Niagara College up here in Canada.  I have attended less than 5% of my classes, my GPA is of course a little lacking though I fully understand the content.  I'm not too sure how the program/school is seen by employers.  The course was way too easy, though has a fairly high failure rate.

I got a co op (intern) position in a non programming field as a PC Technician as I liked the look of the company and I've always liked the more hands on stuff (at times).

I'm great with C#, that was the main focus of my program.  Great with SQL.  I'm good with HTML/CSS and alright with Javascript.  I've messed around with Python and PHP.

I'm thinking about where I should go from here? I've been taking IBMs Big Data University courses as Hadoop interested me.  I've also looked at some Coursera programs as they offer some Javascript stuff and as I said I'm only alright.

It’s been almost one year since she got this job and ever since it seems that she gave up on life, she just ""exists"" now, she doesn't want to finish college anymore, she doesn't want to go to the gym anymore, she just want to watch netflix, stay at home and ""rest"". It seems as she doesn't want do anything anymore. 

* Recently (about 2 weeks ago) she tried to get a transfer to the city that I live, so we could have a life together, but that was denied(but we have other options in the near future), after that it got even worse, she doesn't talk to me as much, she doesn't want to go to her english classes anymore. Even though I try to be uplifting and complacent about her situation (and try to see from her point of view), every time I mention how we should work together to change it and make things better she just ""ignores"" me and don't respond (it's her self defense mechanism), sometimes I send her many options and ways that I can try help her, but she doesn't respond. When I try to talk her about it she says she is not in the mood, or she is tired or some other excuse. It seems like she is running away from responsibility, and living this miserable life is now good enough for her. She is not remotely happy, but now she just want to stay put, and wait for life to be over it seems.

* I don't want to break up with her but lately is getting worse and worse, she is getting colder, more distant, and it seems like she is losing interest in life and in our relationship, just waiting for the time to pass. All of this is making me miserable, I can take and fight bad things when they come my way no problem, but when I see her suffering and can't help, or she won't let me help, I feel like I'm a useless junk and can't defend what I love the most.

* ps: she doesn't like to talk about her feelings, even when I try my best to make her trust me and feel secure and loved. she always has been this way, like she is protecting herself from the world, even from me (that makes me very sad and I said it to her).

* ps2: her mother is a very negative and bitter person (believe me she is bitter as hell), and she's always picking on my girlfriend and making her feel insecure about herself, she doesn't receive almost any love from her mother, and constantly is said that at her age she should've already moved out. I disgust her mother to say the least. But even so she listens more to what her mother has to say than she listens to me.

* ps3: I'm always very positive, and always try to uplift her spirit, even when things are bad, I always try my very best to make her feel loved, and to know that I'm always here for her. I'm not jealous in any way, I'm super chill, and always think what is best for her even when it sometimes means I get the bad part of the deal, or get myself hurt.

* ps4: we have this relationship about 3 years, we lived in the same city about 1 year, after that I had to move to another city to get my masters degree. So in the last 2 years we talk everyday by messages (she doesn't like to talk on the phone) and we skype about once a month (and that makes me a little sad as well, that I don't hear her voice as often). About 4 times a year I go back to her city and spend a week or so with her.

* ps5: sorry for my awful English;

I'm from Wisconsin and I recently started an internship for a small technology company in my college town in Wisconsin. I'm mostly doing marketing stuff for them. Although this opportunity is wonderful and relatively close to home, I don't find much enjoyment out of it and it doesn't coincide with my major (management).

I applied for an internship in Atlanta for the summer back in March as my old boss now works there and asked me to apply for an internship she is offering. I got an email from her today informally offering me the position for the summer. This opportunity coincides more with my major and seems like something I would enjoy more, but is much further from home.

To recapitulate my thoughts:

Wisconsin job
Pros: Close to home.
Already paying for a place there. 

Cons: Don't enjoy it.
Not entirely related to my major.

Georgia job
Pros: Related to my major.
Love my old boss.
Chance at more independence.

Cons: Will have to pay for housing in the summer on top of my apartment back home.
Very far from home.



Financially, my parents are ultra supportive and will help me if I need it, but I hate asking them for help as they've already done so much for me. 

The pay for both jobs is about the same.

I think I'm leaning towards Georgia, but would like some other opinions.

My question is whether I should look for an internship during the fall/spring of next year, which would mean graduating a semester later, or just graduate as quickly as possible. I have some decent side projects, but is that enough for businesses to consider me, or are they more focused on applicants with internship experience? I considered looking for an internship after graduation, but I heard that's generally a bad idea. Thanks in advance."

They left a simple but heartfelt announcement of my death on my ‘wall’ and a link to the news story describing what happened. But allow me to rewind. 

I went home for the summer after my freshman year of college came to a close. While I had desired to stay in the college town, working an internship, my parents had absolutely forbade it. Even my friends who lived in town insisted that I rest back in my countryside hometown. I had been frustrated and angry but understanding. After all, they had just wanted the best for me. But at least Nora, Sam, and Randy all promised that they would keep in touch with me. 

It had been a stressful two semesters; during the first I suffered from extreme anxiety and depressive episodes, and during the second a close friend of mine named Wendy committed suicide. I had found her, limp and unmoving, in her single dorm. She hadn’t locked the door. To say I was shaken was an understatement, the ‘episodes’ became never ending. I was attending therapy twice a week, and my parents and friends were all overly concerned about me. So I guess it made sense that everyone insisted that I go back to my happy comfortable home. 

But when the first month passed at a snail’s pace, I decided that I was mentally sound enough to begin working and actually leaving the house. A local florist's’ shop hired me (not on my merit, but because the owner was close with my grandmother), and I spent the majority of my free time in the cool back room, arranging flowers and listening to the local classical radio station. I didn’t talk often, other than during my therapy sessions or when I got lunch with the friend who had remained at home to care for her sick mom. 

All in all, I felt that my anxiety was well under control and that my depression was fairly manageable with the pills I was taking. I went jogging in the early morning before work, I cooked dinner for my parents, and I often messaged a group chat of the friends who lived back in our college town. So after careful consideration and a lot of debate, my parents decided I would be allowed to visit my friends back up by my university. It was a three hour drive, but I was always a good driver, and I never broke any laws. 

When I told Randy that I could visit, he and the others decided to throw a barbeque to commemorate all of us being together again. So in the clear morning sun, around eight AM, I pulled out of my driveway and started off northward. The first two hours were fine, the roads were clear, my favorite music played over the speakers, filling my car with energy. I loved driving with my windows down. I tapped my fingers on the steering wheel, my many rings (I always wore at least three, ridiculous I know) clacking with the beat. I was wearing my favorite sundress, doing everything in my power to make myself feel good. 

With about fifty miles of hills between myself and my destination, I began to feel nauseous. My vision blurred, and before I knew it, I was drifting into the other lane. A blaring car horn snapped me out of my daze, and I quickly pulled onto a back road, where I parked on the shoulder. I stumbled out of my car, making sure my keys were in my hand, and I collapsed into the ditch. I felt as if I were about to throw up. Every movement I made caused me to feel faint. So I put my head between my knees and I focused on my breathing. 

The moment I felt better I stood back up, noting the way clouds had come over the sun, and I got back into my vehicle. My phone had died at seventy two percent, but it was three years old and I had dropped it in a creek during a nature hike a week earlier. I didn’t think anything about it, and I kept driving, feeling relieved when I reached the town. My little roadside stop had only cost me about thirty minutes of time, and I hoped that my friends weren’t annoyed with my tardiness. I never was late to anything. 

I pulled my car to a stop in front of my friend’s rental house- Sam, Nora, and Randy lived together just off campus. There were less people there than I anticipated; only three other cars. I had been expecting at least five, but maybe I wasn’t the only late one. That thought brought a smile to my face. At least I wouldn’t be receiving the most mocking over burgers and chips. My mouth was watering, and I realized I was more hungry than I had initially thought. 

Our group rarely bothered with formalities, and they tended to leave the door unlocked during the day, so I let myself in. First I noticed that the room was oddly quiet, and a somber air hung over it. Six people were sitting around the living room, all wearing dark clothing with red rimmed eyes.There were many empty bottles sitting around, I felt cold suddenly, sick just like I had on the side of the road an hour earlier. 

“God, who died?” I asked, half joking, half horrified that something had happened. Nora looked up and promptly screamed. The rest of the room turned to look at me, all of them reacting in a slightly different way. Sam stood and ran to me, grabbing my face and rubbing my shoulders, Randy was yelling, trying to quiet the rest of the room, who were in various stages of uproar. Evan was shaking his head in disbelief, Kalie was crying hard, and Stevie couldn’t stop staring. Two more of my friends ran from the kitchen, adding to the screams of confusion. I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening. 

And then they sat me down on the couch, and with no small amount of tears and panic they explained. I had died yesterday. It was on the internet, and on the news. My parents had identified my body at the coroner's at seven the night before. Funeral invitations had been sent out, my body was being buried the next day. The reason my friends were together was because they were mourning me, because I was dead. I hadn’t been on the side of the road for half an hour, it had been a full day. 

At nine in the morning in my sleepy hometown, police were called by onlookers who witnessed a woman jumping from the local bridge and into the shallow river beneath it. She had on my favorite sundress, the one I wear now. She had on five rings, the same I wear now. Her hair was the same cut and color as mine. Her face was my own. The birthmark on her hip is identical to mine. 

I don’t know what this means. I don’t know who she is- I had no sibling, my mother had only been pregnant once. I was her only child. When I called my parents (after charging my phone) they didn’t believe it was me. They thought I was pranking them, a cruel joke from a stranger who wanted them to suffer. But when I insisted on things only I would know, said things that only I would say, they started to believe me. And within three hours, they were at the house with my friends, all who were questioning everything they knew, questioning what had happened in that day I was on the side of the road. 

Police came and spoke to me, took me from my friends. I tried to explain what had happened. I couldn’t. I tried to understand, but I couldn’t. I cannot figure out who the woman was. Her body was gone from the coroner’s office. My parents were given money from the state to stay quiet, to not sue them for unneeded emotional distress (I had never understood that part). But I can’t help but wonder why these things were covered up so quickly, not investigated or questioned. 

I have this fear. This fear that I am a double, that I am not actually the girl I think I am. My memories are consistently hazy, I can only vaguely recall important details, but enough to feel like I’m close with my friends and family. They’re all happy that I’m no longer depressed, happy that I’ve turned a new leaf. But what if I didn’t? What if I am merely a double? Brought into the world in the last few months, the real me dead? It would make more sense for me to kill myself than for me to suddenly feel better, right? Or maybe the pills have been making me hazy, and I’m just being paranoid. It makes me think of Wendy, and I wonder if she’s alive out there, in some different universe or in our own. 

Because either way, something went wrong, a glitch in time or a tear in reality. Thinking of anything more sinister will kill me. 

That is, unless I’ve already died.

I am a high school junior, and have very few volunteering hours (~13 total).

-self-taught musician 

-early graduation &amp; college credits from a local community college

-a couple small clubs

-National Hispanic Scholar

Is it essential that I get more volunteering hours, or is just a commitment to my internship enough as far as hours even if it's not volunteering?

Just in case it matters, I am a hispanic/mixed race girl who wants to major in computer science with 3.9 unweighted GPA and 1510 SAT.

I got through the first couple classes with a C- and a C but I ended up dropping one of my classes and failing the other this semester. I'm 25% of the way though the major but now i'll only be allowed to retake two more classes after this, so i don't feel comfortable taking this gamble. 

I am thinking of changing my major to GIS because i feel more confident passing that and it is somewhat related, but I wanted to ask if there were any other majors that would be more suitable in helping me find a CS job when i graduate.

Also, what other actions should i take to help me find an internship. I was planning on doing side projects this summer, so i can add them to my portfolio as I apply to internships during the fall/spring, but will I be able to find an internship with my grades and the fact that i'm not going to be in CS anymore?

I'm sorry if this was hard to follow in any way. I've been having a hard time wrapping my head around leaving CS.

So the main questions are:

1. What are the most helpful backup majors for someone who wants to pursue computer science?

2. What should I do to ensure getting an internship and, eventually, a job in CS? I'm still going to do the side projects and definitely aim for better grades, but if there is anything else, please suggest them to me. "

I was recently hospitalized (my first time in the hospital) for it, but found that during my time there, I started gaining more hope about different treatments and relaxing a great deal more. In my time since I've been out, I've been spending a lot more time doing fun activities. I started a stressful job, but I've been compensating with stress management initiatives. I was depressed about 1 out of every 10 days for a while after I got out, but it's increased to about 1 out of every 5 days. Today, I got suicidal to the point that I didn't tell my boyfriend and planned not to, thinking I'd probably do it, until he nearly hurt himself slipping off a stair and it jarred me out of my state into a more empathetic one.

Will I ever stop wanting to kill myself? I got to 8 on this scale today:

0 – No thoughts of suicide. The word suicide doesn’t even enter your head unless provoked. This is how your average person feels about suicide.
1 – Occasional thoughts of suicide. Suicidal thoughts are not frequent and suicidal thoughts don’t cause distress. Thoughts of suicide are mostly academic.
2 – Thoughts of suicide start to become more frequent and begin to feel more personal.
3 – Suicidal thoughts are frequent and are sometimes accompanied by the feeling you might actually commit suicide. Sometimes you feel you want to die.
4 – Thoughts of suicide are frequent and you consistently feel like you want to die.
5 – Thoughts of suicide occur every day. Almost everything reminds you of suicide and death.
6 – Thoughts of suicide, death and dying occur every day and cause you great distress.
7 – You’re obsessed with thoughts of suicide, dying and you start making a plan on how to commit suicide. You have a strong desire to die / end suffering.
8 – You begin putting your suicide plan into place; you are convinced you will commit suicide. You feel you have nothing to live for / others would be better without you.
9 – You write a suicide note and say goodbye to the people in your life. You might feel a sense of relief knowing that you will soon be dead. You might give away your possessions.
10 – You’re in the midst of implementing your plan for suicide. You’re determined to commit suicide

I've never been that high before. I don't have any sort of plan to get to lower levels. My efforts haven't worked. I can find a new psychiatrist who actually calls me back. I can talk to my therapist about how I've been feeling misunderstood. I can let go of the friends of mine who aren't there for me. I can try more positive self-talk. Other than that, I don't know what to do. I already use Happify, I meditate, I work out, I get a good night's sleep, I go to trauma therapy, I do hobbies, I do DBT, I spend time with my boyfriend, I socialize, but I just feel SO hopeless. I know quitting my stressful internship would help, but I am NOT OK with not reaching my dreams and being dependent on others; I am too goal oriented and passionate.

What should I do? I don't want my depression to hurt my loved ones anymore, as it does when I become suicidal. I don't want it to hurt me anymore either. I feel helpless. Should I continue on the same medication since it did reduce my depression, even if it's not enough? Is that even safe if I still want to end my life so strongly so often? What else can I do, and what should I do in the mean time if it's long-term things?

Thank you."

I am a male, junior and rising senior, family income between $90k-100k, 4 children, not struggling but not well-off. I'm the only kid in my family who has ever taken a rigorous class. My parents, although supportive of me, are really just happy with me passing classes. I know it's not an excuse, but everything I've done has been done alone. I don't have a tiger mom threatening to kill me if I don't make straight A's.. Or B's.. Or C's... Ok maybe C's. Let me share something that my counselor says will help in college admissions: From kindergarten through halfway through freshman year, I took normal level classes because that's all I ever knew. I didn't even know what honors classes were. I became friends with my history teacher, and she recommended that I take AP/honors classes and apply to the Air Force Academy(my family is filled with veterans). I would've been the first to make it into a service academy, or even be a Commissioned Officer at that. So I did that, and have nearly made straight A's. All honors classes besides world history(9th), english I(9th), and the electives. While I do exercise on my own time, I don't play sports. I have played trumpet in band for 6 years now, tried out for clinics 2 years now but haven't made it unfortunately. I took on a formal leadership role in my school's marching band this past year. I was second in command of 122 students ranging from 9th-12th grade. For those who aren't in band, my job as drum major is to: conduct the ensemble on-field and in the stands, organize and coordinate the rest of the leadership team(27 people), print and distribute music, oversee all duties of all other leadership team members, and of course... lead band members. I have worked at an ice cream parlor for roughly a month now and have begun discussing moving up with my manager already. We talk about finances a lot. 

I received a B in CP english I, honors english II, AP Lit, a C in honors precal(Totally my fault, girlfriend stuff, I could have EASILY made a B), and Spanish I(again, stupid mistake. Everything I turned in was an A, but I left every Friday to prepare for marching band trips to football games. I said I'd make up the work but never did. So yeah). Right now my schedule is: honors anatomy, spanish II, AP US history, band, and AP physics I(Alg based). I will receive an A in all but APUSH(B). Unweighted GPA: 3.65, Weighted: 3.93(remember, the two C's. Before those, it was 4.25... I know, I screwed up). I took the ACT for the first time this March, 27 composite. I WILL be taking it at LEAST two more times(this June and August). I know that I am capable of getting a 32, it was stupid mistakes!! Perfect example, I forgot everything about probability which was 7 questions I believe on the math test. I just finished signing up for dual enrollment classes that I'll take over this summer: european history and statistcs. These are both weighted as AP classes, so that'll bump my GPA to almost a 4.1 before my senior year starts. All AP classes next year. Full year AP Calc and semester of physics C to name two classes. I was just named a drum major for the second year in a row and will begin coordinating with the other drum major next week. 

I will be joining the Spanish club very soon, equality club, and will be creating my own club.. I want your guys' advice on it. My idea was to get all the drum major(student leaders of marching bands) in my county together to do community service, have meetings to discuss leadership, conducting, etc., and help each of our bands together. This would all be done over the early part of the summer, beginning in about 2 weeks(finals then my family vacation). My band directors fell IN LOVE with the idea and said that's true leadership, and that Vandy would fall head over heels for me because of it(?)... I will be attending a week-long leadership and conducting camp for band this summer. As far as class rank goes, it has to be an estimate. My counselor says they only give seniors official ranks. Considering I got into NHS, I would assume I'm in the top decile(10%). At most, top 8%. There are roughly 300 students in my class. I will be pursuing a degree in finance and/or economics. Double major is preferable with those two. I want to go into investment banking. My grandfather is a VERY successful stock broker, and I've reached out to him to possibly do an internship or similar. As we speak, he is contacting other brokers he works with who could also help me and getting some economics books that he'd trust. I will be getting my series 7 license and a couple others within the next year hopefully. These tests will allow me to legally sell securities, insurance, etc... 

So?... I know my grades aren't exactly perfect, and I know I messed up last semester. But I am back on track now! Band really takes up 5-6 days of the week once June hits. We start practice before any sprots team and finish after them. It's about leadership, integrity, and to be frank, working your ass off the hardest. When I start something, I finish it. Not to be pretentious, but I believe I'm one of the hardest working people I know that are my age. I wish there was a way to tell Vandy's admissions that I PROMISE if I was accepted, that they wouldn't be disappointed. Thoughts?

P.s., I somehow am naturally good at writing essays. Like I walked into AP Lit with the SMART kids who beat me by a mile in math, and end up getting perfect scores on those 55 minute or whatever essays that are scored out of 9. Could this help me while writing my admissions essays? Do these essays have any effect on my chances?

Thank you."

Don't have an internship lined up so I have this project in mind for the summer. So for this project, I work at the school as an info desk worker. We clock-in and out using software called TimeClock. We get paid bi-weekly but to get paid, we have to enter in our hours manually through our schools directory. Now sometimes I forget to enter my hours and my pay for that time period would go in as backpay. I was wondering how would I go about making a program that enters in our hours automatically? Where would I start and what would I need to learn? I feel this is something good to put on my resume if I could actually get it to work.

TLDR; What do I need to learn to create software that enters in employees timesheets automatically?"

I worked on my resume last year and started sending them to companies this January (I sent them to big companies first, such as NASA and Oracle). As of today, I have sent my resume to over a dozen companies around my area, many of them being start-up companies (as big companies have strict deadlines and policies which I have failed to meet, and I am kind of pissed off at myself about that.) NO companies have responded thus far. 

The time is ticking, and the chances of a company hiring me to intern are very slim (if you're a company in the Bay Area looking for computer science interns, look no further, I gotchu covered, and I'll intern for free, better yet, I'll PAY you to let me intern for you), and many people here on reddit made me face reality and said that it's near impossible to get an internship as a high schooler.

What else can I do this summer to increase my knowledge on computer science that WILL both look GOOD and BENEFIT my college applications? My GPA isn't the best (yes, it's above a 3.0 and my weighted GPA should be above a 3.5, BUT I failed a class, just 1 mind you, but there's no way it can get out of my transcript) and I really want what I do this summer to help increase my chances of getting into a decent/good college for a computer science major. I'm most specifically interested in front-end, like web development and app development. I do know backend, such as Python and Scratch, and I'll learn Java in AP Computer Science A next year in school, but I hate backend programming with a passion and am only taking AP Comp Sci A so it looks good on my college apps and lets me hopefully waive out of backend programming courses in college.

Money is NOT an issue at all. I don't mind spending a reasonable amount to attend a camp or club, or group. I also want this to last the entire summer (mid-June to mid-August), because I don't want to spend half my time watching TV and eating chips. 

I am also very adaptable and am ready to work in any situation and with all sorts of people.

I do live in the Bay Area (don't want to go too specific on where I live), so if you know of anything in that area to meet my needs and to help increase my chances of getting into a decent/good college, PLEASE let me know. Even otherwise, let me know in general terms something good to do this summer. I don't want to waste these precious months mindlessly watching TV, and I WANT to get involved and learn more (and possibly make a change in the world). 

Also, I highly doubt there are any companies out there STILL looking for interns THIS summer, but if there are any, just PM me and I'll send over my resume and project samples straightaway (again, I am in the Bay Area, and not willing to work remotely unless it's my only option left)!

Here is a website I coded from scratch for a YouTuber if you're interested in seeing some of my work: jordanfisher2000.bitballoon.com
I also have a website with my resume and sample projects, but as it contains private information, I am only going to send it to those who PM me.

During previous summers, I completed Coursera courses and finished my community service hours. I want what I do this summer to be different; related to Computer Science, preferably front-end, but DIFFERENT. Something that stands out in my college apps. Something that makes ME unique when applying next fall.

Appreciate the help.
Thank you.

I am currently enrolled in a Computer Science undergraduate program at a moderately respectable university in the United States. My grades are not amazing, but I (from what I can tell) am an exceptional programmer when compared to others. I currently have a nearby internship lined up for the summer.

Thinking a bit to the future, I don't want to immediately jump into some white collar suburban life. I want to see parts of the world while I'm young; however, I truly love computer science and would hate to give it up.

What kinds of opportunities are there for computer science majors to work in various cities around the world? For example, work visas programs offering internships for about a year. I would hate to throw away the chance to see the world because of an obligation to an occupation.

Thanks."

I'm nervous. I haven't done any machine learning stuff, and I will admit, I am rustier than I thought on programming. I've been practicing, but I don't know what to focus on for RPA.

6bhyqv,0,2017-05-16,How important is a Bachelor's degree for becoming a sysadmin,kerOssin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6bhyqv/how_important_is_a_bachelors_degree_for_becoming/,"Currently I'm at the end of 2nd year of IT Bachelor's studies, I'd have another 2 years to go but I'm losing motivation for it. It's not completely useless but I just don't see much benefit from it. This semester we have a networking class and that'd make you think it would be really useful for someone wanting to be a sysadmin but there's not much focus on anything, there were some useful things but they were very basic and later it was just jumping from one thing to the next. One day you get to download a firewall program and configure a few basic rules, while the next day you get to show that you're not retarded and can use google cloud services like create events on calendar, create a gmail mailing group, upload a video on youtube and shit like that. There also classes like ""introduction to material science"" where you get to calculate the amount of atoms lol. Next year on paper has some good classes but some of them are also taught by the networking guy and most likely most of the courses gonna be shallow like it was before.

Great thing I got from these studies is that I got offered an internship for Windows server administration and after the that I started working at the same company in IT monitoring.

I guess the value of degree varies from region to region and from company to company but it kinda feels like a waste of time when I could devote more time to studying myself, experimenting setting up a home lab and passing some certifications. Also the guy who taught me during the internship is always happy to help and I could probably get some help from a ton of other admins that I get to talk to every day I work.

Some of the adverts for admin positions in the company I work in had a degree listed as a requirement but there's also some like ""unix/linux admin for critical infrastructure"" with a requirement: ""degree in IT or technical sciences/engineering OR certificates proving your competence"".

So is it worth it to spend time and go through all that crap to get a university diploma? Does it hold enough weight in this field that it'd really make a difference when applying for a job if you have relevant certification?


Edit: Thanks for all the advice, got some great points to consider. I'm not rushing anything yet, still have the whole summer to think about it."
6bibv7,3,2017-05-16,UCSD vs UW for CS/CogSci bs/ms,wwwee98,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6bibv7/ucsd_vs_uw_for_cscogsci_bsms/,"Hi, I just got off the waitlist at UCSD. I got into Cog Sci, which was my first choice. And I want to study Cog Sci! And I was comparing UW to UCSD. But, things are little complicated. Thank you all who read this article in advance :)

First off, I will start with my background. 

1. I started my career early. I'm a 3 years experienced backend programmer--I started programming since I was 10 and started my career when I was 15. But I don't think I am strong at CS fundamentals. I studied few basic algorithms, few design patterns, and few networking knowledges from books. And I'm a full stack developer, tho idk if it helps in college.
2. I want to complete bs/ms in 4 years--idk if it possible, but I got 30 credits from AP. I want to study Machine Learning and AI.
3. I want to start an education service startup or NGO which uses machine learning in the future. Making a better educational platform is my lifetime goal.
4. International student from Korea. So tuition is similar.

Therefore, UCSD Pros:

1. Great city. I don't like gloomy weather. I like to lie on the grass and code.
2. Cog Sci curriculum is good.
3. Maybe a better campus life.

UCSD Cons:

1. Cog Sci doesn't seems to offer 5 years bs/ms program so I have to move to CSE. And I've heard that it's near impossible. But think I can give it a try.
2. I've heard that entrepreneurship community is not solid.

UW Pros:

1. IT city. Better to start a startup and start internship.
2. I've heard that AI research is better at UW.
3. Solid entrepreneurship community and support.

UW Cons:

1. GLOOMY WEATHER :(
2. I got into Pre-Science so I have to apply for CSE.

---

So... I have few questions.

1. Is it THAT hard to move from cog sci to CSE? Even though I have CS basic knowledges?
2. Is UCSD entrepreneurship community bad?
3. Is there 5 y bs/ms plan for Cog Sci?
4. How is AI research in UCSD?
5. What would you choose?

Thank you :)"

I currently have a 3.87 GPA and hope to have a 3.92 by the end of the Fall semester. This may be long, so I'm sorry about that. If any one has school suggestions, see a school on my list that you think I should get rid of, or just transfer advice in general I would be very thankful.

List of schools *PS this list consist of a lot of reach schools at the moment

1.University of Virginia
2. Pomona College
3. Penn State (was previously accepted)
4. University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
5. Syracuse University
6. Vanderbilt
7. Tulane
8. University of Southern California
9. Pitzer College
10. Colgate University
11. Claremont McKenna College
12. George Washington
I'm also applying to 4 SUNYs but the only one I'm certain about is Binghampton

I don't want to apply to as many schools as I listed, the list used to be a lot longer. I took out a lot of schools that didn't offer a lot of financial aid. My EFC is 1320 but my mom can't actually contribute anything (she's in the process of paying me back money).

I've recently added UVA to my list because it has a lot of the things I want in a school. It's a big school with D1 sports, I think it has a good location, has generous financial aid, I looked into my major requirements and I liked the classes. I like the programs, the school has this good vibe about it if that makes sense. Honestly when I saw the website I just really like the school then when I looked at their academics I liked it a lot more.

Pomona has a ""Politics, Economics, Philosophy"" major that I like a lot. I'm currently a political science major but if I went to Pomona I would define lay try and change it to that. Pomona is a really good school for my major. It's in California which I love. I like that you can take classes at any one of the colleges on the Claremont campuses because I saw that some of he other schools had classes I liked. One of the drawbacks for me is how liberal the school is. When reading reviews about the school on Niche, which I do for every school I look at, the students said it was overwhelmingly liberal which is annoying to me. I also think they take the least amount of transfers of any school on my list.

Penn state was my dream school, I thought it was the best of both worlds academically and socially. I still think that but when I got accepted the first time I got about 25,000 in aid and this school cost over 50,000 for an out of state student so I don't think it would be financially doable honestly. When I visited I liked the people a lot more than I like the school. When I slept over at a dorm and ate in the cafe a lot of students sat with me and I thought that was really nice. This city girl also saw a cow for the first time which was cool. But when I got to the campus it was kind of a dud.I

I like UNC for a lot of the reasons I like UVA, big state school that still offers a good name and friendly people. A girl I watch on YouTube just graduated from UNC but I watch her vlogs and it seems like a great place. She shows the good and the bad, the activities, sororities, and sports etc and it seems like a place I could be happy.

Syracuse, I remember applying to Syracuse in highschool and then having the worse interview of my life so I pulled my application. Honestly right now I can't tell you what I like about Syracuse other than it's environment of students because I keep thinking about how mad that admissions officer made me. I know one negative about the school is the price tag.

Vanderbilt is really good for my major. I spoke to a representative at a college fair I went to this year and she told me I had a real shot of getting in. I like the program and internship opportunities I was told about. The main thing that concerns me is he schools location. I'm from NYC and I'm black. I've never directly faced racism so I honestly don't think about it that much so when I met with the Vanderbilt lady, I had never heard of the school before that, I thought this school is great I hope I get in. Then, as stupid as this sounds, I watched family guy last night where they drive through the south then got arrested and that freaked me out. Then I looked up most racist states and Tennessee was on the list. So that bothered me because I didn't know what to do with that information.

My hand is tired and for the rest of the schools it's mainly the same reasons as listed above. About the SUNYs btw the reason I'm not focused on them is because during my first application process my school pushed SUNYs onto us hard and I applied to four then like I am going to now. It was the most complicated process ever, they lost everything, I was supposed to be going to Buffalo and they changed the housing and over admitted people, the housing was so much money and the SUNYS I got into ended up costing more or around the same as most of the schools I got into. I am applying again but there aren't any that I love.

I want to go to a big school but I'm not against a small school. I want to go to a school where I can go to games I love hockey and baseball. No I wouldn't go to a school based on their sports but I am taking into account how much I will enjoy the school itself. I hated my highschool, I don't like my home life (it's one of my motivators in doing well, the thought of being able to leave), and I'm just not happy with my current situation so I want to be in a place where I will be happy. I plan on going to Law School, hopefully a tier one because I want to go into coorporate law. I want to have an internship while in school. I want to live somewhere really different from NYC because I've never loved any where else. I want to study abroad because I went on a highschool trip to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein and I loved it there. As I said before I'm not into an extremely liberal school like Reed. And if the school is liberal I just don't want it to always be the topic of conversation. I want to dorm so I can have that experience. I don't think I can afford a sorority but I've always liked the thought of them. I don't care if the school is predominantly white or what the demographics are as long as it's a good environment to be in. I'm fine with any size classes, all my classes now have about 25 people but I'm not a big talker so I wouldn't mind a bigger room.

6bjtda,1666,2017-05-16,TIFU by spoofing Pokemon Go,throwawaydafeels,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6bjtda/tifu_by_spoofing_pokemon_go/,"Throwaway because my siblings know who I am and idk this is something I don't want associated with my reddit account. Maybe because it's a personal story. Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago, but it's been on my mind for a while so I want to vent my fuck up.

Backstory: So my dad and I are not on very good terms, ever. There's a lot of fighting between us (and in the entire family) growing up like most typical Asian parents/families. That doesn't mean we hate each other; we love each other, but we struggle expressing it. It's hard for us to do anything together without it ending in screaming or yelling. We're just such different people, and we just lost all ways to connect to each other. It sucks, because I want to be a good son, but there's just no way for us to really relate to each other anymore. Me going away to college was kinda a good thing, it gave us less time to hate each other because we have less time to see each other.

Cue Pokemon Go, released last summer. When it came out, I got the app and so did the rest of my family. We actually played it together, which was interesting because that *never* happened before. Of course, my parents still had work, I was on summer break doing an internship, and my siblings were also working but still playing the game. We'd talk about it all the time, like ""omg look what I caught!"" and stuff like that. It was an exciting experience. Sometimes we'd go on family drives to the nearby pokestop/gym (living in the suburbs, there's only 2 nearby). It was definitely an interesting experience because it never ended in yelling.

When college resumed (entering my senior year), my dad helped me move in to my new apartment. The first thing we noticed was that there were 2 pokestops within reach of my bedroom. He joked about how unfair that was because we only had 2 pokestops in my town, and here back at college there are like a thousand pokestops and gyms nearby. Anyways, after moving in, he went on his way, and that ended the summer. Every time he came to visit me in college--whether it was to pick me up for something, drop off something, or whatever--he'd always go back on Pokemon Go and swipe for all the stops. Even when everyone stopped playing, my family would still play and talk about it well throughout the school year.

Then one day, in like February, my friend was showing me her collection of pokemon (AFAIK, me, her, and my dad are the only ones still playing PGO). She had 20 charizards, 20 gyarados, 5 dragonites and tyranitars and everything...and I was like ""Wait a minute. We used to only have like 3 strong pokemon each, wtf happened?!"" And she showed me that she started spoofing the game. She set it up on my phone in less than 20 seconds and suddenly I was in California, catching wild Charmanders. (Btw, in my 27 levels of legit gameplay, it took one quick spoof to catch my *second* charmander in my entire life. The first charmander was the free one they give you when you start the game.)

Instantly I was hooked to spoofing. I didn't use it to conquer gyms or catch OP strong pokemon; in fact, I still only have 3 strong pokemon, and they're currently occupying random gyms in idk-where Asia and they've been there for months (rip no more vaporeons). I used it to travel the world tbh, visiting places around the world (Me: ""Let's go to the Eiffel Tower, or the Berlin Wall, or the Great Wall of China, hell let's go to Australia!"") Eventually, I spoofed myself to boredom and quit the game. (Once you spoof, you'll never play aloof.) It just defeats all the purpose of the game, and it's no longer interesting to me anymore.

On the last day of college, when my dad came to help me pack up and leave, he started up the Pokemon Go app again. He said, ""Bet you're gonna miss these pokestops, huh?"" And I casually replied, ""Nah, nobody plays anymore. Everybody just hacks nowadays, the game is dead."" He responded, ""Oh..."" and that was that.

I'll never forget that look on his face. He looked sad, kinda like a defeated sad. As if this was his favorite game, and I just told him it sucks. Woops. I'm fucking crying right now while typing this. It feels like the last thing that kept us together was gone. And I feel like such a shitty son for what I did. I didn't even know how important this was to him until I just dropped the bomb like that. I killed the game for myself, and I kinda just killed the game for my dad too. It's so obvious he was only playing to keep in touch with his kids. This was the first effort he made to actually connect with us again in a long time, since we're all adults now. And I fucking slaughtered it. I'm such a shitty son. Even at graduation, which happened like a few days ago, *I still yelled at my parents.* I can't help it and I don't know how to fix it. I wish it was easier, but holy shit is this hard.

**TL;DR - Started spoofing Pokemon Go, which killed the game for me. Didn't realize Pokemon Go was the last sliver of connection between me and my dad.**"

I wan't to break into the IT field but I'm not entirely sure where to start considering where I'm at with my education. I started my college education with Computer Science but decided to switch to E-commerce because programming wasn't for me. I generally have a strong interest with computers. I built my own computer and gained a decent amount of knowledge over the past couple of years. I have a year left with this degree but considering that it isn't related to IT what is a good path to take now or after I finish this degree? I heard certifications are a good start but every job posting I search for ask for at least a years worth of experience. Are internships an option even though my degree isn't exactly considered in the tech field?

I'm a soon-to-be 4th year college student looking to get an entry level DevOps-related position when I graduate next year. I have this summer to study whatever I need to perform well in interviews and on the job. I've done a few SysAdmin internships and I'm starting to get familiar with DevOps tools like Docker, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc. On the programming side I know some python for scripting and automation tasks, but not any of the super CS-theory algorithms and data structures. My question is, what should I focus on studying / need to know? Should I pick up a book like Cracking the Coding Interview and learn some algorithms and data structures or should I just focus on learning ops tools and stuff? What about python scripting or other languages? Thanks!!!"
6bl9af,1,2017-05-16,One big accident,GentlyOnFire,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6bl9af/one_big_accident/,"I've been contemplating suicide for about 3-5 years now, currently 20 years old. Today was the tipping point that really pushed me over the edge. Long story short I had no idea about a confidentiality agreement regarding some information that I said to someone earlier and found out I may have just cost my father $3,000,000. I honestly 100% want to kill myself now, but I'm a coward and don't have any of the ""painless"" ways available to me immediately. Been sitting here with a knife in my hands for 2 hours, I just can't do it...

Here's what happened:
Yesterday I started my first internship, I found a connection through my dad and they hired me. Everything seems great the first and second day, until one of the chief officers asked how we all had heard about the company. I mentioned I heard about it through my dad who knew the CEO because they were working on a plan to sell the company in 2-3 years for about 6 figures of millions. I had no idea at the time that A: I was breaking a confidentiality agreement, and B: the chief officers besides the executive didn't know about this. 2 hours later I got a text from my dad, furious about how I can't ""EVER, EVER, EVER,"" talk about clients besides with him and how I had just broken the confidentiality agreement which, if taken to court, he would instantly lose and how if the deal falls through I just cost him $3,000,000. I... I had no idea. I just sat at my desk, speechless and stared forward. I felt terrible. The first thing that came to my mind was ""there's no way I can fix this or make it up to him."" What I had accidentally done was unforgivable, and there was only one way to truly show I was sorry.

Before that I'd been depressed for at least 5 years, at least I'm pretty sure. I can't express deep emotions to anyone. I just bottle it up and act okay, and because of that I've never reached out for help, I'd feel bad about it and wouldn't be able to explain it. My sadness to me is weakness, and to show it to anyone, even my parents, would be unthinkable. I just feel worthless and like I'll never amount to anything because of my social anxiety. Whenever I do find something to be happy about or feel like I've succeeded I always mess it up, like today. And it's always an accident, but it still happens and makes me feel terrible. I'm a successful student and pursuing a strong field with a good network, but I still feel like I'll inevitably fail or screw something up irreversibly like I did today. Better my family not have to invest anymore in my future or risk theirs on my behalf anymore. 

I have plenty of friends, but it doesn't matter. They'll be fine without me. My siblings and I aren't really that close, and I feel like I'm just a burden to my parents.

I can't pay back a possible $3,000,000 lost from 6 seconds of speech I didn't know I couldn't talk about. I can't fix the damage I just did. I can't fix the horrible person I see myself as. I just want it to be over but I'm a coward. I know we have guns here, and I think I know where but the noise would definitely attract the attention of the neighbors and I don't want them to be brought into this. "

6blccb,6,2017-05-16,"I don't want to, but I just can't do this anymore. I need help",facelessinternet,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6blccb/i_dont_want_to_but_i_just_cant_do_this_anymore_i/,"I don't know any of you, I don't think I need to for me to explain that I keep hurting myself and it's progressively becoming more terrifying for me. 

My 3.5 year relationship ended because of me, even if it was going to later on. It seems like it may have been on the down - at least to me because of my discontent which lead me to be insecure and make mistakes. I took responsibility and 6 months later I'm alone, fine. 

I don't want to attribute any of this to her, or our relationship, but since then I've been up and down every day. I've dated, work 2 new and exciting jobs, was promoted, I just don't see a point anymore. The therapist says anhedonia, and does CBT for my seemingly crippling OCD which lead me to confess this minor transgression that lead to a seemingly wonderful thing ending. I don't feel unworthy of love, or trust, or anything. I just see that I destroyed so much I worked for and it's literally 100% my fault.

I keep confessing everything to people. Things I did when I was 8, that I hit my dog once - the OCD is so bad I couldn't sleep until I donated to ASPCA. I wanted to, but I wanted my anxiety to go away. With every relationship, job, friendship, whatever I feel if they don't know everything I've ever done that I'm a liar and a terrible person and hiding things. I'm tired of crying myself under the fucking desk. I'm 21, I'm not stupid, I'm capable of doing things - I know that much, but since December 2016 I've just wanted it all to stop. I want my head to stop spinning. Medication doesn't do anything, therapy is a dead end, relationships end because the other person ""starts having feelings for me and doesn't want to"" (3 of those kinds - almost exact quotes.)

My GPA sucks at uni, I haven't had an internship since I was a senior in HS and I'm a senior in uni now. I'm just a disappointment and I try to mask it. I ruin a relationship that everyone and myself loved because I was too afraid to assert my needs; and I keep ruining my future because I don't see the point in anything. I've basically been abusing drugs from friends and my prescriptions for ADHD medications because I need to feel some kind of happiness. I stopped taking them for around 4 months and nothing changed, on or off it all sucks unless I'm over stimulated.

I just want it to stop, I don't want to have to abuse medication or steal medication, and I don't want to keep trying to kill myself. the past month I've was going to try twice and wussed out because I don't want to. Today, I finally built up the irrationality to try again and I don't want to talk to anyone because it sounds melodramatic and like a sob story of some hopeless romantic who's complaining about shit everyone goes through. I get it. It's dramatic, it's repetitive, all the more reason it's embarrassing because I haven't gotten through it and others have. Natural selection i guess. I just want to feel happy when I hug someone, or do a good job, or accomplish something; but I don't anymore.

I've lost and the only reason I didn't follow through today is because I cried myself onto the floor again and figured I'd seek someone else's experience and advice. I'm at my wits end and I need to talk to someone else about it besides my therapist. My former SO at least tried to listen to my OCD problems and craziness; like I did hers. Now everyone just thinks you're crazy or doesn't understand. I don't understand myself either. Why do I hate myself when I don't feel insecure or useless anymore? I can't tell anyone, I can't talk to my ex - she probably wouldn't respond and it's not fair to seek her comfort. My mother tells me to go to therapy, which doesn't help because I don't like that they make me sign forms and shit - like that does anything but make it feel like artificial care. My brother would tell me to chill and move on and get my act together. My dad, I don't know - I stay away from this stuff with him because I don't want to make him feel like I'm weak. I don't tell my friends except one who's not even that close with me, she's a kind soul. That still hasn't done me any justice because her advice isn't helpful - and that's not her fault - I burdened her with my feelings.

I don't want to die because of what it would do to my family, my friends, coworkers, but I know I need to change something or just end it. I don't want to so please help, or try to - anything to put my mind on continuing because I'm ata dead end."

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

While the build is going to function primarily as a gaming PC.  However I will be doing some school work and intern work as well (mostly processing power).  In regards to games I currently play HOTS, league, and player unknowns battlegrounds.  However I would like to be well suited for games that are more intensive should I choose to get into them in the future.  

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

1080p and 60+ fps on high settings is what I am looking for.  

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I want to stay under $1500 with a keyboard and monitor included; I already have mouse/mouse-pad.  As you can see from my current build I am over that budget so I need help reducing the price.  

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

US

I definitely wank to find work this summer, preferably internships/jobs related to my major. However, I also understand that it is quite late and that freshman do not often get internships in my major. 

In the case that I get no internships, my plan was to work local retail jobs at the mall, walmart, etc, which I am believe I would be able to at least get one opportunity if I start applying now.

The thing is, I wanted to apply to career/major related jobs first because that is what I would want over other jobs. However, if I wait too long on those jobs usually once high school finishes, all the students begin to take the local jobs at malls, walmart, retail, etc.

As a result, I decided to start applying for all jobs now, hopefully get something, and then continue looking for major/career related work knowing that I will at least have some type of work in the worst case scenario.

I have a couple questions about that.

1) Is this considered rude/unethical? For example, it might be possible that I accept a job as a bagger or cashier somewhere, and then if I continue applying and get a major-specific job like two weeks later, I would leave the bagger/cashier job.

2) How do y'all who've done this, deal with the job search process during your other work? For example, if I need to take time off my retail job to interview for a potential internship, do you just inform your current manager? Wouldn't they disapprove of that or maybe fire you? Is that just some risk you must accept?

6bmmuu,5,2017-05-17,Recent Grad not qualified for jobs. Looking for advice.,levrej,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6bmmuu/recent_grad_not_qualified_for_jobs_looking_for/,"I graduated in December with a BS in Computer Programming and a focus on web development. I decided to take a few months to myself to relax since I had no days off for a full year (school/internship/homework on weekdays, work 
full days on weekends).
After those few months of ""relaxing"" I started applying to jobs and got a good number interviews feeling super confident (3.45/4 GPA and pretty good interviewing skills), all of which I did not get the job because my programming and web development skills were very rusty (okay, really just kinda bad now to be honest), as I did not practice code for a very long time. My previous school experience with coding is pretty much forgotten, I didn't really work with various technologies that companies actually use, and I focused too much on technical support through work and my previous internship, which I realized I don't want to do. I'm lucky I have a good, steady job right now.

Now, I admit I became lazy after so much time being free, so I recently kicked my ass into work and took an unpaid internship with a pretty cool company doing web development as I continue to work on weekends. The first day was a little rough since I didn't really know what I was doing and I'm just super nervous about everything with the way things have been going. The extent of my knowledge goes only as far as beginner-level HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and XML. I don't really know much about using things like servers, wordpress, linux, domains/hosting sites, or C#/ASP NET/other languages that some jobs look for.
I feel as though I got too comfortable with my job that I did not focus enough on my future, and now working at a new place with a completely different environment feels weird to me. I'm starting to feel like a bit of a failure now, seeing my friends who graduated with me get jobs in their fields when I only just have this internship. It almost feels as though I shouldn't have graduated.

So I politely ask for advice, what can I do to really succeed in my internship? What can I do to improve my chances of getting a good job in the future? And how else can I improve my web development skills? (it feels a little difficult to practice coding now that I don't have assignments with a deadline, so I appreciate any and all resources I can use)?

What's the next best course of action?",emwhy11324,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6bmr6q/graduated_with_an_ee_degree_reluctantly_accepted/,"I graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. My cumulative GPA was a 2.4, I had one internship last summer, and no outstanding skills/credentials that every other applicant doesn't have as well. I do have three projects listed, but project experience is pretty ubiquitous. I didn't start my job search until a couple months after I graduated and I got my first offer as a staff engineer about a month and a half later. It's a small company near my hometown that deals with wastewater management and clean water distribution. Starting salary is 55k. I accepted because I'm aware that I am not that  competitive of a applicant, and it would probably take months and a lot of luck to land another offer.

For most of my time in college and for the few months post-graduation, I felt a total lack of ambition, I was really exhausted and depressed all the time, and in general just didn't give a shit about anything. I isolated myself while I was in school, so I don't really have a big network of alumni to reach out to. But now I'm feeling especially unhappy about my situation and I just want to break myself out of this slump. I know my situation could be worse but I keep thinking that if I had done some things differently while I was in school, then I could be working at a bigger company doing really cool shit, living in a more exciting city. A lot of my peers ended up at Boeing, Ford, Texas Instruments, Raytheon, Microsoft, etc. I just feel so lackluster in comparison. 

My job starts in June. In the meantime, I have been studying for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to obtain my EIT certification. I know the certification is not recognized among all industries, but I feel like taking the exam and passing would give me a boost of much-needed confidence. I have also been applying to other jobs. Not too aggressively, just a few applications a day. 

Is it pointless for me to continue my job search right now, considering my qualifications are not as impressive as other applicants'? Should I just stick to this job offer for a year or two and gain some skills, THEN look for another job? My parents have encouraged me to keep looking, and my dad said a lot of people at his company started work there for a few weeks or a few months, and left once they got a better offer. He said it's not that uncommon to continue seeking employment even after accepting an offer.

Also, what else can I do to make myself a more marketable applicant? Is it even relevant to do side projects (Raspberry Pi/Arduino) to put on my resume if I'm not in school anymore? "

This is what I'm passionate about and I'm really looking forward to it. To fill up the time between now and then, I'm trying to read a couple of good software design books. I don't want to read programming / DS&amp;A books per se, because I spent a ton of time doing interview prep and am quite comfortable with the CS fundamentals.

Here's a list of CS books that I think are worth reading- If anyone has read one or more of these books, can you rank them in their order of importance for a fresh graduate? 

1) The Pragmatic Programmer

2) Code Complete

3) Design Patterns: I tried reading this book last Summer during my internship, and honestly couldn't connect with it. Should I come back to it in a year?

4) Learn C the Hard Way: I always feel paranoid about my competence in C, even though this is what I interviewed / demonstrated my proficiency in.

5) Learn Python the Hard Way: Especially for the unit testing and the object-oriented / advanced concepts in Python.

Thanks for your feedback."

I am currently a 2nd year Probability and Statistics undergrad who is interested in the field of Data Analytics/ Data Science. I've taken some coding classes which have made me comfortable with Java and Python, but I feel very unprepared to start working towards getting internships. I have some knowledge with analytical packages for python (pandas, matplot.lib, numbpy), and I plan on spending this summer learning SQL online and making my own projects (i.e web scrapping and analyzing data, kaggle, etc). 


With regards to math, I've just finished taking my lower division classes, and so next year, I will be taking actual probability and statistics courses.

Despite all of this, I know for sure that I need to start learning things on my own because my university can only teach me so much. I want to make my toolkit as strong as possible, but I just feel like there is so much I need to learn. Where do I start? Do you guys have any strong resources I can use throughout the course of next year to expand my knowledge in this field?

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Penn State. My focuses and interests these past few years have been in the thermal sciences-- heat transfer, fluid mechanics, etc. I also have tailored these interests to aerospace. 

My question is do you think it is reasonable to believe I can get into a top 10 or top 15 (aerospace) engineering program? I'm talking about schools like Michigan, UT Austin, Washington, Purdue, etc. 

My GPA is mediocre-- 3.49/4.00. For classes that are important to my research interests (heat transfer, fluid mechanics, etc.) I have gotten As and Bs in. 

That said, I want to pursue research. I honestly don't like the idea of graduating with a B.S. and going to industry. A B.S. and the jobs it allows are nothing I thought engineering would be like. It's so watered down and I feel like I am a jack of all trades, master of none type thing. 

I do have one summer REU under my belt. I enjoyed that. I loved doing lab work and writing. In fact, I am a technical writing/speaking TA at my school. Additionally, I have served internships (dealing with the thermal sciences) at a major aerospace company and NASA. These experiences are why I think I have *some* chance of getting into a good program. Would you agree? 

I know I can get great recommendations from Penn State and my mentor at NASA. I also feel I can write a good statement. 


Yet, I don't have the grades. 

What do you think? Thank you so much. "

Due to my love for tech and since I didn't know what else to do, I started studying ""Economy Informatics"". There I kind of fell in love with Programming. We implemented a small Android App, a Webpage with Bootstrap and so on. 

I then went on to do an internship for a company, which used Hybris, Java EE and Spring, and so on.

Afterward I finished university and having been at this company for 5 months, I got a job as a Frontend Developer elsewhere.

So the last year I have been working on a legacy project, implemented with AngularJS 1, TypeScript, HTML, Bootstrap and so on.

My current standpoint is:

- I have only studied Economy Informatics, which normally is perfect for people, who want to do Consulting, SAP Programming, Business Intelligence and so on

- During my internship I wasn't able to learn much, I basically wrote a lot of Unit Tests and Refactoring. 

- I currently only do Frontend stuff, and there also basically changes to an existing system


So that's why I now want to get another job, because I want to learn. But the thing is, I fear everyone expects now so much of me. I have still basic problems with things like Maven, when I try to look into Backend things. I still have no real good portfolio, or work I can show off. I don't have much time due to my job and I mostly start some small Apps, but never finish them.

What career path would you guys think would be good? I hear that Backend usually gets paid more, but I lack more experience there. And Frontend I fear of also still lacking basic knowledge for already working one complete year.

I have not taken any web development classes since my university focuses on programming. I, therefore, am experienced with C/C++, Java, and Python. I also have some familiarity with scheme, Lisp, and Prolog. My only contact with web development is from when I had to do some data scraping with python and therefore had to acquire an understanding of the basic structure of HTML. My (employer?) knows that I have very little experience with web development so our agreement is that I will spend the first 20 days familiarizing myself with the technologies used by the company before I am assigned a project. I was sent a list of the technologies used and I have been having a hard time since I don't know how to approach the list and which elements to prioritize. I cannot ask around here as it seems I came at an especially busy time of year.

The list that I was sent is as follows:

Platform : Phonegap

Framework : Apache Cordova 

Framework JavaScript : AngularJS 1.x, jquery mobile

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) : Hibernate

Template : Responsive Design avec Bootstrap 3

Server side : PHP7

---------

Platform : J2EE 

JSP (JavaServer Pages) 

Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful Web services : marshalling data by JSON OR 

XML (consommation des api en restfull)

The Oracle Maven Repository: Search/Browse/Explore use for downloading libraries from Maven	

Template : Responsive Design with Bootstrap 3

Web mapping : Google map Api V3

Statistics : http://www.amcharts.com/javascript-charts/ (JSON DATA)

Moment.js (Full featured date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates)

This list is of all the technologies used by the company and I don't think that I am expected to know all of them, rather just to have a basic understanding and focus on few ones that I will work with (I get to decide) .

I should mention that I am likely to take on a back end programming project, so I don't necessarily need to be extremely familiar with the list (in case the elements are too advanced for the time that I have) but I have to understand it enough to be able to build programs that will be linked to it.

That is my situation and my problem is that, without basic knowledge in web dev, I do not know where to start, I try to find some tutorials (on Cordova for example) and I find that it requires some knowledge of xml or html, and so on. I am currently learning [some HTML](http://www.how-to-build-websites.com/), since it seems like a basic requirement for everything on the list but I don't know where to o from there. I would love to have a guideline of what I should learn first, and what should follow, or relevant sources for my situation. Any sort of help would be very much appreciated. 

TLDR : Computer science (Programming) student needs to learn specific web development tools, does not know where to start."

my plan for fall quarter would be ecs152, ecs122a, ecs171,easyGE,

is that an okay schedule? 152 is with Ghosal and 122 with Gysel, 171 with tagkopoulus. Will the workload be too heavy for fall? I will also probably have an internship. I'm not worried about the easyGE, since it might consume at most 2 hrs a week. 

Another plan would be to take 122a in winter and take 120 instead in fall. But this would mean I would have to take a different elective in winter. I was thinking of taking 170, Artificial Intelligence, can anyone who has taken that before give me some feedback/advice? 

Or, what is another easy Elective that I could stick in Winter quarter, given I take 120 in the fall and 122a in winter. I've already taken LIN177

I'm a 2nd year computer science student and all my colleagues on LinkedIn are starting their internships. 

When I look at their work history and experience, it's mostly they had one tutoring job for a CS class or had tech internships from high school. Then they have all these summer internships lined up. I have nothing lined for summer even after applying last fall. I had an offer fall through because the hiring manager stopped contacting me. It was suppose to start next week but I've been contacting their HR team, website, and even reaching out to him on LinkedIn. 

I don't think I'm better or the best developer and I think I have a lot to learn, but I know put more time than the the typical CS student who just goes to class. 

I've been reaching out to tech networks and events, and so far I've probably have at least one  personal contact with all the big tech companies. 

Whenever I ask them a recruiter in person if they have anything open for university students, they just tell me to go apply online. These are typically at professional events, and I'm usually the only college student at these events. I feel like that should say something about what I've done or accomplished when I'm usually only referred and invited because of my resume and credentials....I've had even software engineers review and check my resume and said it looked great with my experience (despite it being non-tech) and several projects. 

When they give me the ""just apply online"" line, I follow up with any contact info I can ask questions directly to. Then I ask if there any programs I can get involved with during the year. This always get me some kind of answer and they invited me to their offices or ask if I want to volunteer or mentor an education programs they have. I've been taking all these opportunities but it's not helping at all with getting referral to a recruiter or hiring manager. 

One that's annoyed the most when I've been to their 2 of their HQ's 5 times to help and 2 tech referral only events and no matter how much I put myself out there, they're so vague. 

This is also costs time and money. When I'm volunteering or mentorring or invited to events for their programs, that's time that I could be working and paying off bills. I'm in $1000 in credit debt for the last 9 months as I've been progressively working less hours. I come from a low income family so I have no support in transportation costs but my family proud of me because I'm working with all these companies.

If anyone wants to look at my resume, please feel free to PM me. I'm so tired and I honestly want to give up. I've been a free hand for all these top companies and they're not helping me with anything.

6brx8j,9,2017-05-17,Pretty much lost with life,bragasaurusrex,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6brx8j/pretty_much_lost_with_life/,"So I'll break the main points down and put a TL;DR at the end. 

I graduated high school in 2003 and since then, things just seem to be getting worse.  School was always a breeze for me, as well as sports and social interaction.  I was always very liked, respectful, and just overall successful at anything I attempted. I got a full ride scholarship to play football at a D1 school, subsequently getting six concussions in two years and was told I medically could not play anymore.  

I made the tough decision to come home to finish school and had a very difficult time for awhile.  Looking back, I can honestly say this was all a result of the head injuries, my brain was pretty much mush for quite some time. I saw a psychiatrist due to my mother begging me as I was not myself and had difficulty concentrating and was diagnosed ADHD.  That seemed to help and I seemed to find my way  despite just being unhappy with life, but kept the end goal in site of getting a good job and starting fresh from there.  I had basically written off any type of ""college experience.""  I graduated from a good business school with a degree in finance in 2009 which unfortunately was the peak of the financial recession and could not find a job anywhere, or even an unpaid internship despite a 3.85 GPA.  Took the advice of my dad and just started applying anywhere to start building a network and eventually got a job at a law firm to pay the bills.  my interest really grew in that so I studied hard for the LSAT, took that and was admitted to law school in the area that allowed me to keep my job and gain experience as I was in school.  Things seemed to be looking positive for the moment. 

I graduated in May 2014, or so I thought, and was studying for the bar exam when I got an email from the dean of my school and was told that somehow an error was made in my graduation audit that previous winter and subsequent final semester scheduling and instead of taking 12 credits, I somehow only was slotted for 11.  This had far reaching implications from me not actually graduating and being able to take the bar exam I had been studying for for months, to my student loan deferment for not being full time, being dated back 6 months from December, and not May, so I owed 28xx for July and August, couldn't take the bar exam and had to take another class during the fall semester just to graduate.  This really had a huge negative impact on my mindset and I went into a pretty deep depression, withdrawing from anything social, and having no desire to do anything physical, which was usually my stress outlet (I really enjoy lifting weights).  

I had no money and really no options.  I couldn't get financial aid to take the class I had to take to ""graduate"" and lost around 3500 to 4000 in fees for the bar exam I couldn't take.  So again I started searching for a job and was hired by a mortgage lending company to originate residential mortgages.  Breezed through all the testing and training that was required and in the mean time, took the class required for graduating and was able to start ""banking"" right around the time I would have been able to finally take the bar exam.  I decided against it as I hadn't been studying due to the demands of the job, and wanted to give this a shot as it seemed like something I'd be very good at.  

I was very good at it, but increasingly realized that this is an industry where you truly have no life and the demands the company places on its employees borders on insane.  Approaching two years on the job I had ignored many small health issues due to simply just being too busy and the demands to perform in a sales environment too intense.  I averaged 4 to 5 hours of sleep per night, worked 13 to 14 hours a day, didn't take a day off for over a year and frequently would just work all week on little to no sleep, then crash and sleep the entire weekend from friday night around 10 or 11 (when I got off work) until Monday morning at 5:30 when I had to get up to start the week again. I finally woke up one day with chest pains so intense I drove myself to the hospital and explained this to the doctor, who had a heart to heart conversation with me that I seemed to be fine for the moment, but was on my way to a heart attack or who knows what.  

I took a medical leave from my job that was unpaid, saw some doctors to get my health in order.  I had a slew of physical issues I had to address (high blood pressure, low testosterone, blood in stools, hypothroid) but after seeing a psychiatrist again, now had to deal with apparently having developed (or always had since my concussions) bipolarism.  Started medication and after attempts with several, finally found one that really works and keeps me even, really a world of difference.  

I've been out of work for around 11 months, no pay, and was allowed to resign from my position after 9 months on medical leave rather than get fired.  I attempted to transfer to a different position in the company but was told due to the high turnover rate of bankers, this is not something that is given any consideration as then everyone would want to do it.  

I have been applying to jobs across the spectrum for around 3 months now, having had one interview that I thought went very well but they were looking for someone with an engineering background.  It would take probably 9 to 10 months to prep for another bar exam and sit for it, and I don't have the resources at this time to make that a viable option.  Aside from just applying for as many job as possible, I don't really have any other strategy even though it definitely doesn't seem to be working.  It seems everyone is looking for a specific type of experience that I don't have, or jobs that would allow me to get experience, think I'm just going to leave asap and they don't want to waste their time.  

This is wearing on me mentally a great deal, as I've always done extremely well wherever I have been, whether it is school or a job but just don't seem to be able to get a chance I need to succeed that is healthy for me given my need to not have a job that dominates my entire life.  I know I can't go back into the mortgage banking job in a sales role because the nature of that job is always being available for clients, and if you aren't you lose the business to someone who is.  I'm running out of money fast, and I try to stay as positive as can be, but it's just something that no matter what, not having success even finding a job despite being very qualified and willing to work for much less than I made before, is just eating me from the inside out.  

I find myself almost bracing for things to get worse, as that's just the way it has seemed to go for the last 10 years or so.  I don't want it to be that way nor think that's a healthy mindset, but it's just hard to not try to prepare for worse when that's been the common theme for quite some time now.  I realize that life could be much worse and I try to keep that in mind, but that's not helping me get a job or pay the bills, or feel good about myself.  I feel like a fucking loser, even though if you knew me you'd be surprised at that revelation.  

I hope all that was clear, willing to clarify anything or answer questions.  Appreciate any advice, feedback, tough love or whatever you have to offer. 


TL;DR: I'm 32, finance degree, law degree, quit unhealthy sales job after 2 years due to health issues and now cannot get a job anywhere.  Have student loans over 100k, and no matter what I do things just seem to get worse.  Any advice is appreciated.  "

Throughout college I was using C/C++ since it was the primary language being taught at my school, so I'd say I'm most proficient with it. I taught myself some Python and JavaScript, but I would not be comfortable doing a whiteboard interview with those two languages.

I don't have any relevant work experience to put on my resume, and I haven't done any internships either. 

I have 5 projects detailed on my resume, which were mostly projects I completed in school. The most impressive being a deployed Web Application made with a small group of people using Python, Django Framework, Amazon Web Services, Bootstrap, and PostgresSQL. The other projects were done in C/C++ (Compiler, Games Manager, and a Pen Testing Toolkit) and an FTP Server &amp; Client done in Python.

I've been working through Free Code Camp learning JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but I feel like this isn't the most productive use of my time considering it's not producing a presentable project.

From what I hear, my area (Orange County) has a ton of software jobs available, but I've had no luck. When applying to jobs, I've been mostly using Indeed, which got me a few phone interviews and maybe 2 on-site interviews. A recruiter got me 3 phone interviews and 1 on-site interview as well. I was not a good fit for any of those companies, obviously. I've been applying to listing within a 50 mile radius from me, and even some in Silicon Valley. I just don't think any company would want to relocate an entry level applicant.

At this point I'm not sure what I should be focusing on most. Should I be working on a bigger personal project to put onto my resume? If so, should I try learning a new language/framework? Should I just keep sending out resumes constantly, even to places asking for 3+ years experience?

But here goes.

A bit of background: I started using disordered behaviors my junior year in high school. Officially diagnosed with anorexia/orthorexia and GAD when I was 17. Went away to college, my parents threatened me that I needed to gain weight, and it turned into cycles of binging and restricting. It was shitty, but it got me to a point of weight restoration and everyone around me thought I was fine.

I kept this facade up, graduated, did an internship, and moved across the country for a job and the change of scenery helped push me into a healthier relationship with food. Finding the satisfaction in work, friends, and my relationship at the time helped me stop retreating away from social and work events and I finally had a bit of peace. 

I got on an antidepressant about a year into the job, and it seemed like the final piece of the puzzle. For the first time in years, my binging was manageable. It still happened, but less, and with less severity. I could wake up the next morning and stop the cycle of punishing myself for it and prolonging things. I learned my triggers and did my best to avoid them and I thought this was what recovery would look like for me. 

Then, I got pregnant. I was sure I would balloon up, I would be disgusting, I would never feel comfortable in my own skin again. But that wasn’t the case. For the entire pregnancy I was actually really stable. I gained a healthy amount of weight, but I felt beautiful and I had a pretty good balance of healthy foods. For the first time in my adult life I was able to accept and give into cravings without feeling guilty. My son was born, and I half expected to go back to behaviors but again, not the case. 

A few months postpartum I even “dieted” (I use the term loosely, because I really just paid a little bit more attention to food choices and put more effort into working out) in an effort to lose the last bit of pregnancy weight. I felt great! I was back in the body I had come to know, I was choosing generally healthy foods but eating enough and often throughout the day. It was amazing.

Fast forward to now: My little guy is 14 months, and I’m still breastfeeding. I adore the nursing relationship, and have no desire to let it go. That said, I’ve continued to steadily lose weight since last summer. Not to an alarming rate, about 20 pounds altogether, but enough that I’m starting to waiver along the line of healthy-underweight. I feel like I can’t eat any more in a day. I’m compensating for the calories that he gets from me, but apparently not enough to make up for being tall, in my 20s, and having a generally high metabolism. 

I’m at a loss. I know that I should probably be trying to gain a little weight at this point. My partner has commented, my parents have commented, my friends that know about my history have commented. And yet, it’s still so challenging for me to actually push myself to take in even more food. I’m not at the point where I’m even hungry at the end of the day, and I still find it almost heartbreaking to watch the numbers on the scale go up. It’s a weird feeling. 

I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of writing this. Solidarity, maybe? Advice, if anyone has been in this odd intersectional place. I don’t want to go back down the road of restriction, but I also don’t really feel like I’m restricting right now? I don’t want to wean my son yet, I know he’s not ready, and I also know that weaning and the hormones and anxiety that can be associated with it would be too much for me right now.

On top of that, I’m a graduate student, working on my thesis, teaching for the university, doing freelance work, and in couples counseling trying to work with my partner through his own issues. I just need a hug =/

TL;DR In recovery from multiple ED’s, thought I had a handle, losing weight again and questioning if it’s disordered behavior or just a side effect of all the stress and should keep doing what I’m doing"

Will starting in the spring have a harmful impact on my opportunities for finding internships, especially after my freshman year? Should I start applying for internships this fall before I even start attending college? How should I indicate on my resume that I haven't started college yet?

The adviser also said the name of the community college that I transfer credits from may appear on my transcript. If my transcript says that I transferred credit from a community college, do you think that will be an issue to employers? I'm afraid they might not like that I won't have all my credit from Cornell.

Besides community college, what other options should I consider for things to do this fall? I don't think I'll be able to find an internship because my computer science resume is mostly empty at this point since I just became interested in the field, but I plan to work on some projects this summer.

- Unemploy for 8 months, included during 3 months of internship after graduation.

- During the interview day, I have to wait another 3 hours before the interview start. Apparently they are very busy.

After I got the job:
- The 1st few days of doing overtime, I felt like I contribute something to the company. And it felt great. 
- The section that I handle has so much stuff going on that I can learn a great deal from it.
- Then, I come to know that I am expected to spend 60-70 hours per week at work.
- With so much stuff that I have to handle, I thought that the expected working hour can help me to sort all of those works.
- Now, I am half-believe that I have to literally live in the company to get all the job done.
- I might have an attitude problem as my boss pointed out, but to work 12 hours per day doesn't help me.
- Right now, as I'm writing this, I spend 3 hours at work, from 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm, way pass overtime limit, googling about 'should i quit my job.'

She offered me a program for minorities where theirs a lot of scholarships, internships and she told me a lot of her graduates are highly sought after for computer engineering and they start off at around 80k. So I was just looking at the pros and cons.

Chemical Engineering @ UT or Texas A&amp;M
   
     Pros- seems more interesting, more hands on and moving around, high salaries in 
     Texas, I like chemistry a lot (I know CE is different from chemistry) but got an A in gen   Chem 1 &amp; 2 when the class average was a D which motivated me, and a degree from           
     UT or A&amp; M would have a lot of good weight.

     Cons- would be a hassle to transfer, would be really behind if I transferred, wouldn't 
      Know anybody. Always a chance I don't get accepted (currently have a 3.88 GPA but            
      heard it's hard to get in to), probably harder course work since it's a more prestigious  
       school with more focused students (probably wrong on this)

Electrical/Computer Engineering @ Texas State

     Pros- I can stay at my small liberal arts/party school and excel, more broad 
     field, easier to network since I'm at original university, could possibly love coding, more 
     stable career then a Chem e (correct me if I'm wrong), still going to be behind but not
     as much if I transferred, and program advisor offered me 
 
     Cons- never coded in my life so don't know if I'm interested in it, don't know if I want to     
     work on computer the rest of my life

***Pros of taking DS at my current school (summer: theory of computation, fall: DS)***


-it is in java (which I am more comfortable with), may get a better grade because the teachers here are leinent, I will be able to lighten my load once I transfer


Cons:


-I will have to take the prereq over the summer, the professor for DS is the only  one and he is infamous for being absolutely horrible, will not learn as well, tution scholarship wont cover the summer semester, I wanted to use the summer to solidify programming concepts, learn DS/discrete math and make side projects

I'll be finished with my associate's degree in software development this summer. For reference, the classes I've taken include: C++, 2 semesters of Java, a semester of HTML/CSS, and I'm taking a class now on ASP.NET with some C#. I'm 21 years old and I currently have a software support job making a little over 40k/year. I'm finding it hard to find a job with only an associate's degree and I'm not sure where to go next. I don't want to continue on to my bachelor's until I can pay for it outright because I'm completely against debt. I also can't take an internship anywhere because I need a full-time job to support myself. I'm assuming I'll either need to keep trying to find a job and get myself some more self-taught experience. I feel most strongly about Java, but I don't know how to get more experience after school and I'm not sure how to develop a project on my own because I don't feel creative enough to come up with an idea that hasn't already been done well. Any thought and suggestions are welcome and criticism is fine as I need to get somewhere.

Thanks all,

I graduate in the spring of 2018 and plan on applying to jobs soon. Does anyone have any experience applying to the network specific jobs at Google/Facebook for example?

6c14j9,3,2017-05-18,Do I even stand a chance?,theBCexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6c14j9/do_i_even_stand_a_chance/,"So I just graduated with my bachelor's in CS about a week ago. I started applying for jobs a year before graduation. Between then and now, I've applied to 100+ jobs. I know in such a long time span that's not a lot. I would like to have applied for more, but there were long patches where life got busy and I just didn't have the time to apply as much as I would have liked. However, I did start applying more and more the closer I got to the end.

While I was in school, I also took the opportunity to network. I went to some career fairs, conference, asked professors, people who work in IT at my retail job, friends, etc. I was looking for small opportunities here and there to have *some* experience before I graduated. I came close a few times, but they all ultimately fell through. So, here we are now. I have no real experience, a meager set of projects I can use as a portfolio, and a bachelor's degree with a good GPA. 

I actually ended up in a Skype interview this morning, mostly because I reached out to the recruiter directly through his email. It turns out I misread the job description and I was under-qualified, but he decided to interview me anyway. He asked me what my salary expectations were. I knew some friends (granted, with internship experience) who had gotten jobs already making close to $60k out the gate. So, I told him $50k sounded reasonable. According to Google, the Houston area (where I am) has an average entry level software engineering salary of above $60k, so I thought maybe this was reasonable. He told me not only should I expect to get a crappy first job, but I should probably aim as low as $40k. Certainly disheartening to hear, but I get that I'm competing with a lot of people with some experience, so I figure he might be right. I told him I hoped to get a job where I wasn't forced to work 70+ hours every week; he also told me for someone in my position, that was also a pipe dream.

So, at this point, I can accept that I will make about $20k less than average. I can even accept that I will basically be miserable working long hours at a crappy job. I just want to know, and give it to me straight: do I stand a chance at even getting that much? Like even if I apply like crazy and assemble my meager portfolio, should I even try? Should I just accept that all those years at college was a waste and accept my poverty, or is there at least a decent chance? 

**EDIT:** I should mention that if it turns out I'm not completely hopeless, there were a couple of things I was planning to do to expand my portfolio. Last year, I started an Android application. I actually made some progress, but as I said, life got busy and didn't get the chance until now. I was considering finishing that, or I was thinking about making a personal website from scratch so that itself could be something to showcase. If you think I still have a chance, which would you recommend I start? "

6c255w,1,2017-05-19,Intern expectations,csinternnn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6c255w/intern_expectations/,"Hi guys,

I am only a sophomore, and I'm lucky enough to have received an internship from a small yet reputable fintech company. Including housing, my compensation totals out to be over 11k/month - it's absolutely insane and I was not expecting this at all. I feel like this intern market is kind of broken with these salaries, and I worry about finding an equal or better offer elsewhere when I graduate, as it's kind of weird for an internship to pay more than a FT offer. 

However, that's not my main worry. My internship starts in a couple weeks and tbh I'm scared shitless for what they expect of me, as the people there are all super high caliber from top schools, including my interviewer who turned down an offer from Google to work there. The interns are all juniors, mostly from top schools, except for me.

In getting this offer, I feel like I totally fudged my project descriptions to make them sound better/cooler/more complicated than they really are.

For example, I built a winning project for a hackathon using machine learning, computer vision, and web automation. My interviewer seemed to be impressed with this, but really it was just gluing together APIs and making things look pretty. My code was a mess, everything was jerry rigged.

I'm doing a project for the government (think NASA ish) outside of school, but I kind of buffed my contributions with interesting words. Really, I just created a multithreaded script that runs simple commands by calling an existing program, and fellow mech engineering classmates built a physical ""thing"".

I created a finance project with 5 people and I described my project as a whole instead of my contributions, which were mainly gathering and parsing data, and made it sound like I did much more than what I actually did. Of course, I did help out with the whole thing, but I did not actually code parts of everything.

During the coding interview, I struggled with part 2 of a simple problem, and the interviewer had to help me out. I thought I bombed it, as this was a leetcode easy.

During the system design interview, I had a weird advantage where I had already done something I'd say 50% similar, but decided not to mention that for some reason. I had a good head start due to familiarity, but struggled through it, and although I finished, my interview concluded 25 minutes late due to my slowness.

_______________________
The point of all this is that I feel like a phony. I don't mean to lie about my contributions, and I really want to learn and succeed. However, I know that there are much more qualified people in my class who are struggling to find something, and I just got lucky. I feel like I don't deserve this at all, and I am afraid that I won't be able to compete on the same level as the other interns and am worried that I won't perform up to par. Has anyone else found themselves in this position? How did you handle it?"
6c2ksx,39,2017-05-19,Chinese Parents won't let me date Indian boyfriend,kawaiife,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6c2ksx/chinese_parents_wont_let_me_date_indian_boyfriend/,"An Introduction: I'm 21, finishing my second last semester in university, and I am Malaysian-Chinese. I'm dating my boyfriend of three years who is Indian, and 33 years old. I don't mind his age, he is mature and has never been creepy. We are quite perfect together, only fought once, and plan to get married as soon... the only obstacle is my ultra-crazy Chinese parents. I'm not exaggerating. 

They caught me with him a third time now because they had my bank statements printed without my knowledge and found my boyfriend's address as one of the mailing addresses for my online shopping. My parents constantly tell me not to buy things despite me having a part time job, and I've tried to kick the habit recently, and then this happened.

They drove to his house and faked-nice talked to his parents, who happened to be there. I said fake-nice because when my parents returned home, they beat me, scolded me, all whilst telling me how disappointed they were, and hurt, and where did they go wrong, and why didn't I just tell them the truth (that yes, I'm dating him)... 

This has happened twice before with similar results. I've told the truth before, which earned me several punches and kicks from my parents. I can't fight back because they'd only beat me more. So now, if they ask me anything, I clam up, keep quiet, and hope they just beat me and leave me alone after that.

They called my university to check my schedule, and called my part-time job employer to terminate me, and (which made me angry) they are forcing me to refuse a journalism internship with one of the country's leading publications. They ask if ""this guy"" (my boyfriend) forced me to do this internship (he didn't... I really wanted it, I emailed the editor and begged for it, even). Now I have to say no to it, when I've just got the job. I am quite devastated, understandably.

I'm not allowed to go out at night or during weekends, and I have never done so. I don't smoke, drink, or gamble. I am polite, I don't argue with my parents, unlike lots of other kids. I do most of the housework. I guess the only catch is that I'm not very smart- didn't go to law or accounting school, or have stellar exam results (like, they're OK, but not boastworthy). I only see my boyfriend on weekdays, when I don't have classes in university. My parents may label my boyfriend under the negative ""Indian"" stereotype- always drunk, beats his wife, poor. But my boyfriend loves me, and he is financially stable- no debts, no loans, no insecurities. He is just Indian and older. I have never told them we were dating... they found out the hard way. I only told them once, with dire consequences. Like normal people, I know that honesty is important; I would have been honest if it wasn't such a difficult choice.

We tried to reason with my parents before. It didn't work. They just beat me up later. I wish they would just listen to me. I understand that every parent wants the best for their kids, but they have their own version of the best.

I want to move out and move in with my boyfriend, is it a wrong thing to do? I feel like I a bad daughter. My parents say I am stupid, they are ashamed of me, and I make them look like fools and give them problems. They constantly guilt-trip me because they have made so many sacrifices over the years like pay for my education (I'm on a scholarship, and I took a government loan...), feed me, clothe me, give me an allowance for transportation... Anyway... thanks for hearing me out. Any advice? If I move in with my boyfriend, I'm 21, can my parents get him arrested for kidnapping?

For context: my boyfriend's parents adore me. My boyfriend is an understanding person, and always stands up for me, even when he met my parents, but I have told him not to, because they only beat me and yelled some more after that. "

Company 1) Small company up to 10 employees, distance is five minutes, 2 months service desk and later on I will be doing projects with the IT-team. A small chance for career opportunities. The staff seem nice, a little bit disorganized (which I hate). (Compensation Unkown)

Company 2) Huge world wide IT/STREAMING company, distance is 1,5 hour with the train, will be sleeping at familymembers house or rent an room/appartment with a classmate of mine. 

There are two departments which are interested in me, one of them is Service Operation Center where I need to have great problem solving ability and mainly focussing on assisting other departments or customers. The problem on this one is I haven't done much with streaming and it will be a difficult task solving problems related to streaming.

The other one is the Network Operation Center where I'll be configuring switches mostly, I have configured switches before such as the Foundry FastIron and the Juniper switch but it was a bit difficult for me but still kind of fun when it worked. (Compensation Unknown, will be asking kindly and not money hungry since I really need the financial support to being able to work there) (lets say I choose NOC, how important and needed is someone who is specialised in configuring switches?)

Should I sign the contract or wait for the other 2/3 companies, the others are small and one is a IT department of a highschool with a lot of different locations."

Initially, I understood what this internship contains and I know that I would have the opportunity to learn a lot and potentially have a lot of growth there.

Personally myself, I am not extremely experienced in the field of AI but I would say I am experienced in software development in general. 

However, after yesterday having a 1 on 1 with my manager did I really understand the exact scale of it all. Basically, I am starstruck by the people I am working with and the person I am working for.

* My manager is a VP at the company over looking AI projects
* He was also one of the original creator of Torch (the DL framework)
* My mentors and other co-workers are all Ph.Ds specializing in machine learning and AI, they also have given talks on these subjects
* My tasks for this term would include working with some of the more exciting and recent DNN (like GANs)

I know this sounds like bragging in a way but to me, I have no clue how to exactly go through this internship because it feels just so overwhelming amazing with the potential I am seeing here. I feel like this would be a pivot point in my career even and can greatly define the path I will go down in the future. It definitely feels like I am looking up at giants of the industry. 

These are the question that I have

* How should I interact with my manager, should it be different because he is an VP?
* How do I not be overbearing with my co-workers and my mentor?
* What acts of initiative should I take to help me maximize it all

6c42xr,4,2017-05-19,I want to enroll in a coding bootcamp but I'm scared,throwaway12321asda2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/6c42xr/i_want_to_enroll_in_a_coding_bootcamp_but_im/,"Hi, so I'm M/22 and I've been learning programming by myself for a year, but I don't think I'm ready at all to find a junior position (especially because I have no CS degree nor work experience). That's why I recently searched for coding bootcamps and found a web dev one that I'm interested in. I still need to pass a technical interview. Now the problem isn't really the technical aspect itself because I can easily do basic programming already. The problem is myself.


I have a young appearance (I look 16-17 at most, and sometimes people literally don't believe my actual age). I dress young, am short and have longish hair. I also realize I'm not very ""adult-like""; I am ignorant in many real life subjects. I don't watch the news. I have kid friends. I am upset when bad things happen. I am financially and emotionally dependent on my parents. I've never lived on my own and I have no work experience whatsoever other than 2 short internships (I got fired in the first one but in the second one I think I did well). I've never had a relationship nor am I interested in ever having one. I've been told I'm naive and ""sheltered"" and when I was 18 I was told by a psychologist that I ""hadn't emotionally transitioned to an adult"" (I only had 2 visits with her so she could easily have been wrong).


Now, the bootcamp people have told me that they expect their accepted students to be committed, motivated, hard-working, professional and to have the capacity to learn, since this program is meant to get you hired as soon as you finish it so they're gonna be two extremely intense months, so they want to make sure that all students that get into the program will be ready for a job afterwards. I have tried to appear ""strong"" in front of them but I am worried that the way I talk or the things I say give me away somehow, as I can see that they have their doubts even if only due to my looking 16.


The thing is, I am motivated, I like programming and want to get a job ASAP, but I don't know if I'll be able to follow it through, not because of lack of motivation, but because I don't know if I'll be able to handle it emotionally and intellectually. I am also not very intelligent and I suck at math.


Another thing is, even if I manage to keep up, I'm scared that I won't get a job because the potential employers will interview me or even just take a glance at me and think ""no way"". Because why would anyone hire me anyway when the others will surely look and act like professional, reliable and smart grown men? And I'm afraid that my parents are going to pay all this money for nothing and that I'll let them down, that I'll let the professors down too, and will contribute negatively on their numbers (since they want 100% of their students to get a job in programming after the camp, currently at 95%).


On the other hand, I feel like this is a big, unique opportunity for me and I don't want to miss out on it just because I'm afraid of failure, afraid to let people down, afraid to not be able to get through the first week and accept that I'm too intellectually dumb for a programming career (or any career really).


TLDR: I can get into a bootcamp program that could easily get me a job afterwards but I'm scared to fuck things up because I look like a kid and I may be emotionally one so I don't know if I could handle the bootcamp or a job. My parents are willing to pay for it but they don't know about my doubts/fears. I have to make a decision ASAP. What should I do? I really need help, advice, suggestions, input of any kind. I can't talk about this with my young friends, and the adults work in non-technical fields. Thanks in advance. Posted on careeradvice too (I don't really know where my post fits...). "

I've been trying to make this decision for weeks, and I'm down to the point of asking redditors for help.  
  
I am going into my senior year of being a software engineering major in my hometown/state, but this summer, I have the option of taking summer classes and only taking 15 hours each semester I have left, or completing my internship with a pretty large company. I interned with them last summer and got a return offer. The best thing I've done is written a pro/con sheet, among talking to my family and friends.  
  
**Choosing the internship:**  
**Pros:**  
- I get to keep the relationship with the company.  
- I will more than likely receive a full-time offer for when I graduate.  
- I make more money than I would working in my hometown this summer.  
- Career advancement, guidance, etc.  
- Family is happy.  
- I can pay off some bills (rent left in college town, car repairs, etc)., that my family cannot afford.  
**Cons:**  
- I lose my relationship. Even though it's two months, my bf isn't interested in long distance and I understand that.  
- I cannot take summer classes. Cal 3 and Physics 2 are not offered online; meaning, I am looking at both an 18 and a 19 hour challenging semester right before I graduate.  
- I might not pursue this company after I graduate, making the internship itself a waste of time?  
- My car may not make it, meaning I will be in the suburbs (no transit this far out), without any transportation of my own. 
- For the first couple of weeks, I will be on someone's couch until I can move into a subleased apartment, meaning no privacy/comfort while I first get adjusted. 
  
I have talked to my family, who mostly want me to go to Charlotte and feel that I have spending problems and that I need more money to pay back what I've spent than what I would make here. They also feel that my relationship is toxic and to lose it wouldn't be bad (I can understand this), and that I spend a lot of money going out with my friends, which would be hard to do without friends.  
  
My friends and boyfriend believe that I would be much happier at home. This is true; I absolutely hate being alone and did not make more than one friend last summer and also wouldn't have transportation to go out and make new friends. They also pointed out that if I wasn't sure I wanted to go after graduating, that it would be a waste of time. I'm sure my friends will still talk to me while I am away, but the losing the boyfriend thing sucks still.  
  
My two college/professional advisers actually were pretty pissed when I told them I was considering not going to the internship. By pissed, I mean it seemed like they wouldn't even be interested in working with me anymore if I didn't go. They both made comments saying that my future is important, and even should I not go with this company after graduation, that keeping a good relationship with them is still important, among more comments of how I have come so far and to not complete this internship to stay home and work and take classes would be a setback, etc.  
  
Overall, the entire situation has stressed me out and I've been doing the most not to think about it, but I don't have much time remaining.

A little bit of background on me first, been at university for 2 years in the UK and starting a year internship in another city. So far I've come to university and stayed close to school friends that joined with me. Branching and finding new people has been difficult. 
I've had 2 part time jobs in this time and I've felt like I've never really connected with anyone and feel like an outsider most of the time. While I see other coworkers that have came and went seem to have it pretty easy joining in on the cliques. 
I feel lonely, when I try to talk to new people at parties, classes or at work I feel like I'm very boring and don't contribute much to a conversation, I can never think of what to say or always over think and watch my words, never wanting to offend. It's frustrating, I love talking to people when I'm comfortable, I'm sure everyone does; it's just so hard for me when I'm alone without a having a friend I know I can say anything to.
So this summer I'm moving and going to be actually alone for the first time, Living with brand new people and working with brand new people. I want to make friends and build relationships, not go through the motions like I have been most of my adult life, blended into the background. 
So any advice for my situation? any tips, books, videos, ways to practice and over all cure my social anxiety? "

At this point, i would be able to graduate with a First Class Honours degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in CS within 4 years. I would be looking to do the OMSCS from GT after graduating with a minor.

However, there's the option to overload, and take an additional semester to get a 2nd major in CS, but potentially losing out on a First Class GPA.

My question would be that, would a minor open enough doors for me for a career in the Big(N) companies? or is the additional semester for a 2nd major a much better option to take?"

I started an internship with a startup as a VR developer in January. I was skeptical at first, but speaking with the CEO, co-founders and then VP the company was close to being fully funded and was going to become incorporated in the next month or so. 

Fast forward to today and we are working out of an apartment (different than the proposed office space that was purchased). Learning has mainly been on my own with little mentoring by senior members. Their clear goal doesn't seem so clear and the promises of pay keep getting pushed back (was suppose to receive stipend and eventually be transitioned to normal pay last month). Basically there are flags popping up that isn't showing a great future for the company. 

So why am I still here? This is my first dev role (worked in IT for 7 years) and am still in college (final year) and I somewhat enjoy the people and am getting some experience in the development world. I've been speaking with senior members since March about what happens after the internship and was suppose to meet in May to discuss the future. That was pushed back to July/August and rumor is it will be pushed back again. 

How should I continue to approach this? Should I just walk and focus on other projects, or should I hold out and see if this meeting will be beneficial to me? "

Hi everyone,

First, I'd like to give you all a background of what happened and where I'm currently at.

I just recently failed out of a top tier Master's CS program. I was under my final probation they can give me for this semester, I needed to get a B+ or higher in my OS class to satisfy core requirements. I just got back my grade and it was a B, 8 more points on the final would've got me the B+. If I had completed with a B+, I would've had 5 more courses left to graduate. My original graduation date actually should've been this May before I had a horrible first semester failing 2 classes. I decided to get an MS because I changed to CS mid-way through my bachelors and my school had a horrible program. I had no internship experience and felt my skills weren't good enough to compete on the job market. 

I now have around 90k in student loan debt, no internship experience and no diploma to show for it. The only job experience I had was a volunteer developer role (unpaid) last summer-fall doing C# Windows applications. I have 2 projects from my MS courses, and a few unfinished side projects (that I really should finish).

I've failed time and time again to get an internship. Met with career advisors, went to fairs and never got an offer. I only had 1 in-person interview with a startup and lost it to a more qualified student. I had 3 other phone interviews; 1 with ZocDoc: They wanted to interview me but I was on my way out of the country for a tech Fellowship. Said they would interview me when I came back if there was still room, but there wasn’t. 1 with a startup where I messed up by saying “shit” and another one where I felt I did a good job but they decided not to pursue. Everyone else never responded to my application.

I am now lost on what’s next. I know I need to shore up my portfolio and GitHub, then complete my side projects and apply for jobs. But even after doing that, I don’t know if I would even get any interviews considering I couldn’t even get many for an internship. I also don’t know how to put this uncompleted degree on my resume. Then if I somehow do get the interview offer; I don’t feel I’m good enough to succeed in it and I have no idea how to tell them that I failed my MS program.

Thank you in advance to whoever takes time out of their busy lives to help me out with some advice. "

My only professional coding experiences have been with a company that I did two internships with, but I was not directly contributing to their code-base because these were 'special projects' and I pretty much developed most of the code myself (they didn't fit into a larger code-base).

The jobs I apply for require algorithmic knowledge about areas of robotics which I have directly been working on for my PhD, however, ultimately they tell me they prefer someone with X years of C++ experience in a professional setting even if that person doesn't have the algorithmic knowledge that is needed.

I have been looking at various laptops for the past week or so and have had troubles looking for a laptop that I can use for programming. I am currently attending college and have a nice gaming desktop that I have been using for all my classes but I have an internship out of state this summer so I am not going to be able to bring it along with me.


First off, I had some questions regarding specs as I was looking at laptops. Is a 13.3"" screen too small to program on? (I use dual 23"" monitors on my desktop at home). Will a dual core processor be able to run an ubuntu virtualbox (or should I just dual boot) and will 8 gigs be enough to do so?


Questions aside, my budget is $1500 but I would like it to be well under that amount if possible. My requirements are that it want it to be sleek and portable and have a screen big enough to program on (13.3"" or 15.6""?). A nice keyboard and screen are definitely a plus if I am going to be programming a lot! Also, it would be nice to be able to run over watch and league on lowest settings so I could play from time to time but that can be optional. And as stated earlier, I want it to be powerful enough to run an ubuntu virtualbox. It doesn't have to be super powerful because I have my desktop when I get back.

SOooo I'm a comp sci major and a freshman, looking for a interesting/fun coding project to do this summer. Couldn't land an internship :(  so here I am!

The only game I play now is Unreal Tournament, and we have a discord chat where the community sets, organizes and plays pick up games. They are usually heated and fun, but with support for the future of the game fluctuating as its been in Pre Alpha for a few years now, I thought my idea *might* encourage more playing and invite more spectators and potential players:

How about we introduce organized wagering? Teams are picked and small bets ($10 at most) placed by spectators for which side they think will win. Players on both teams too, can decide, and collectively place an agreed (maybe standard fixed?) and equal amount of money (maybe lower limit here? $5 per player at most).

Now, reading back through what I just wrote and considering how small the community currently is, I suspect this is somewhat a dumb idea, and I don't expect it to get anywhere. I JUST WANT TO SPEND THE SUMMER MAKING SOMETHING FOR FUN AND LEARN.

I'm hoping, if it fails in the UT community, I can try it with other more popular games such as Rocket League, Overwatch, CSGO, etc. 

I've already begun an app template for it and right now I want to understand exactly what I need to build so even if it doesn't get anywhere, it's usable, good, and most of all, works :D

Most of you here are PC gamers, and right now that's really the only set of gamers I'll be aiming for.  How does this sound? Is it something that you would use, recommend, or even consider? or does it just sound stupid. I don't care, I'm building this either way, I just want to hear from you guys :D

But besides that, Does anyone know any actual web dev/app dev classes in the Bay Area for me to attend this summer (not online, but at a college, or school, or something like that)?

A lot of you guys on here said that getting an internship as a high schooler is near impossible, so although i haven't completely lost hope on an internship (i still occasionally send my resume to a web dev firm when i stumble upon one, but I'm not madly searching for a company), my MAIN focus is finding a course or camp to complete over the summer where I learn more web dev/app dev (as that is what I want to major in college). 

The price can't be too expensive (my family isn't rich), but any reasonable price should be fine. I would prefer working with other students around my age in the summer course as well (I am 17 btw), but besides that I am pretty flexible. 

Appreciate the help!

I am getting ready to apply to graduate schools next year for a masters in computer science (or something closely related). My top choice is Stanford MSCS / Stanford Symbolic Systems. I have great extracurriculars in my opinion (4 internships at Google, Microsoft Research, Facebook, NVidia Research, 1 publication with another 2 on the way, predicting great LORs), but my transcript is lackluster. Although my GPA is decent (3.75 major overall), I received mediocre marks on a few key classes including:

Introduction Proofs/Discrete course: B
Core Algorithms/Discrete course: B+
Core Compilers course: B+

I've gotten about 50/50 A's/A-'s for my other computer science courses, but most notably I have received A+'s for all 4 HCI Courses I have taken, including a graduate level HCI course. However, out of the 5 course classes in my curriculum, I have received B's in three of them (above) and A's in two.

How difficult would it be for me to get into Stanford MSCS / Symbolic Systems? Will my mediocre grades in core cs classes be a substantial roadblock, and will my great grades in my subject of interest have any effect on counterbalancing?

Also: Which of Stanford MSCS and Stanford Symbolic Systems is easiest to get into? My research interests fit in both, but Stanford only allows applicants to apply to one.

Is there anything that I can do to increase my chances for getting into a top-tier cs graduate school (UIUC and MIT as well) in the next 6 months, specifically pertaining to my transcript?

Thanks!

I'm interning at an IBaB in a shadow IB rotational program for a month or two this summer (sophomore). My grades are OK at best, but going into recruiting I'll most likely have a ~3.4/3.5 cumulative GPA and a 3.7 or 3.8 in my double major (finance and stats). I can take two classes this summer which may boost my GPA a bit higher, but that's at the risk I'd be taking courses DURING said IB internship. The summer courses are naturally easier, but this would be with an internship where I'm commuting and working decently long hours.

Do I eat the GPA, skip the summer courses and continue to try and network or should I try and bulk up on one or two classes during my internship to bolster the GPA a bit higher heading into recruiting this summer/fall?

EDIT1: I should specify that I meant this was a decision on whether I should take summer classes in addition to the internship or not take the classes at all... not necessarily one or the other.

EDIT2: So, I did all the calculating out AND I'll only have a 3.5 (cumulative) GPA if I were to take the 2 additional classes during said IB internship (and obviously do well). Otherwise I'm stuck w/ a 3.4 which is below certain banks cutoffs for recruiting. "

Do you think it's worth it or should I just go to Waterloo? The problem I have with Waterloo is that it seems like its only advantage (coop) is completely dependent on the skill of the student and since I don't know how to code, I wouldn't be surprised if I graduate without any Big 4/Cali experience and then doing 6 or less coops at no name companies is just not as exciting. But with Berkeley, if I don't land amazing internships at least I have the prestige of the school and possibility of URA/grad school open. Also, since the students and profs in EECS are stronger, maybe I will learn quicker and be inspired in different ways. I am looking for advice from students who were in my position before or are knowledgeable about the differences between UW CS and Berkeley EECS. Thanks.

What I'd also like to know is whether Waterloo is comparable in terms of prestige (in industry) to Berkeley.

I'm currently at a point where I am not quite sure what to do in the terms of achieving a dream of mine to work as a web developer. I have applied to about 10 to 20 positions close to my local area (northern part of Sweden, which makes the job opportunities slim) and from those I have completed 3 interviews (making final stage on one) and one offer for an unpaid internship (which I could not accept at the time due to financial reasons). So my job search hasn't gone all that well and I have been thinking that I may need to get something up on my resume to showcase that I know a certain area. During the interviews my theoretical and practical coding abilities was not short off from what I applied for (junior webdev positions) and that they had found someone just a little bit better than me. Most probably the person they hired over me had completed College or something similar which I have not.

I have noticed my motivation has been going down lately, I no longer feel that drive to just hop in to my IDE and build something off the bat. This could be because of me switching over to the Node/JS ecosystem from .NET and being completely overwhelmed by the many packages/addons/plugins/frameworks that are out there. 

I simply just go play games or something other rather than working on a website for example, the motivation is just on the bottom at the moment and I am not sure why.

My options are the following...

1. Go to school (Not university/college, this is a type of school that teaches a specific job in Sweden such as a web developer, somewhat like a bootcamp but under the time period of 1 to 2 years.)

2. Coding bootcamps

3. Continue on as self-taught and/or start working freelance.

I can afford (barely) to take a coding bootcamp and to me this looks like the best option due to how popular they have become. Mainly I have been looking at Thinkful and their flexible web dev program for 6 months and it looks very professional and they have a job guarantee (if I decide to relocate to the US and get a visa) which is probably not happening during my junior years as a web dev but still the stats look good!

I'd love to hear from anyone that has been or know someone in a similar position, I love web development and creating stuff for the web but my motivation is failing me recently.

Suffolk:
+ I am currently on an internship right on the same block as Suffolk and stopping it in a half a month. If I go to Suffolk, I can stick it out longer during school times.
+ It's by the statehouse. I am sure this would allot me more opportunities with politics.
+ Very easy to visit family with the school being near South Station.
+ Offering me about 8,000 a semester.
+ &gt;10k students. I like campuses where it feels more tight-knit.
- I don't like the idea of being in a city. I love Boston. I don't want to be where there's no good greenery.
- Specializes mostly with law. Not something I have total interest in, but I do have a lot of classes that favor it.

UMA:
+ More green. I love that and it would relax me better.
+ It has a connection with three schools I applied for originally. (Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke).... allowing me to take classes at these schools.
+ I have a friend here for business and another friend going to Amherst, so that would be nice.
- Very far out west of Mass so less family interaction. I don't own a car nor can I afford it right now.
- 28k people. Not as cozy.


I want to go to this college for one semester and hopefully transfer to another in the following. I missed my application cut off for most schools this semester, so I am trying to choose the best ""temp"" school with better benefits. What do you think? I mean, Suffolk seems like the ideal candidate, but I really want to go for UMass because I hate the idea of city life.

6cgq82,9,2017-05-21,Is this normal Asian parents behavior?,kawaiife,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6cgq82/is_this_normal_asian_parents_behavior/,"Hello nice reddit people. I would like to ask if my ultra-crazy Chinese parents' behavior is normal. I'm a 21-year-old girl, I am in university, and I am also a part-time lifestyle writer for various publications, simply because I like to write, and the money comes in handy anyway. Since I write for events and stuff, I need to attend these said events. That being said, my mom would usually offer to fetch me to the event, and she goes ballistic when I tell her that she doesn't need to. Whenever I say no she will scream and ask why, and accuse me of meeting my (brown) boyfriend there. Whenever I give a reason, ""The train reaches there,"" for example, she will say, ""That is just an excuse!"" or ""You are lying! You just want to see that guy!""

For context: in a previous thread ""Chinese Parents won't let me date Indian boyfriend,"" which I will update when I have good news, I mentioned that my parents hate my boyfriend. 

After she fetches me to the event, she will wait outside or in the car where she can ""keep an eye on me."" Since I'm working anyway, so I'm not doing anything bad. Some events can stretch up to five or six hours, and she will just sit and wait. Sometimes the event ends at 5PM but as writers, we have to gather information and regroup or something, she will begin to call me on my cellphone and I'll be damned if I don't pick it up.

After the event she will berate me for making her wait, but like, I pointed out that it was her choice to wait, not mine, and she said stuff about ""sacrificing so much for you and you don't appreciate.""

One time I had an assignment in another state for three days, and my mom followed, all the way. Stayed in the same hotel and stuff. When I said she didn't need to, she accused me of seeing my boyfriend and pretending to work. My boyfriend never follows me to work, by the way. He has his own job. LOL.

One time when I promised to go for an event and write for it, my mom couldn't fetch me due to some reason, and I was like, ""OK I'll go myself."" She started yelling at me, and didn't let me go out, and told me not to be angry with her because it was my fault anyway, since she told me beforehand that she couldn't fetch me (she did, but I said I could go myself and she pretended she couldn't hear). I had to make up an excuse because I couldn't go for the event, which means that I'd risk earning the label 'flaky' as the freelance writers' community in my city is quite a close-knit one. UGH I don't want to be known as flaky.

My dad encourages my mom to do this but he doesn't follow, mainly because he is ill and cannot travel very far. Anyway, he also said something about how he can't trust me to go on my own in case I am lying. I went to prom with some girlfriends, and my mom also 'camped' outside the hotel.

It's getting embarrassing. Whenever I tell them to not do it they will yell and accuse me of lying to them. I don't need them to fetch me to work. The public transport here is pretty darn useful, and my colleagues are quite willing to help, and we show the receipts and get reimbursed anyway. My parents are also making me refuse an internship offer for one of the nation's biggest publications, but I've been training with them and writing for them since I was 16 :( I'm so sad.

I think my mom and dad are a bit crazy and over-protective and shouty and they beat (not as often as they yell at me, but sometimes). I feel trapped. 

I want to know if this is normal parenting behavior and if there is anything I can do about this. Thank you."

Even though Canadian universities are much cheaper, CS at good schools (Waterloo, Toronto) are extremely difficult to get into while decent schools (UBC, McGill) don't have direct entry from high school. Just as a personal preference, I'd rather not gamble getting into my program of choice. In addition, these Canadian schools lack funding and I always hear about how students can never get into the classes they want/need.

My family moving to California after I graduate so I'm looking at American colleges. My dad is actually working there right now, on a TN visa. The thing is, I'm going to need a student visa to get internships so I'll be paying international fees no matter where I go (I'm pretty sure at least, if anyone can correct me, please do).

So my search has led me to UIUC, a well-respected school in the field. As much as I want to believe the school doesn't matter, I feel like it really does, especially in today's economy. I'm fairly certain I can get in. Anyway, I took a look at the courses and clubs and they seem amazing. Better than what I would get here in Canada.

But now here's my dilemma. Throughout my degree, there will be 152k USD difference in the cost than if I go to most Canadian schools. I have a wealthy aunt I can lend from with no interest and my parents have saved a good chunk for my education so money isn't a huge problem. It's just that I have no idea whether or not that amount justifies a better education. What do you guys think?

Sorry for spewing all this out on the subreddit, I'm just unsure of how to proceed.

I am 21 years old and as long as I can remember I have been extremely lazy. I will do anything to postpone an assignment to the last minute. It goes as far that I will make the assignment at 3 am at night when it needs to be done that same day. I always have more than enough time to make the assignments but somehow my brain is hardwired to postpone. Sometimes I have the feeling my personality and life have been built around being lazy.


I have never had a hard time at school and if I would be able to start working on tasks right away I would easily finish everything way before the deadlines. This however is something I am incapable of. I am studying computer science and my laziness is starting to reach it's peak. If I continue this way I will need another half year to finish my study (It may even be to late to prevent this and here I am on reddit instead of working on my assignments).


I have read all the basic tips on getting motivated (create milestones, reward yourself for achievements, etc) but I just seem incapable of doing any of it. The moment I try to get some work done I will get distracted to the point I won't finish it. When I am forced to work at my job for 40 hours a day (Back when I was doing my internship) I would just work 1.5-2.5 hours a day max and nobody seemed to notice (they even gave me a part-time job while I am finishing my studies). I believe I can achieve a lot if I would just be able to study multiple hours a day without getting distracted. Right now on average I study 1 hour a day (most weeks even less).


At the moment my free time is mostly spend like this:
50% listening to music
20% gaming
20% browsing the internet
10% doing stuff with friends (mostly weed (started 1 year ago))

I came in this Winter (Jan 2017) and studying an intensive 1 year post grad course. I did not leave on the best of terms with my family, but I thought I'd manage fine here as my college fees was taken care off by my family and plus as an international student I had a recurring deposit setup (GIC) setup which took care of rent and groceries and stuff.

Anyways I arrived here and found out my course was far too intensive to work part time so I mostly just slogged in college and didn't really have any major issues for the past few months. However I found out that since I did not have summer off, I went for a nice trip to Montreal in my break week (last week of April before Summer class could start) which ended up being far more expensive than I intended. At the time, my parents knowing how hard I studied told me to go have fun and that they'd pay for it. However, after I was back they changed their mind. Not wanting to owe people money I mostly settled as much as I could with cash from the GIC, but I also ended up paying like 500 dollars worth of other stuff for them so I don't owe them anything in addition to my own expenses.

------------------------------------
So heres how it stands, as of right now-
#1 - I have 450 on 1 Credit Card and I have 250 on another 500 Credit Card.
#2 - I have no money to last me till the end of the month although my groceries are in order so I should be able to survive.
#3 - Every month I get 670 from my GIC, out of which 500 goes to rent and groceries. Which means I have 170 extra.
#4- Working part time is not an option as my course is very intensive. I'm in college 24x7 doing assignments. I could work part time, but I'd risk falling behind and ruin my GPA which is currently at a 3.7/4. Plus I don't want to distract myself because .... (read below)

#5 - I have mandatory internship in the Fall. My GPA is excellent and my professors love me so I'm probably going to land a paid internship and even if that doesn't work out, I'd be working as something somewhere so I'd start earning in September for sure.

#6 -So can I carry this credit card debt with me till September without taking a hit on my credit score? My minimum payments on each credit card are just 15 dollars and I can make that easily.

#7- I'm scared the most about my credit score- I've been told that as a student you don't get a credit score until you've lived here for 6 months and that date is coming up next month. I'm worried about what this will do to my upcoming credit score.

EDIT-

#8- Borrowing is not an option. I don't have any family or friends who would lend me that kind of money. My classmates would lend me, but not enough to solve this problem plus I'm sure they have their own expenses and issues. I have spent the past month trying to convince my parents to pay for it and do it for me this one last time but they have firmly refused to do so - I'm concerned that there are other factors going on back home that they are not telling me about because I'm sure they would not willingly do this to me. In any case I am mostly on my own.

I've had 4 internships at startups before this and I'm looking for an internship preferably or a full time role at a good company in the US / Canada. 

Just for some more background, I've done a lot of projects and some friends have told me that my 'GitHub is stellar' and have had some good enough competitive programming experience too, and have won a few 'medals' on HackerRank contests. I've been hustling so hard, have a super active LinkedIn profile and have been cold emailing recruiters / employees at the top companies for a referral or an opportunity to work at their company, somehow all my efforts are falling short and I'm on the verge of a horrible mental breakdown. 

I had always aspired to work at the ""Big 'n'"" since freshman, somehow I got serious by the time i was at the end of my sophomore year and have been consistently programming since then. Preparing for interview / doing side projects and everything that would be fun and challenging. Programming has become my life and there is not even a single day i remember not opening up my laptop and writing a line of code. When I see my other friends chilling most of the times and interning at the giants every summer, it fills me up with envy and makes me feel that I'm not putting in much efforts, regardless of checking off everything of what every company would desire their ideal candidate to be. It's frustrating to see how I've been hustling for the past 2.5 years, compensating on my social life, giving less love to my parents (they're senior citizens and I live with them) and obsessing myself with work and everything CS to get that one dream job which I always felt short off. It isn't the glamour or the fact that I've not got that job at Google, its just that it has been a dream of mine to surround myself with really smart people and being in the valley would satiate those desires. I was there last month and there was not even a single moment I felt I was out of place, not even a single moment I had missed home. 

Coming to the point here, I'm super worried about my future and now most friends in my college (I go to a terrible college, where most of my classmates cannot even write a simple bug free fizzbuzz program even after they graduate) look up to me and always feel that I would be working at the best company in the world (I kinda have to blame myself for the public accountability).

I just want to know why do such bad things happen to me? Why don't I get such cool opportunities? What is it that I have which most interns / people who recently started working at the Big 'n' have and I don't? 
I can tell you that I'm super confident and an extrovert and can have a conversation with anyone at anytime without being scared and have tried everything to showcase my skills to the world to notice me (don't judge me that since I haven't been socializing with friends, I would be an introvert).

I need some serious help and I'm on the verge of giving up and just not sure of what to do next. 

Thanks for reading through! :) "

I've finished two years of schooling now, and due to some family dynamics I've been trying to graduate and become independent as quickly as possible. This has paid off since I'm set to graduate in Spring 2018, just one year from now...BUT I haven't had any luck with internships or the like this summer or last summer. So, three questions:

1) In order to make up for the lack of real world experience, I figure I should do some good work on the side. However, I'm not sure what is really going to be a good enough personal project to make up for that sort of thing. I've done a few things that were just single file programs that weren't too exceptional. How big/fancy does a project have to be to have significant weight on a resume?

2) I know I should also get active on Github, but whenever I look at repositories it all just looks like gibberish. To me, it just looks like a bunch of folders with cryptic names and I can never figure out how to actually use it or find where I can contribute. I've tried reading tutorials on contributing but I still feel like a dummy, lol. Any helpful tips/links would be appreciated.

3) In regards to my plans next year, I could a) graduate in the spring and look for a job or b) delay graduating until that fall in hopes of getting a summer internship. That would of course increase my student debt and be a longer time delay for a stable job, however, and there's still the chance I wouldn't even get an internship. Opinions?"

I just finished my sophomore year( finance major) and just created my LinkedIn profile.  Right now it is mostly empty as I don't have any finance experience or internship. I am really regret that I didn't try harder to get internship this summer. So my plan for this summer is taking summer classes, learning  excel, and networking. I'm planning on using LinkedIn for networking but I don't know what to write on my LinkedIn profile on the work experience part. I'm worry that I won't make any good impression with my profile and people don't want to connect with me. Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can do to make my profile more attractive?


Also sorry if this question sounds stupid but when you try to connect with alumni from your school, do you just add a brief introduction message and ask to connect with them? 

Last question: I went to some networking events​ last semester. I got their email address and already sent follow up email to all of them. I want to keep in touch with them so they won't forget about me this coming fall recruiting season but I don't know how. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you!
Feel free to ask me any questions if you need more details."

Anyway, I finished up my degree in Information Systems this past December and I've taken a wide range of classes: cybersecurity, project management, mobile app development, Python, C++, software development, databases, networking, etc. I've also had an internship for about 2.5 years doing database development and writing up web reports and web applications using Oracle's Application Express.

The thing is, it's not the highest thing on my list of potential career options. I know how to do it, but I'm not too big a fan of it. At this point, if I was offered a job doing that kind of work, I'd take it because I'm really honestly getting desperate, but it's just not something I see myself doing in the next five to ten years. I just don't like software development. Eventually I want to be able to get into cybersecurity (for which I need certifications), or some kind of administration role like system admin or database admin. How do I get my foot in the door for those kinds of positions when I have absolutely no experience outside of taking a couple classes here and there? Is it really all just about your connections at that point?

And another question (actually my main one and it's the one that's really getting to me):

As I said, I graduated this past December. I've applied to hundreds of jobs. I've had a good number of interviews and then they never call back or they just say ""we've decided to move along with other candidates"". I know the resume is important as a first impression, and I think I have that down (maybe just need a few tweaks here and there but I've had my resume critiqued by a handful of people since like September) because I am getting noticed by recruiters and hiring managers alike. This is why I feel like my problem lies in the interviewing process. I do my best to sell myself and I emphasize that I'm always open to learning new things and taking on new opportunities. And these are entry-level positions I'm applying to, so, I mean...isn't that mainly what they're looking for? Is there something else? I don't mean for that to come off negatively, I'm just genuinely trying to figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong. Most, if not all of the people I've graduated with have found jobs by now and it's just really disheartening and it's stressing me out and I feel like I should have found something by now. Even when I tell people that I haven't found anything their first response is, ""really? *still?!*"" and idk. that's disheartening as fuck lmao. I'm tired of bumming around at home doing nothing lol. Thanks for reading this far and I appreciate any help I can get.

This happened years ago when I was an intern at a beach resort hotel. I was assigned to the sailing team where we take care of the private beach and have a bunch of [catamarans](https://www.annecy-aventure.com/files/img/album/ac7c3b92a5ad9/w/219a64c47e_610x400a.jpg) where we loan it out to guests who knows how to sail one or we sail it with guests on board.

&amp;nbsp;

One day, there was a couple from Taiwan on our beach. The dude was a tiny skinny Chinese guy who couldn't speak a word of English while his pretty hot girlfriend could speak a little (she has a ton of tattoos and I have a thing for inked girls). They walked up to our sailing shed all dressed up in beach wear and naturally they approached me because I was the only Asian Chinese dude standing amongst 5 other dudes who were from Maldives &amp; Bali hoping I could speak Chinese. Although myself being Asian Chinese, I grew up speaking English and only practiced Chinese when I conversed with my Grandparents so I would say my language proficiency was about 3/10? The conversation went 90% between me and the girl because it was a mix of English and Chinese and only we could understand each other, her boyfriend pretty much stood quiet and let his girl do the talking. They wanted a ride on the catamaran and I'll be sailing them. 
  
Safety protocols on top of wearing life jackets, we ask our guests if they can swim and if they can't we usually do not allow them on the catamarans just in case it capsized. The girl can swim, the guy couldn't. She asked if it's still a good idea to head out the ocean. I was cool about it and boasted there hasn't been any capsize for years which eventually led to convincing her to let me take them out. Talked to my supervisor who eventually let me take them out on the waters on condition I sail slow and just nearby. Also cause our private beach lies in a cove and waters are usually very calm. Agreed and we went on to choose our boats.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward about 45minutes later when myself, the girl and her boyfriend were already sailing on the sea waters. We're sitting in positions where I'm at the back where the rudder is, while the girl and dude were sitting across each other, one on the left and one to the right of the catamaran to spread the weight out. The whole time the girl was asking me how I got into the sailing team, what the rudder does, etc etc, sailing experiences seeing I'm only 23years old. So naturally I wanted to look cool while sailing, wearing a wet suit and Oakley sunglasses and all so I boasted a little and we shared some laughs and stuff and I tried to speak chinese as much as I could. Wasn't long before the dude told his girl to tell me that he wanted to try sailing the boat.
  
Sailing a catamaran is pretty easy so we usually let guests try their hands on while we're out sailing. Anyone who has sailed this before would know that weight distribution is important as the catamaran tends to lean on either side depending on where you're turning/where the wind is caught on the sails. 

&amp;nbsp;

My first FU. Trying to act cool speaking a language I barely mastered. I confidently said ""OK no problem"" in chinese and paused a little thinking how do I say ""hold on, switch places with your girlfriend when I tell you so"". The dude slid over from his side over to me assuming I've completed my sentence, and all the weight of 3 people gathered on 1 side of the boat, FLIPPING us over. The next 2 minutes were just all filled with screams, seawater up nostrils, confusion and struggles to get back up to the surface.

&amp;nbsp;

My second FU. I didn't buckle my life jacket because it looked cool unbuckled. Because of this, the life jacket was pulling me up by my armpits underwater. I struggled in the water as I rushed to buckle the jacket under water. This involves pulling your own weight up by pushing down on the life jacket to buckle. To top it off, there's the underhook buckle where it extends from the back of the life jacket, in between your legs to the buckle in the front. I gave myself an underwater wedgie pulling the buckle from between my legs up to the buckle at the front. Hurt as hell tugging on a strap which ran along my ass crack and over my jewels, squashing them in the process.

&amp;nbsp;

Located my guests, the dude hanging onto his girlfriend like a monkey hugging a tree. Swam up to them and told them everything will be OK and apologized profusely. Girl had a huge ""No capsizes my ASS!"" on her face. Supervisor noticed us capsized, and was already speeding towards us with the life boat. Realized my Oakleys are off from my head and somewhere with the fishes. Brought guests back to shore and headed back out to retrieve the capsized catamaran with my supervisor while being screwed along the way for not being careful enough. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Brought guest sailing on a catamaran, communicated poorly in a language I'm really poor at, miscommunication caused us to flip, lost my Oakley sunglasses in the process, gave myself an underwater wedgie and hurt my precious orbs, embarrassment and scolding from supervisor.

I've taken courses in data structures, object-oriented software development, as well as a couple of statistics and machine learning courses.

I, however, do not have any work experiences. In Ontario, Canada, companies receive tax benefits from the government if they hire students enrolled in a co-op program, and I wasn't, so it was. very difficult to get an internship.

I know people will most of the times say side projects are better, but I am learning A LOT from studying MCSA SQL (70-461). But I do wonder if this certification an overkill for someone who is looking for entry level position. I'm definitely going to finish the first book, but I'm not sure if companies want a junior to know all SSIS/SSAS/SSRS.

For projects, I have

- Machine learning models in Python
- (To be completed at the end of this semester) Either EM/MCMC/Other simulation methods in R
- Various types of neural networks in C++ using OOP
- Personal Project in Algebraic Statistics

But these projects aren't big. All less than 1K lines of codes. I am not sure if my projects are enough to get an interview or am I better of studying for certifications?

Thanks for any advice.

Fast forward two years and now I was moved from intern to ""contractor"" basically because I graduated. The contracting company (same one with internship) did not offer benefits, so I never got any.

However recently the contracting company have started to offer two plans: (1) simple paid holidays (2) more holidays paid plus PTO days.

Growing up, I was a hard working student and always saw myself having a successful career in technology. Unfortunately, my parents didn’t share my view and told me in high school that my only option was to be a medical doctor. It was for “family respect” as I was their “investment.” Also I’m Indian and apparently this type of stuff is common. My dad messed up my college applications pretty bad as well. He said the essays I wrote were crap since they didn’t emphasize medicine so he made me rewrite them and they were so impersonal that I was rejected from all the prestigious colleges. I still got into one college which I ended up attending.

So one year of college goes by and I finish most of my premed courses with straight As but I hate the thought of being a doctor. I’m not interested in helping people clinically. So when I come home for summer break, I tell my parents I’m not going to be a doctor and they respond that they will not support me financially. I stay firm and say no because I hate medicine. I would rather eat dirt than be a doctor for my family’s respect. Finally my dad tries to compromise with me. He says I go to medical school for 4 years and do whatever I want after that (so no residency in his words). I’m hesitant at first but I accept (in retrospect this was a really bad idea but other than the army I wasn’t sure how to pay for college). I do 4 years of college and get into an American medical school. It was not an easy process in the sense that my dad tried to micromanage everything. He prevented me from taking any internships because I “should always be studying,” gave me no phone until I was a senior, broke my laptop before finals which tanked one of my semester grades, looked through my school emails without my knowledge for quite some time, and gave me really bad advice from time to time with the most infamous that I “shouldn’t waste time shadowing.” 

Anyways, the week before I’m supposed to leave for medical school my dad tells me he has changed his mind and I “have no choice but to do residency.” He had totally reneged on his promise. I was so mad when he told me that I just stared at him thinking about how I can choke him. 

So now I’m seriously considering moving out. This whole process has taken a huge toll on me psychologically and made me slightly suicidal. I know that my mental health will only get worse if I go to medical school and I will take someone’s spot that deserves to be there. However, I only have 3 months to make money. How much money should I make to be in a safe zone before I move out? Or should I just take the hit and go to medical school and then be kicked out within a year from that one? Has anyone dealt with this situation before? Did their parents try to track them down? Also, don’t tell me that I should try to talk to my parents. I did that multiple times and nothing changed."

I like what I'm studying, and I am happy with my progress so far, but there are a few problems.

Summer vacation is coming and I am really motivated to use this time to improve myself as a computer scientist. I have been thinking about starting a personal project or becoming a freelancer, but I just don't know where to start and on top of that, I feel like I don't have the skills for it. I know Java and Python, my programming module focused on these 2 languages, and C++ at a more basic level, but I feel like I could easily learn it if needed. Other modules I have done this year include micro-controller programming(using a Raspberry Pi I have created a combination lock safe, and a lock ""pick"" that uses side-channel or dictionary attacks to break it), computer architectures, and electronics foundations.

Living in the UK is quite hard for me and especially for my family, as I am from Romania, so I want to do something that would help me support myself and lift the burden off my family's shoulders. But I don't even know where to look. Looking at the freelancer market made it seem so difficult to get into: how would I get offers with little to no experience (my only work experience is a 10-week internship done during first two terms at uni as a website tester), and even worse what if I get an offer that I'm not able to do. I feel like, even though my programming skills are good, I don't have the ability to use them to create a ""real"" application or solution to a problem.

Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated."

I am currently attending a state school in the Northeast US (tristate area) and I am trying to learn more about possible work experience during the year. I am now in the Summer after my first year and planning to go to a somewhat well known company's internship in a few weeks for the next few months.

After such a lucky break, I am curious if it's important to try and keep the ball rolling. My school doesn't regularly advertise a big internship/co-op program from my understanding, but offers some credits towards working outside of school.

However, the credits they award are 3 for an internship and 6 for a 6 month co-op and I would need to enroll as a full time student, 12 credits, to continue to accept my scholarship.

My grades have been pretty stellar, but I did my first year mostly as a sophomore in EE and am now getting into the CS track (finished more than required math/physics, but only finished intro to CS and audited Data Structures). I am curious if it's feasible to try for more work experience, but I don't know if having to commute to school or from school would work. It seems as though no major based classes would be offered online, so I would have to take the remaining 6-9+ credits as well.

Would trying to manage this be difficult? Also, how would I go about finding these job opportunities more commonly? I have used our schools job site, but are there websites that target certain states or schools?

Any and all help would be very appreciated!"

There are other students working in the morning and I work in the afternoon with another intern in every other day.

This morning a student brought in a laptop, one of our 1to1 machines, which we fix all the time and the morning team asks him what was up with it. He says he spilled Orange Juice on it, which makes this the third non water spill this year, which are not easy to deal with. I was informed that-

 &gt; ""He threw down his backpack and you could hear a sloshing in there, there was a lot of liquid""

He pulled his computer out which was dripping with OJ. The morning crew threw out his case immediate because there was no point in keeping it and we have oodles of extras. He informed them that he wanted to have his father fix it, and by fix it he said, 

 &gt; ""We were gonna dry it out in a bowl of rice""

Keeping in mind this is a Laptop, and it was soaked in OJ. He did get to take his Calculator (a $100 graphing calculator last time I checked the price) home and do the rice ""trick."" He then complained to them that he wanted a loaner laptop. We give out loaners under the circumstance that you didn't break your computer or it is something minor that you pay for. He didn't bring the money to replace his computer because he expected a loaner. The morning crew said that he was just a general ass about it, keeping in mind that this was a ninth grader talking to upperclassmen doing their job.

Fast forward to my block, I walk in to our room (more of a closet) and see the computer in a plastic bag, with OJ pooled in with the computer and the IT guy with me today walks in and shakes his head. He explains the situation to me and we get to work on the computer because despite the fact that the kid was an ass, we're supposed to see if we can fix it and spare him the $500 fee for trashing a computer. We worked on it for about an hour, getting it apart and cleaning things off before he tells me to go clean the case in the bathroom, because there aren't any other sinks I have access to. I wash it and we spend the rest of the block joking about trashed computer and how the hell it happened.

Edit 2: Followup post is finicky apparently, TL;DR somehow fixed and works, but he will need to pay for a keyboard panel, a couple buttons on it are shot. Took his repair bill from $650 to $150 (I don't think his fix for the call will work)."

I've been looking for a job for 9 months but haven't had much luck in that department. I've had 2 internships before I graduated too. Anyway, now that I'm graduated, I can't help feeling like I messed up, especially because a good amount of my friends have jobs lined up already. Meanwhile, I've only had 3 on-site job interviews. As far as I can tell jobs for new graduates at this time of the year are more scarce and are harder to look for, presumably because companies have filled those roles already. I can't pinpoint what I'm doing wrong either: my resume is OK (not just according to me lulz), done mock interviews and studied resources in depth (Cracking the Coding Interview, leetcode). 

Anyway long story short, how badly have I messed up and what are my options from here? My plan this summer besides looking for jobs is to keep studying for interviews and do a project or 2 on my own time. Will a recruiter hold the fact that I didn't have a job after I graduated against me, if say I don't have a job by the Fall? (UIUC allows recent graduates to attend the career fairs up to a year after graduation). In general, I'm getting really frustrated because it's been so long and almost nothing has come up.

Should I take it or wait for something better?",forbesms,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6crozs/ive_been_jobhunting_for_six_months_and_am_being/,"**""TL/DR""**: *I've been offered a job outside of my field that I am not interested in at all, but I've been job hunting for six months for a professional position, and my career counselor suggested this job to me and wrote a letter of recommendation for me for this job. There are several pros and cons to accepting the job (listed below), but I'm leaning towards not taking it. Reasons for this include very bad Glassdoor reviews, lack of interest in the position, and not enough time to find a place to live in the city the job is located in. However, I am not sure if declining this job is the best decision, and am asking for advice or feedback regarding my circumstance. Currently, my part-time bartending job is able to pay my bills, and I'm corresponding with a couple of other companies as well.*

_____________________________________________________________________________

Hey all, I’m hoping you guys can help me with a really hard decision I’m trying to make.

*A bit of background to begin:* I graduated from university with my Bachelor’s degree back in December 2016, with a major in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Supply Chain Management. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA and two completed internships behind me; however, I have had a lot of trouble with finding a full-time job, and currently work part-time as a bartender. I’ve actually made it to the final round of several interviews, often being among the final three candidates, but have always been passed up in favor of someone else. I believe it’s because my social anxiety causes me to be extremely anxious when interviewing, which doesn’t give off the best impression.

Because of my difficulty with finding a job, I set up several appointments with a career counselor at my alma mater to help me with my interviewing skills and to see if she knew of any other job leads. In our last meeting last week, she at one point asked me, “Have you ever thought about working in insurance claims?”

I hadn’t thought of doing that line of work at all. I really wanted to do something in my field, whether its business consulting or logistics, and working in insurance didn’t appeal to me at all. But I decided to keep an open mind to it and lull it over in my head. The next day, my career counselor told me to apply for a specific “Claims Adjuster” job at a major insurance company, and she wrote for me a letter of recommendation. I wasn't very interested, but I did it because she suggested it, and I thought it was worth learning more about at least. I received a call that afternoon from the company. The manager I spoke to said that they are “aggressively” hiring for their next training group, which starts on June 5, and invited me to interview at the office the following Monday (May 22).

The interview went well overall and, at the end, the manager I spoke to initially said that he was going to have the HR people extend an offer to me – I’m expecting to receive that the 23rd or later this week.

_____________________________________________________________________________

To try to make this post less wordy, I’ve made a list of what I perceive to be pros and cons related to this opportunity.

*PROS*

- Good Pay – approx. $40-45k starting out

- Full-Time Professional Job, which is what I’ve been searching for

- Good training program that includes taking an exam to get a license to work in insurance

- The office is located in a bigger city that I wouldn’t mind living in

- Nice, modern office

- The employees that I spoke to seemed nice

*CONS*

- Insurance claims is not related to my field of study *at all* (information systems and supply chain management), and I know that I will hate going into work every day doing a job that I couldn’t care less about. Not only am I not interested in the line of work, but I don't see how working in insurance would further my career goals. 

- The Glassdoor reviews for this position at this particular office are abysmal. There are multiple posts, spanning over the course of months and years, that say things like this: The work/life balance is non-existent, the workload is unmanageably high (which I confirmed during my interview via a comment made by one manager I spoke with), several accounts of people having emotional breakdowns at work due to the stress, and very high turnover rate, among other issues. Several of them explicitly say “Do not work here”. As someone who suffers from depression and is highly susceptible to stress, the reviews have really turned me off of the company and make me afraid to accept the offer. I don’t want a job that I dread going to every day. I understand that no job is perfect, but I want there to be at least some degree of enjoyment in my work. I don’t think that I would enjoy working in insurance claims.

- The new hire training session for this quarter starts on June 5, less than two weeks away. That’s barely enough time for me to put in my two-weeks notice at the part-time bartending job I currently work, and nowhere near enough time to find a (decent) place to live in this city. The first couple of weeks are also dedicated to training you on being able to pass the insurance license exam, so trying to move during that time would be extremely stressful, especially since my state apparently has one of the most strenuous exams.

- One of the guys I interviewed with made a comment along the lines of “all we ask is for one year of your time in claims” which I wasn’t sure if it meant I have to work a minimum of one year there per a contract I’d have to sign. I can ask about that when I receive the offer, but if I took the job I’d only plan to work there until I found something in my field. In addition, it isn’t fair to the company to train me only for me to leave three months later.

- Working 40-50 hours a week would mean that I have much less time to search for other jobs. While my bartending job is definitely not ideal or good-paying, it does give me flexibility so that I can take a day to go to an interview in another city.

_____________________________________________________________________________

So, I’m just really torn as to what to do. On one hand, it’s a professional job that will pay me well while I look for something else. On the other hand, I know I won’t like it or be interested in my work at all, and I’m sure that would show at some point. What do you think the best decision for me to make is? Are there other factors that I should take into consideration? I'm also concerned that my career counselor will be angry if I don't accept the job she helped me to find, and will not help me in the future. Currently I'm not in any financial trouble and can pay my bills. Thanks in advance for any advice you might give to me.

I'm finishing up my second year of my undergrad, but its looking like I'll be finishing up my degree early by the fall of my fourth year (~= two quarters early). This leaves the timing of my grad application in a bit of a flux.

I think that I have the following options:

1. Apply Fall 2017 to start Winter 2018
2. Apply Fall 2018 to start Fall 2019

My issue with the first option is that I don't know how many universities offer Winter enrollment, and I'd also like more time to build up my resume a bit before I apply. The second option would just leave me with a really long gap between finishing undergrad and starting graduate school. I would want to work during this time period, but I don't know how easy it is to apply for internships when you haven't been accepted into your next school yet. I read this [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ot62z/internship_for_the_summer_between_undergrad_and/) that seems to indicate you can, but the comments seem to indicate that its important that you can prove you're going back to school after your internship, which will be difficult for me to for Winter or Spring internships. Conceivably, I could probably work in the Fall and the graduate in Winter of 2018, but I would be in the same quandary for Spring and Summer.

Does anyone have any insight/have been in a similar situation? Thanks for any responses!"

I think it was partially fueled by my parent's high expectations and low resource input, which does not allow me to achieve those high expectations. For example, my parent's friend has a son my age who got an internship coding. They really compared me hard with this guy and the thing was, I did not have as much experience with computers since my parents tried to hide the internet from me when I was growing up. They also never got me any resources to do coding too. Everyone else in my local community had lego mindstorms and that kind of stuff growing up and the only exposure I had to any kind of high tech stuff at the time was going to conventions relevant to their job to only look at things. And then my parents would say,""If you think it is cool, you should get good grades and you can do this too."", which is extremely unsatisfying when I see everyone else getting more.


I know I wrote a previous post on me winning a coding contest, but I won that because I was creative, not because i was good a coding.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/60cz23/i_finally_won_something_but_my_parents_failed_to/

I think this internal jealousy that I had was also fueled by the friends I had in elementary and early middle school who were picked by my parents. My parents basically just said ""They are Chinese too and they have good grades, so go make friend with them."" These ""Friends"" really bullied me and my parents didn't really care about that. The ""friends"" knew that I in one of the richer families of the community and also they knew my parents were really stingy and spent the least on me, so they would call me rich boy and stuff, while I felt like the opposite.

Also, I am also a little mad, because my parents knew I had some mental disabilities while growing up and still rode the high horse on expectations. FYI I was KO for over a week in the hospital when i was little, because I had encephalitis and basically germs were directly attacking my brain and I nearly died. They expected things that a encephalitis survivor who had mild symptoms couldn't have done.

On top of that, they signed me up for classes that you can only win participation medals in those types of competitions. And when I got the participation medals, they basically shamed me for not doing better and getting real awards. I mean seriously, how can I win any better medals if all they give is participation awards?!

I know that now they have changed and I more happy because of that, but I still feel like when I was five years old and they had these expectations.

6cuncf,11,2017-05-23,Debating leaving work with good salary for grad school (STEM field). Would like to hear opinions.,damnreccaishot,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6cuncf/debating_leaving_work_with_good_salary_for_grad/,"I was wondering if anybody has any thoughts or opinions about this. I currently work at a pharma company with good salary, flexible hours, free food, and an surrounded by great people. Been with the company for 4 years as a FTE, but in reality I've been with them for close to 7 years if my internship and contractor position counts. Overall it's an excellent company to work for, something I'd probably be crazy to leave on my own account. 

The thing is I've always wanted to go to graduate school. I'm not exactly concerned about having a greater earning potential, though I would at least hope the jobs I get after won't have a severe undercut of what I currently make, and as long as the job prospects are good, I'm fine. Mainly I want to attend because the rigors of writing your own research thesis and defending your dissertation sound super interesting to me. Another is that I always feel like I don't know much compared to my current peers and always feel so unconfident, even though sometimes I feel I probably know more than them in terms of technical abilities. Just knowing that they're PhDs while I'm just a B.S makes me afraid to speak up; conversing with other scientists about the science really frightens me and I want to get better at it. A part of it is also wanting to get that advanced degree so I can feel good about myself (not gonna lie). 

I have been out of school for a while so I decided to go back and take a graduate course from my undergrad University just the past Winter quarter and got an A. I found the whole experience very refreshing. It was so different from undergrad and I'm a whole lot more invested in it this time, and though it sucked sometimes, I strangely liked how much material we were expected to read. So based on that, I think I'm really leaning towards getting a grad degree. My problem is that I always vacillate in my mood about the prospect of getting in to grad school. Sometimes I feel confident about what I've got, but more often I feel that my application packet is too weak. I do have some research experience, but in industry. I am currently in the middle of writing a paper on analytical instrumentation and I'm first author, but I'm not sure that is enough. Furthermore, I unfortunately did not seek out research opportunities at school while in undergrad since I decided to intern at my job (where I got paid lots of money for a student), so I basically have no academic contact, except for maybe that professor who taught the graduate course, but a lot of the programs I've seen require 2 letters of rec. from professors in the field...

My overall undergrad GPA was 3.0, and I think my upper division courses were at 3.2. My degree was in biochem, but my job is analytical and I've never had to use any of my biochem knowledge, so now I'm more interested in analytical, but more toward p.chem or maybe even physics. Instead of pharma, my dream is to work for the environment, mainly by researching renewable energy (focused on solar), but I am also considering staying purely analytical so atmospheric chemistry or water remediation are on the table as well. The thing is I just don't know if these tracks are even within my reach. 

I wanted to go for the PhD, but my GREs aren't that great (80th on Verbal, 59th on quant, and 4 on essay). Also my grades on the earlier physics courses, and most my math courses, were C's. I don't know if there's any value in retaking them now? I'm leaning on going for the Masters first at a local school, getting my contacts down, then applying for PhD after at a lab I'm really interested in, but of course, I'm also worried about the costs and time commitment this takes.

I just want advice as to what I should do next. Do I re-take physics/math to improve my grades, or retake the GRE, or just take the subject test, try and go straight for PhD, stay in pharma and forget about grad school, etc.? What seems the most reasonable? Thanks in advance."

Last summer I had an internship doing angular. I didn't learn much though. I felt like half the time I spent running protractor tests (automated UI tests for anyone not familiar with angular. 

This summer I'm doing research in ML at my university. My professor has learned that I'm not the best programmer. He told me to take a few steps back and just build an app and not worry about ML for now. I'm very honest and self aware of my skills according to him. He also mentioned that I'm determined and ambitious, but he said I looked frustrated. 

I was scared he would drop me from the project. He assured he wouldn't especially since I'm not getting paid. I'm just doing it for the experience. He did ask me if I even enjoyed coding and I wasn't sure. He asked me why I decided to even do this track and I said I was really interested in AI. 

I am obsessed with Ray Kurzweil and Deep Mind and I want to be a part of building the future they are creating. That's why I picked this major. He said that was pretty naive, but that it was okay. 

This meeting made my imposter syndrome go up the roof. I was always good at math growing up and the best in class in calculus. I love science and reading about math. Even though the left brain right brain theory is a myth, I feel like I'm very left brained. However, I feel like I don't even belong in this field let alone become an AI researcher.

I like reading about theoretical CS and machine learning textbooks but coding does frustrate me. It always has. My mentor said this is why I should take a few steps back and learn the practice because the theory is useless if I can't implement my own models.

My first time posting here. I'm in my third year of a Software Development Bachelor program and on my first internship work term. I'm at a small company (3 full-time employees, 1 part-time) and therefore I am the only tech person, so I do have the freedom to go with whatever programming language or framework I wish. I wish I had some guidance to see whether what  I want to do is the right way to do it.


My company is the middle-man between a home developer/contractor and the suppliers. I'm building a webpage that'll let home owners to log on, view all the products (home finishes, flooring, lighting, plumbing, etc.), select products/packages of products, choose upgrades, and then create the purchase order (create an excel table of all products/packages selected). No purchase transactions will be made on the webpage. We will need to store lots of products into a database, we have a catalogue of up to 50 thousand items. All of this is just phase 1, he wants to do even more later on


I was thinking of doing all of this in ASP .NET MVC, I do feel most confident in it for a website of this scale. I've created and hosted a few small blog websites, but I've never hosted a website this this large before and with a database. If I go with ASP .NET, is Azure the way to go for hosting/deploying? How is the pricing, the Microsoft Pricing Calculator is not very clear, it says $6.06/mo for 1 database but is that only 1 table? I'll need multiple tables(Products, Packages, Team, etc.). School did a good job of teaching me how to create a webpage, but not a very good job on how to deploy, host, and manage it afterwards.


Are there any alternative that would be better? My boss is asking my if there is anything such as shopify that would work better and be easier?

I wanted to get the community's advice and opinion on a job I'm accepting. It's a summer IT position for a school district paying $10 per hour for 8 hours Mon-Fri. The job entails setting up new PC's, laptop's, wiring, imaging devices, decommissioning old technology and other related tasks at approximately 15-20 sites.

Currently I'm a student in community college and I'm trying to get my foot into the IT field and I thought this job would be a good start to get some industry experience. However, I have applied for many other positions which include internships but this opportunity was the first to come through.

A couple questions:

1. Does the pay seem fine for a position like this, especially for someone that has had no professional experience in IT?

2. Probably a ""no-brainer"" but if a better offer comes along, such as an internship, and I've already started this position should I accept the offer?

I look forward to your responses.

Thanks"

Normally, I'd be extremely happy with that pay as I'm still living at home with my parents and still in college, but I'm moving out this fall and will have to pay for my own food, transportation, and housing. 

So, specifically, my questions are: 

1. How can I make the jump from $12/hour to $15/hour, to eventually even over $20/hour? 

2. Would it be better for me to specialize (dig in deep on something like Android  and Java), or to spread my skills out (Learn Python, Javascript, PHP, SQL, C#/C++, etc.)? I'm currently trying to learn new skills and do side-projects to showcase those skills for my resume and GitHub. 

3. Should I try to get an offer from another company for this fall and then see if my existing employer will counter? I think my existing employer would like to see me stay on part time when school starts this fall, but I don't want to stay on for only $12. **How can I best increase my chances of getting another job offer this Fall for &gt;= $15/ hour?**

4. **Would it be better for me to work part time (25-30 hrs / week) and do school part time (6-8 credits) rather than just doing school full-time in order to increase my pay the fastest? Which choice would benefit my career the most?** I could graduate in 2 years if I did school full-time, but I don't think I could be working at the same time or doing side projects. 

Thanks in advance! Any input is appreciated.

I am currently a young professional who has a BS in Geology with a minor in GIS/Spatial Analysis. I am working toward my MS in GIS.

In my current job for an environmental firm, I manage the entire GIS system, do all of the spatial analysis, and produce nearly all of our maps, but I don't have any one above me to learn from. I also do regular field work and reports as part of the geology side of things

My question is, does this job lend to better experience and a higher possibility of becoming a GIS manager way down the line? Or am I missing out on having people above me to learn from?

Some more tidbits of information: I implemented the desktop software and maintain that, we don't have server. I have used ModelBuilder to streamline several workflows and I know the basics of Python and Java. I graduated last May (2016) but had two years of intern experience before that with the same company.

Would you stick out the current job for experience of look for a job that's explicitly in GIS, where I'll have GIS superiors?"

I have 1.5 years experience performing odd jobs/menial labor in various cities across the US (Bouncer, life guard, some part time phone service work).

I am rapidly approaching 30 and it is time to 'settle down' and 'grow up', and the only skill I have which I can actually make money with is programming. In my years working at several (very 'modern', free lunches, no dress code etc.) companies I just cannot fucking do it.

I hate programming with a passion. I still do it as a hobby sometime, making some mediocre android apps and am a somewhat regular contributor to a project on github, but I just cannot do it as a profession.

I hate the scrums, I hate sitting in an office for 40 hours a week, I fucking hate all of it, but I feel like I am stuck in this life and I don't know how to get out. I would be a happy man if I could shovel shit for the rest of my life for programmer pay, literally anything but staring at a computer screen in an office.

When I'm 50 and still working I don't want to bust ass like I'm 20, I want to be the guy behind a desk bringing in decent money and not performing any quantifiable amount of work while taking clients or my peers out to lunches/dinners/etc. I don't want to discuss PR's or do any of this shit.

It is certainly an excellent opportunity to experience a great number of focuses in the field. If I identify something in particular that could benefit us or others in the business I am encouraged to explore it.

   Now having said this - It is currently impossible to fully avoid the elevated Helpdesk roles and menial Desktop Support due to manpower limitations and expectations of others in the business.. (read - inexperienced co workers below me requiring time for assistance and/or saving but hey thats fine. Everyone needs to start somewhere.) 

  **For a bit of background on myself**: I graduated a few years ago with a degree in Poli Sci and internship experiences in a major cities court system from a very competitive private university. I ultimately decided the legal route was no longer something that interested me. Opting instead to explore IT and being fortunate to have been brought into this role. This is likely due to my customer service experience through college and tinkering experience in custom PCs.

   **My issue**: I am looking to move beyond these roles and identify what opportunities in the field could lay before me. I am looking to better utilize my social/interpersonal skills, organizational skills, excitement about the field, ability to collaborate and success with discussing technical subjects with the layman all while hopefully leveraging my technical skills and experience. 

**So folks of ITCareerQuestions**: Who has has success with identifying such a role in the past? Who finds themselves currently in a role allowing for this? Lastly, who has any idea what I could look to pursue, what I could research etc. Thank you immensely for taking the time to even read this far!"

For quite some time after I finished my finals I did a lot of research about building my own computer and all of its components. I found it fascinating how everything is made and how it functions. I understand that this barely scratches the surface of Electrical and Computer Engineering but this one particular area really interests me and there may be other areas of EE or ECE as well. I also have a senior design project coming up soon that is going to have us use microcontrollers, motors, Raspberry Pi, as well as, develop algorithms.

I'm not too fond the idea of going into academics because, although I do enjoy it, it's very stressful, competitive and I will be living off of peanuts for quite a few years to come.

The files are DBF (DBase File) types, and I want to open them in Microsoft Excel 2016. When I open a DBF with excel, random symbols appear instead of Chinese characters.

I have tried changing the language (file -&gt; options -&gt; language -&gt; editing language) to ""Chinese (PRC)"" and ""Chinese (Taiwan)"", but neither makes a difference. 

Because these are DBF and not CSV files, I also am unable to do the other common trick I see online (data -&gt; get external data -&gt; from text -&gt; open csv file -&gt; delimited -&gt; UTF8). 

Does anyone know how I can make the Chinese symbols appear? If possible I would really like a way to convert the symbols to Chinese without have to go back to opening the original DBF!"

I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my schedule.,yrtop,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/6d07bz/new_student_starting_this_summer_i_would_greatly/,"So I am beginning the program full time starting this summer. I don't have any significant prior experience and I definitely need to brush up on my math before the quarter starts but I am eager to get started. 

I will not be working and do not have any major outside commitments so I am able to devote a lot of time into classes and supplemental learning/projects outside of class. I would also plan on pursuing an internship, most likely in the summer of 2018. 

After reading through a lot of feedback on this sub, I feel like this 1.25 year track might be pretty balanced in terms of mixing easier classes with tougher ones. Please let me know what you think!

6d0e4z,9,2017-05-24,30M Australia ---&gt; Bulgaria or Hungary or Czech Republic,sqzr2,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/6d0e4z/30m_australia_bulgaria_or_hungary_or_czech/,"Hi guys

I want to move to Sophia Bulgaria, Budapest Hungary or Prague Czech Republic. _My plans are to continue my solo learning of computer vision to become a computer vision software contractor._ Hopefully after 6 or so months I can get contract/freelance work developing CV software solutions for companies across Europe as a remote contractor. I would base myself in one of these countries because I like the people and culture but also because they are relatively cheaper to live compared to Australia and Western Europe.

#### About me:

* Australian, 30yo, Male, currently in Sydney Australia.  
* No university degree. I did do 1 year of a Bachelor of Computer Science but moved into the workforce after that as a software developer intern. Been working as a software developer for 7 years.  
* Can only speak english. I have savings from selling my apartment of ~$AUD100k.  
* I have lived in Prague CZ for 2 months before and loved it so I sortof know what to expect if I were to go to CZ but I didn't have to deal with getting a business license and etc. which could/would make things harder. I haven't been to Bulgaria or Hungary.

---

Can you please give me advice on my plans below (anything I should do differently?) and answer my questions?

#### Work Plans:   

My plans are to learn computer vision solo/online and live off my savings. I really need to work remotely due to my social anxiety and temperament. So whilst I would love to get employed locally doing IT work my bespoke needs to work remotely (aswell as not being a local citizen) will most likely disqualify me from many jobs - it's alot to ask of a local employer. 
I would try to get a part-time remote job doing system admin or programming from online job sites. But that will mean I am not locally employed. 

&gt; * Is it possible to live long-term in CZ, HU or BU long-term without being locally employed?   
&gt; * How hard is it to get a business license in CZ, HU or BU. I know alot of government agencies will only communicate in the local language so that will be one hard area.    
&gt; * What happens if I cant find online work and I have a business licence? Will I be up for lots of tax to pay at the end of the year?    

#### Accommodation Plans:

For the first 1/2 months I plan to rent a small apartment through Airbnb (hopefully I can negotiate down a bit if I book for a whole month or more). Then eventually somehow try to rent an apartment through a real-estate agent paying the local rent fees. Not sure how though? 

&gt; * Can non-citizens rent property in CZ, HU, BU?    
&gt; * How hard is it to setup utilities (Internet, water electricity)? Do I need to speak the local language or can I communicate in english with the utility companies?   

Are there big issues I've forgotten that I should plan for? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

I'm a CC transfer student from LA. I'll be coming up to UC Davis in Fall 2017, or Summer Session II if I'm lucky..

Because I didn't have a chance to stay long at Transfer Day, I'd really like to get a chance to speak with someone who is a Pre-Law/Political Science major, or anyone who can help out.. I have a lot of questions but any help is greatly appreciated :)

1. What are internship/job opportunities like in Sacramento? If I have a resume with past experience (congressional internship, campaign staff etc.) is it possible to find off-campus work as an undergrad student

2. Are paralegal courses/certificate programs offered at UCD? 

3. Generally speaking, how is the POSC department at UCD? What can I expect from upper div classes as a POSC major? 

4. Are there any programs to consider/recommend pursuing as a minor/double major? 

5. As someone seriously considering law school, how is the UCD Grad School for Law? 

Any advice/insight would be amazing 
Thank you!! 🙂

6d0s38,22,2017-05-24,Power Corrupts,mytheosholt,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6d0s38/power_corrupts/,"I’ve debated whether or not to tell this story for a while. For one thing, it’s unlikely I’ll be believed. For another, it might get me into trouble finding a job down the road in politics, at least in DC. For those of you who don’t know, DC is basically a small town disguised as a city when it comes to its political community, and all the prime movers know each other. But considering what I discovered, maybe it’s for the best if I find another line of work. Actually, considering what I know, I think most people would probably think even the drug trade was safer.

You know what? Let me start at the beginning. Hi, my name’s Ben. It’s not my real name, but with what I’m about to relate, I don’t want people figuring out too much. As to what happened to me, well, it all starts with me getting hired to work as an intern on Capitol Hill with one of my home state Senators. I won’t say much more about which Senator that is – I won’t tell you their party affiliation, for example, because it’s not at all relevant and would probably turn this whole thing into a flame war needlessly. All I’ll say is that this was a male Senator (I need to admit that to use the right pronouns) who’d already won multiple elections in his home state (that’s relevant for the wider story). 

Now, there’s a couple things you should know about being an intern on Capitol Hill. For one thing, you are basically treated as the scum sticking to your supervisor’s boots. Seriously, no one in Washington wants you around except to occasionally grab them coffee, or make copies of some memo, or take notes at a hearing that they don’t want to bother attending. It’s drudgery designed for people who are supposed to be treated as expendable. 

I’ll admit, I didn’t take too well to the whole culture. Unlike a lot of the rich daddy’s girls and guys who get internships by exploiting political favors, I actually had a decent academic record and even some local campaign experience and I didn’t like being treated like I was the stupidest and least important person in the room constantly. But, of course, I didn’t want to get fired, so I didn’t openly complain. I just found little ways to do the absolute least I could as a way to get back at my superiors. Things like “forgetting” the dress code on some days, or showing up slightly drunk ever couple weeks. Little stuff, but the kind of thing I knew would get under their skin. In retrospect, I would be surprised they didn’t fire me, if not for what happened next.

I should mention a couple things about the office I worked in. Normally, those of us who were interns reported to whoever needed something done and couldn’t be bothered to do it themselves, but officially we reported to the Chief of Staff. Let’s just call him Rob, which isn’t his real name either, but again, anonymity matters here. 

Besides me, there were two other interns in the office: one, a completely insufferable loudmouth named Steve who kept mentioning how the Senator and his dad used to go to the same church, as if it somehow made him better than the rest of us. The other was a sweet, quiet, and totally gorgeous blonde girl named Vivian who I desperately wanted to bang, but also didn’t really know *how* to ask out, because she was even more awkward than I was. I’d guess she probably was one of those late bloomers who’d been the unpopular outcast in high school and most of college, and really hadn’t noticed she was pretty yet. We did become friends, and I once asked her to go get drunk with me at McFadden’s Bar in Foggy Bottom, but I don’t think she understood that I was asking her out, and just demurred because she didn’t have a fake ID and didn’t feel comfortable getting one. Like I said, she didn’t really get the whole being social thing.

Anyway, I mention these facts because they’re about to get very important. One day, when I just so happened to once again “forget” the dress code, and show up in flip flops, I got a summons from Rob, the Chief of Staff. Suddenly nervous that I might have pushed it too far and I was going to be fired, I went to his office. But that isn’t what happened. Instead, when I walked in, Rob looked up from his desk and, oddly, smiled.

“Nice work clothes,” he grunted, raising his eyebrows at me. I swallowed.

“Sorry, sir, I guess I forgot—“

“Oh, relax,” he snorted. “I get interns who dress like idiots every so often. It’s not the end of the world. And anyway, I don’t have time to hear your excuses. I have a job for you, but you’ve gotta keep it close to the chest. Got it?”

This surprised me. I didn’t know why I, of all people, would be the first intern he’d go to with some kind of sensitive project. I hadn’t exactly endeared myself to the rest of the staff. But, hey, if he wanted me to do something important, I wasn’t going to say no. This was what I wanted to be doing all along, after all. So I gave him my best attentive, dutiful expression and nodded.

“Yes, sir, of course. What do you need me to do?”

“You’ve been down to the tunnels by now, right?” he asked.

Oh yeah, I should explain something else. If any of you have ever been to Washington and visited Capitol Hill, you may wonder why you don’t see, say, Elizabeth Warren or Ted Cruz or a bunch of other legislators walking around outside the office buildings and the Capitol itself. Well, the answer is that there are actually tunnels that connect all the House and Senate office buildings both with each other and with the Capitol, and that’s how all those famous folks get back and forth between meetings, and so on. I’m sure there’s a thinkpiece to be written about how DC elites will do anything to avoid interacting with normal people, but just now, I don’t think you need my opinion about the tunnels. You just need to know they exist. Anyway, back to the story.

I nodded in response to Rob’s question. “Yes, sir, I’ve been to the tunnels.”

“And would you say you know the landmarks pretty well?”

I shrugged. “I guess.”

That must’ve been enough, because he fiddled in his desk and pulled out a grimy looking key.

“Well, I hope you do, because you might need it for this project. I need you to take the Senate tram from Hart to Dirksen—” 

These were Senate office buildings.

 “--and then, once you’re just outside the doors that head into Dirksen, look to the left. There’s a spot on the wall that’s covered up with tape. Pull that tape off and put this key in the hole you find. There’s a secret door down there to a storage room where all the Senate members keep some old files and memorabilia. If you could spend the next few hours just cataloguing all the files that are in our boss’s drawer, that’d be great. When you’ve finished you can have the rest of the day off, but I want it done by close of business today. Understand?”

I nodded. Ordinarily, the thought of cataloguing some old files in some dusty, hidden room would’ve felt like another boring, useless task, but the fact that these were kept in a hidden room in the basement of the Capitol was extremely intriguing. If nothing else, I’d have a story I could tell once this was all over. I assured Rob that I wouldn’t let him down, and without further ado, I took the elevator down to the basement and practically ran to the Senate tram. Fortunately, it runs very regularly, but I was excited, so the wait felt far longer than it probably actually was.

When I finally got off the tram and reached the entrance to the Dirksen office building, I immediately looked around for the tape on the wall. At first, I didn’t see anything, but as I scanned the wall more closely and pulled out the key in anticipation of finding it, my eye suddenly caught a stray piece of white masking tape that would’ve been indistinguishable from the wall if I hadn’t been looking extra hard for it. I’m sure that all the people walking past me wondered what I was doing when I started to scrape it away, but somehow no one stopped me or asked me what I was doing, even after I’d pulled it aside, pushed the key in, and felt the hidden door give way under my hands. In retrospect, this should’ve been my first warning sign that something weird was happening.

Once I’d found a light switch inside the room and flicked it on, though, the real surprise came. I’d expected a dreary, boring, white storage area with nothing but file cabinets, but instead, the room I’d walked into looked like it was a full-scale office: the kind I would’ve expected the Senator I worked for to use, if not for being underground and completely sealed off. The walls were mahogany, and a few comfortable leather seats sat in the center of the room, with a large but somehow tasteful looking file cabinet pushed up against the far wall. I also saw that this wasn’t the only door into the room – another one entered from the wall just to the right of where I’d entered. 

I figured I’d check that out later, though, because right at that moment, something else had drawn my attention: the pictures. On almost every inch of the mahogany walls, there were pictures hanging: pictures of politicians campaigning that must’ve gone back not just decades, but centuries. In fact, some of them weren’t even photographs, but paintings. One ancient-looking painting that I could swear I’d never seen before even showed Andrew Jackson, apparently shaking hands with an officer outside a Colonial-era house. 

My mission to catalogue files momentarily forgotten, I started walking around the room looking at the pictures. It was astounding: there were pictures of every President going back to Jackson himself in this room, usually campaigning or interacting with someone. Not only that, but there were hundreds of pictures of US Senators, some of whom I recognized from history books: Henry Clay, Preston Brooks, Robert Taft, Joe McCarthy, Ted Kennedy, and hundreds of others, including even several of my own boss! What was this office, and more importantly, who used it?

As a political geek, my head was spinning with excitement, and I started going over the pictures again, just to be sure I was really seeing as much history as I thought. It was during this second go-through that I noticed something else the pictures had in common besides depicting politicians, and which made me vaguely uneasy even without suspecting that anything was wrong. 

I first noticed it when I looked at the previously unseen portrait of Andrew Jackson and realized something: while Jackson was depicted with almost loving detail, the officer he was shaking hands with apparently hadn’t merited any concern from the artist at all, at least when it came to his face. The buttons on the uniform and the tricorn hat had been finished just as carefully as Jackson himself, but the shadow from the hat seemed to obscure all but the most vague outlines of the man’s face. At the time, I brushed it off. Maybe Jackson simply hadn’t wanted any face but his own to be noticeable.

But then I looked at the other pictures and realized that in every single one of them, there was a similar figure. In a picture of President Trump at a campaign rally, there was a guy standing off to the side in a MAGA hat, his face obscured by the brim. In a rally for President Obama, there was a similar figure, this time in a hoodie, again standing just off to the side. And so on, throughout the Presidents: there was a guy at a Nixon rally also in a baseball cap, there in a photograph of Woodrow Wilson wearing a wide brimmed bowler, there in a painting of Abraham Lincoln addressing soldiers, again in uniform, with his hat obscuring his face. I had no idea that something supernatural might have been going on at the time, so the idea that it might’ve been the same person never occurred to me, but I was still creeped out for a reason I couldn’t fully identify at the time. If I had to guess, I’d say that as I looked at all those pictures, I almost felt like I was somehow being watched and studied, despite being the only person in that room.

It was at this point that I went to the filing cabinet and decided I wanted to get my job done as quickly as possible, just to get out of that room. The thing was absolutely stuffed with files when I opened it, but after a lot of ruffling through papers, I finally found the file with my boss’s name on it. When I pulled it out and opened it, I was stunned to find only a single document bearing a simple title: “NOT RETAINED.” A very short list of typewritten names followed, with the last number left blank. 

Now it all made sense. This was a warning. Here I was, surrounded by all these pictures of history happening, and was being asked to look at a list of people who’d been fired from their jobs. Hell, even the guy in all the pictures with his face blocked made sense in that light. I was being warned by my bosses – toe the line and maybe you can be a historic figure, or stay being a fuck-up and you will be someone so forgotten that you’ll never see their face. It was a clever little trick and I had to admire what was probably a very clever use of Photoshop and amateur painting to set the office up. And frankly, while it stung a little that the folks in my office had apparently thought I was a bad enough intern to warrant such a warning, it also was kind of a relief that they cared enough to give me this kind of an elaborate warning rather than just firing me. Maybe they thought I had potential after all?

I jotted down the name of the single file on my notepad, as well as the names on it, then shut it back in the filing cabinet, and stood up to go. I decided to leave by the unopened second door, just to see where it came out, but when I opened it, I found myself somewhat bewildered as the doorway was completely blocked off by a brick wall. 

*Why put another door in the office if you can’t use it,* I wondered, as I pulled open the door through which I’d entered. Then, I left the mysterious office in the tunnels, heading back to the Senate tram. 

When I got back to the Senator’s office, I knocked on Rob’s door almost immediately. 

“Yes?” I heard his voice come roughly through the door.

I cleared my throat. “It’s me, Ben, sir. I’m here with that list you wanted.”

A short silence followed. “*Ben?*” came the reply. “Ben the intern?”

I was confused. Were there other Bens in the office. “Er…yes, sir, that’s me. Like I said, I have that list you wanted.”

Another pause. Then… 

“Come on in, Ben.”

I pushed the door open and walked in, feeling a little sheepish. But that feeling vanished as soon as I saw Rob’s face. He was staring up at me with an expression that’s really hard to describe, but I’ll try. If I had to guess, I’d say it was somewhere between shock, incredulity, and extreme guardedness. He must’ve realized how weird he looked because as soon as the door clicked shut behind me, the expression vanished, only to be replaced with a conspicuously insincere, oily smile.

“Ben!” he said warmly, as if I were some long lost best friend. “Come on in. That was fast. I’m impressed.”

Not knowing what else to do, I smiled, the sheepishness once more returning. “Yes, sir. It…well, I got the message. Here’s that ‘list’ you wanted.”

I handed him the very short “list” of the single file and its names. His eyes crisscrossed the paper for a few seconds, visibly widening in shock, before he put it down and gave me another oily smile.

“Go home, Ben,” he said. “I said you could take the day off and I meant it. Go home. And do an old man a favor and dress right tomorrow?”

He winked at me as he said this. I was still unbelievably confused, but I wasn’t going to pass up a chance at a day off. So, I thanked him and went back to the office to collect my things. As I arrived, I suddenly felt something gently brush against the inside of my shirt pocket and realized I’d forgotten to give Rob back the key. In retrospect, I should’ve rushed back to his office and handed it to him like it was red hot. But, fool that I was, I didn’t.

Instead, I walked right over to the tiny little desk where Vivian was licking envelopes. The way I saw it, I had the key to possibly the greatest makeout spot in the Capitol, and I had an ironclad excuse to take her there under the guise of its being secret. So, once she’d finished with the envelopes, I tapped her on the shoulder and grinned at her with what I thought was roguish charm.

“Hey Viv.”

She looked up at me with a sort of deer-in-the-headlights cluelessness that made her seem twice as adorable.

“Yes, Ben? Do you need something?”

I shrugged. “I actually have the rest of the day off, and was wondering if I could show you something quickly. That is, if you don’t have anything else to do.”

Her face clouded over. “I really don’t think I should leave the office, Ben. Someone might have something they need me to do. What is it?”

I decided I need to sell the idea hard. “What is it?” I repeated incredulously. “Only the greatest hidden treasure trove of political history I’ve ever seen! Seriously, it’s awesome. Rob sent me to go down to this secret room just near the tram. There’s pictures of every politician you’ve ever heard of down there, and some of them I don’t think anyone’s ever seen. Rob didn’t ask for the key back yet, but I figure he’ll want it back soon, so we really should hurry. Come on. It won’t take more than…fifteen minutes.” 

Vivian got a nervous look on her face, but I could see that the enticement of seeing a secret room full of political trivia excited her. She looked around furtively, then stood up.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “But no more than fifteen minutes…right?”

“Of course,” I said, not even needing fifteen seconds to think about it.

From there, we practically ran to the elevator, then back to the tram, and finally to the wall. This time, it took me far shorter to locate the strip of masking tape, and in close to no time, we’d unlocked the door and gone back into the room. And believe me when I say that I wish more than anything else that the rest of this story involved nothing more than us making out in some crappy old basement office that no one used anymore. Hell, I’d rather I’d gone nuts and imagined that instead. But I’m sane, and I’ll never forget what happened. So I’ll have to type it out here.

As soon as Vivian and I walked into that big, hidden office, the door slammed shut behind us as if a gust of wind had blown it shut. Unnerved, I reached out and pulled on the handle, only to find that the door had not only blown shut, but somehow locked itself, too. I was certain it hadn’t done this before, so I pulled out the key and started fiddling uselessly with the door.

Then I heard a strangled shriek from Vivian and – to my confusion and increasing terror – the sound of hinges creaking nearby.

I turned around and saw that the other door, the one that I was sure had led to a wall, was slowly opening and somehow, someone had walked out of it. But it wasn’t just any someone. Oh sure, from the neck down, it looked like a normal staffer who’d just wandered into the wrong room. But from the neck up—God.

The thing had a head that was not only completely bald, but seemed to glow in the bright fluorescent light, as if it were covered in slime. The outline of the head was human, but as it turned to face us, I saw that where its face was, there was nothing but another smooth, slimy surface covered in crawling appendages that looked like maggots. Well, except for the mouth. That was large, round, and lined with infinite rows of needle sharp teeth: like the ugly child of a meat grinder and a snake’s gullet. 

I can’t tell you how long I stood staring at that hideous nightmare as it approached us. Or rather, as it approached Vivian, who was somehow so transfixed with horror that she could barely even scream. Instead, nothing but strangled gasping squeaks seemed to come from her throat as the Thing drew closer, until finally, her voice seemed to gain its strength back and she loosed a horrified scream that belonged to the deepest pits of Hell and that I am sure I will hear in my dreams for as long as I live.

At that sound, the creature lunged forward, seizing Vivian by the wrists and pinning her to the wall. That simple action broke my paralysis and, yelling, I lunged at it, trying to push it off her. It shoved me away, though, and its strength was so terrible that I didn’t so much fall away as flop against the wall like a rag doll, my head cracking against the concrete with horrible dizzying pain. 

The Thing, apparently satisfied that I was incapacitated, returned to ignoring me and turned its attention back to Vivian. It regarded her terrified, wailing form for just a few seconds before its patience was apparently exhausted and it slammed its face against hers in some horrible parody of a kiss. Her screams grew louder for a few terrible moments and then plunged into an even more terrible silence. When the thing drew back after just a single terrible minute, the entire lower half of her head, and her neck, had been chewed through, exposing only the skull and spine above the gushing hole in her torso. 

I was sure the Thing would come for me next. I tried to push myself upward from the floor, but it was useless. I was too dizzy from the fall to move. I still tried to scream, though. Maybe someone would hear me through the wall. Maybe someone who knew this room was here. Oh God, please…

But even as the creature turned toward me and I felt that hideous, hateful, visionless gaze on my skin, it did not move to attack me. Instead, it simply regarded me for a few seconds before raising one human-looking hand to its heart, like some monstrous politician saluting the flag. Then, the teeth in its gaping maw retracted and I heard a hoarse, death rattle-like whistle emerge from its throat as it turned to the filing cabinet and pulled it open. From the depths of one file, it pulled a single piece of paper and showed it to me. At the top ran the words “NOT RETAINED,” and at the bottom of the list of names, where there had been only a blank space before, Vivian’s name now sat. Then, once it was confident I understood, it replaced the file, turned away from me and walked back to the door that I had thought went nowhere. It was still whistling as it closed the door behind it, and as the lock clicked, my very dizzy mind registered the tune: *Hail to the Chief.*

Needless to say, when I finally got enough coordination to get out of that room, I ran. I tried to grab one of the Capitol Hill police and tell him something was wrong, that someone had been killed. But after going back to the wall where the masking tape had been and finding that there was suddenly no mysterious keyhole behind it, he advised me to “see someone about that head” and walked away. I quit my internship the next day when Vivian never showed up, which told me pretty clearly that what I’d witnessed was no nightmare. 

Rob didn’t seem surprised when I quit. And why would he? I’m not an idiot, and I’ve figured out what was *supposed* to happen: the Thing was supposed to eat me. That’s why he’d sent me down to that room – not as a warning to me, as an offering to It, because he figured a single pushy intern’s disappearance could be brushed off without incident. That’s why they didn’t fire me. Because I was meant to be food, but I wasn’t. He did say something to me when I handed in my badge that chills me to this day, though, and which explains why I’m still considering going back into politics at all.

Even so, you probably wonder why they do this to begin with. Well, after a lot of thinking, I believe I understand: All the politicians pictured in that terrible extradimensional office had one thing in common: They all won their elections. Not only that, but there were only as many names on that list of “NOT RETAINED” people as there were terms that my boss had served in the Senate. What’s more, and I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into it by saying this, but since this is all I can think about these days, I have to say it: even looking back on the Thing’s murder of Vivian, it’s obvious that it only ate enough of her to get at two body parts: her tongue and vocal chords. In other words, it ate her voice, most likely so that my boss could keep his for another term. Because that’s what sacrificing peoples’ voices to it must do: it makes sure that the person who does the sacrifice wins their next election. I don’t know what happens when two people do it at once, and frankly, I don’t want to know, but I’m almost certain that this is why the creature has an “office” in the Capitol. Incumbent's advantage is a bitch.

Which brings me to the last thing Rob said to me. When I’d done informing him that I was leaving, he shrugged but gave me another one of those horribly insincere smiles. And then he did something I didn’t expect: He pulled out his business card and handed it to me.

“Pity,” he said. “You’ve got a lot of potential. Matter of fact, if you ever run for office, call me. I got the feeling you got at least one friend in the right place.”

And this is why I have kept the identities involved secret. Because even if Rob thought I would be food, the Thing spared me. It can only have done that because it expected I would have a bright political future: one in which it might be required to intervene. One that might force me to feed it down the road, as I unwittingly did with Vivian.

And I might just prove it right. Because now I know that if I get into the Senate, someone’s going to give my Chief of Staff a key. A key to a room that only exists when someone who has business with what’s inside is looking for it. And while the Thing has excellent taste in decorating, what with all its business with previous leaders, it made one big mistake. 

It kept records that could be copied down. And if I’m ever a Senator, I will be sure to copy all those records, and uncover all those names of mysteriously missing victims. I’ll blow the whole thing wide open, which I can’t do now, but maybe as a Senator, I can. 

I’m doing it for Vivian, after all, and to make sure it never happens to anyone else again.

Hey, I'm an undergraduate student from Brazil (relax, I can speak proper English haha) facing some issues atm. I would like to see you guys share some personal experiences, feedback, thoughts and etc. :)

First of all, I'm studying at Law school for 4 years. It hasn't been easy. I can't relate to it since day one, even though I was seeing a therapist before making this decision. We talked a lot about it, and lots of vocational tests were involved in the process as well. Anyways, I'm not happy nor at least content. During these years I've failed several subjects, and it's really frustrating. I don't have the motivation to sit down and study, let's say, Constitutional Law for more than half an hour. On a side note, I was feeling depressed during high school and my first year in college (I'm doing fine now), because I used to be obese and lacked energy confidence and so on. 

At the present moment, I'm looking way better, no longer taking meds. The thing is: my dad pays the monthly tuition, and he doesn't want me to drop Law School (he's a lawyer). I live with him since 6 months ago (I used to live with my mom).

So, the issues are:

1) I am depending on him to eat and have a place to stay

2) It feels like I'm wasting my time doing something I have no interest in

3) IDK what would make me happy and motivated to study and work with

4) I don't feel like living here for the rest of my life. The country is a mess right now and I can't get along with my dad's family. I would LOVE to start over in overseas (I went on a trip a few times, anywhere seemed better than here).

5) I'm working 3 days a week as an internship but I don't make much money :/

My background story is huge, so I tried to stick with the main points here. I can provide more info!

Also I'm not expecting any miraculous solution, but any tip is more than welcome. I've been reading a lot about self improvement.

Ty in advance :)"
6d2qsd,3,2017-05-24,The Munuk Grin,nocheesybusiness,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6d2qsd/the_munuk_grin/,"Last April my brother left for Doctoral geological fieldwork in eastern Russia. He was looking for copper deposits for a Moscow mining consortium near Ayan. We’ve always had our differences; I was always the practical sister and he, he was the boy with his head in the clouds. We fought sometimes, especially when dad died and he couldn’t make the funeral. But he landed an internship trip and promised soon he’d be making money once his paper was published. I drove him to the airport and fourteen hours later he touched down. He was to be working there for at least six months and we agreed only to skype when he had the time. I didn’t mind. I had a daughter and full time job at the hospital. My brother had his papers and his rocks.

The first time we talked was May 2nd. He was in a room with white walls and white blinds, the lighting bleached everything with clinical brightness. His desk was a mess of papers and dry coffee stains. He said it felt like September there and that he was making significant progress, though I could see he was sleeping little and guessed it was the corporate bigshots and their quarterly targets. He may have been a little skittish but I put it down to lack of sleep and the Russian cold. 

On May 27th we spoke only a short while: he said they had found promising sulphide deposits at a grid reference I never remembered. I told him his niece had started primary school. The bags under his eyes were heavier, and every time there came a yawn, he apologised, said he was tired. I tried calling but we didn’t speak until June 15th.

June 15th was a Wednesday. We talked when Emily, my daughter, was in bed, at around nine-thirty. I saw the same room and my brother, but he didn’t look tired anymore, instead he looked mildly amused, which was strange because it had been a long time since my brother and I had laughed or joked together. I asked him what was the matter but he just looked straight at me with same expression and said he was down. The corporate bigshots had lost confidence in the site and the internship was about to be closed. His tone of voice was low and melancholic but his eyes stared and his head tilted to the right. He still looked amused and I felt something was seriously wrong. It seemed plausible to me that he was truly depressed and, for some reason, hiding it behind a grin.

‘Cathy…I really thought this was it.’ I remember him saying that. His face fell into his hands and he sobbed, but the amused expression remained and I began to wonder how it was possible, physically, to audibly sob whilst also smiling.

He moved his hands away.

For a moment I thought I saw something I couldn’t have possibly seen. Deep, deep within his eyes.

He turned to the screen and the face of my brother seemed to match his composure again. The smile was gone.

That night I stayed up with him, and when we parted I felt for the first time like he was truly helpless. I had always been there for him, but now a Skype call couldn’t bridge the thousands of kilometres between my brother and help. That week I called him every day but he never answered and it just rang out. It was June 23rd and I was about to fly to find him when, whilst on the night duty on the wards, I managed to get through to him on the office desktop.

The picture was almost entirely black and pixelated. I had headphones in and forgot to turn the sound down, so the humming of the ventilation system was all that could be heard and nothing else, that and heavy breathing. A shivering intake of breath, sharp and fast. Exhales: unusually long and quivering.

I kept calling for him whilst searching in the shifting pixels.

‘Did you see it?’ It was a demand and a question.

‘John? John? Where are you? You’re scaring me.’

‘Did you see it?’ I startled when he spat out the last word viciously, nearly pulling the headphones from the socket.

‘Did you see it…the munuk…munukas…munakum.’ He began croaking and repeated these words in broken utterances. After a few moments I thought I heard dripping water, like a leaking drain pipe, in the background. There were other sounds but I couldn’t discern their makers.

‘John, where are you? What’s the local emergency number?’ He began wailing, like Emily when I forced to her school. ‘Why didn’t you say! Why didn’t you say!'

‘John, what’s the local emergency number?’

‘You should have…’ A crescendo. ‘Said!’ He barked and I startled again, the headphones pulled out and the computer immediately muted. I admit I nearly did not plug them back in.

‘John, I’m going to get you help, okay. I will call you back, promise me you’ll answer, please.’ The pixels shifted and the water was still running, the ventilation still humming. I could make out a lighter patch, dull white. Maybe it was an eye or a few teeth.

‘-unuk…munukas…munukum…munuk…munukas…munukum…’ On and on he went until I hung up. ‘Munu-’.

I left immediately. I ran, it was a blur. Who would I call? The police? The embassy? The business my brother worked for? I had no idea. The panic set, as the stress had long before. The words were running though my mind because of the strange way he had uttered them, throaty and guttural: munuk, munukas, munukum.

I arrived home to catch Emily watching TV, long past her bedtime. I am not a perfect parent. I had to leave her home on nights, there was no other option, and she was usually well-behaved. I was stressed and panicked and desperately searching for the numbers and the contacts I could possibly need. I was screaming for her to get to bed. I don’t usually scream. 

She started crying and it made me more furious. I was screaming even more. She looked pathetic, her watery eyes and her slimy nose, wailing in a corner with fuzzy brown hair. The TV was still on; it was her favourite show.

Her last words were strange—she had said them days before: ‘Mummy stop smiling’."

I just graduated from high school. I've been working with a Bureau within the Department of the Interior for the past year doing basic help desk stuff / general intern things but I'm now getting bumped up to Desktop support. I can work for them the remainder of the summer but I have also been offered an internship with a defense contractor for this summer doing things like ""Web Development, cybersecurity, and maybe some Python/Java"" stuff (according to my interview with them). The defense contractor pays slightly more but the commute is significantly farther away (10-15 mins vs 45 mins) so my gas/vehicle costs make the pay between the two even. I'm interested in pursuing software development / machine learning / robotics in my career so I'm thinking right now that even with the increased commute time it's probably worth taking the job with the defense contractor as it's more in line with what I want to do and probably looks more ""prestigious"" on my resume. In addition it sounds like there's a chance I could take this internship to college with me as a part time job which I'm not too interested in (I'd rather focus on academics) but it's always a good option to have. In addition, I've talked to my recruiter about getting a slight pay bump so that I end up making more with the defense contractor but they seemed to ignore my concerns. Is it unheard of for interns to negotiate their offers?

Also, would having a security clearance have any benefits within the private industry? The defense contractor is offering to sponsor me for one but I'm not too big on government jobs so I'm hoping to get into the private industry with my next internship.

Thanks!

Edit: I realized I never really asked a clear, definite question but I was just wondering if my thinking makes sense (take the new internship because it's probably more in line with what I want and will possibly help me get better jobs later. Besides that I'm just wondering about the security clearance and if interns have any chance of negotiating their offer).

First night there I found dozens of roaches and a bedbug. Leasing company refuses to acknowledge bug infestation, wants me to forfeit deposit, first months rent, and sign NDA to get released from remainder of lease.


I'm currently a 21 year old with a summer internship in United States, N.C.  I needed a place to stay for the next two months so I found a person sub-letting their apartment on craigslist.  


Since I was from out of town I didn't get a chance to see the apartment beforehand. From the pictures it looked okay, and the previous tenant assured me that it was a nice place. The apartment was provided ""as is"" meaning it wouldn't be cleaned before I took over the lease.  


On Monday (May 22nd) I arrived and signed off on the lease agreement papers to move in. I paid a $250 security deposit, a $250 rent deposit, and $238 in pro-rated rent for the rest of May.  They gave me a checklist to take note of the condition of the apartment. I got the keys and went to check out my new apartment.


As soon as I stepped in I could tell the place was pretty nasty. Smelled like dog pee, whole floor was sticky, a couple roaches crawling around, black mold growing on the windows, and to top it off there was a 2 foot tall penis drawn on the bedroom wall...


I wasn't expecting luxury but this was a bit much so I walked back down to the leasing office and let them know the current condition the apartment was in.  When I got there and told them they seemed pretty concerned and sent a guy (lets call him Tommy) down there to check it out with me. 


Tommy agreed the place was in bad shape, took pictures, and then went back and reported it to the leasing office.  They decided to charge the previous tenant a $338 cleaning fee due to the state she left it in.  Meanwhile, they sent Tommy back to my apartment with a vacuum cleaner  and some lysol to help clean it up. 


Tommy vacuumed the floors and sprayed some lysol in the tub and that was it. I asked about the roaches and he replied that he only saw the two that I had originally saw (and killed) and he checked around the apartment and it was clean so I shouldn't worry.  


Tommy left and I went to Walmart to buy some more serious cleaning supplies. I came back and tried my best to clean the apartment the best I could. I mopped the floors, put carpet cleaning foam all throughout the bedroom, wiped down everything with cleaner. I figured I'd make the best of it.


*****  Heres where shit goes south. ******


I get some dinner and come back to the apartment and blow up my air mattress to go to bed. I turn out the lights and hop in.  I cant fall asleep so I turn on my phone flashlight and look across the carpet... roaches... everywhere. I counted about 7 crawling across the carpet.  Freaked out, I sat up and looked all the way around the room to see a small little bug crawling up to my pillow.  


I got out of bed, killed the roaches and the bug climbing on my sheets.  I thought the bug on my sheets was maybe a tick since the previous tenant had a dog. Google images quickly proved that it was a bed bug, an adult bed bug at that. 


I took videos and pictures and I got out of there as fast as possible. Thankfully, I hadn't taken anything really in the apartment so I grabbed and headed to a hotel at 1am.


The next day, I called the leasing office at work and told them I couldn't live there and the place was infested.  They said the place was provided as is and I already signed the lease so it was my problem. I went to the office after work and they had another woman there who explained that they had sent an exterminator to the apartment earlier that day who said they couldn't find any bugs.  I showed her the video I took and she just said ""I'm sorry"".  She then said that If I wanted to get out of my lease I could sign a document that looked like a poorly written NDA. 


The document said that I could be released from the remainder of my lease if



1. Tenant surrenders any future claims holding &lt;leasing company&gt; responsible for any damages (material, psychological, or health &amp; well being) resulting from the tenancy.


2. Tenant agrees not to publicly speak, blog, post, or communicate in any way opinions that may reflect upon &lt;leasing company&gt; in a derogatory sense.


3. Tenant agrees not to disclose the details of this agreement for One (1) Year to anyone who is not a legal representative or lease guarantor



In turn I would forfeit my initial payment of a total of $735.  
I didn't sign it and told them they need to refund me before I even think about signing some piece of crap like this. They refused and said I can go the legal route if I really want but they aren't budging. 


Currently writing this from a hotel room. I have no idea where to go from here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.


TLDR: Signed a lease for an apartment. First night there I found dozens of roaches and a bedbug. Leasing company refuses to acknowledge bug infestation, wants me to forfeit deposit, first months rent, and sign NDA to get released from remainder of lease."

So, I guess I'll get right into it.

I accepted an offer in February from a Fortune 100 company that doesn't pay very well to its computer science interns. I've already gone to the office and signed paper work for ""processing"" although I'm not completely sure what I actually signed. I'm supposed to be starting on the first of June. Just now, I got an offer from a very reputable software company that pays 10 dollars per hour more than the previous company. Neither company has yet to tell me EXACTLY what I'd be working on so that's why I'm comparing the wages. Also the name that pays 10 dollars more an hour is much more respected in the field of CS and would look better on my resume for future job prospects. Is it too late to renege? Is it even worth it to renege at this point for the extra benefits?

tldr: I want to renege a week before an internship starts in order to work at a better one.

Thanks in advance!"

I am really interested in programming, and not as enthusiastic about EE.

I have two side projects:

- A Chrome Extension using vanilla JavaScript. I made this without knowing any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript beforehand, so the code is probably reaaaaally shitty, but I made it work. This was also my first finished project, so I had no idea what I was doing in terms of tests and organization, etc.

- A 2D game in Unity that I've been making in C#. I've written a few thousand lines of code for it, but I don't think it uses any special or complicated C#. Waaay too big. I was too ambitious starting this, but it's just a passion project for me at this point.

I want internships, but I have no idea where to go from here. There is just so much stuff. I am panicking and thinking there is no way that I will ever be ready for a real job. I was just about to start a C#.NET Windows forms side project in Visual Studio because I like Visual Studio and want to learn the Windows API, but I started doubting myself. Is this a good idea at this point? I keep seeing and hearing that you can't get a job doing something you haven't done before, and that is really stressing me out. I'm really worried that side projects I do will take too long and not really prepare me for a real job. Sorry for being naive and rambling, it's 5 AM and I can't sleep. Everything is bugging me."
6d9vky,3,2017-05-25,Accepted a low paying job with promise for growth but was told to back off on training for the position I want.,syranlaut,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6d9vky/accepted_a_low_paying_job_with_promise_for_growth/,"I'm an IT major, about 7 classes from graduating. I've been a lot of majors in the past including political science, visual arts, and history, and almost have a minor in philosophy. I'd say I have a well rounded liberal arts education, but I've got loads of experience in lower level IT, I've been doing computer repair and remote stuff since I started college before realizing that I was investing my mental resources in learning more and more about tech than I was in being a lawyer or whatever else I thought I was going to be. I opened a computer repair business with two of my friends as well which made it about a year before complications led us to close. Anyway, due to general senior burnout and a merger which complicates my graduation, I decided to cut back on classes to take a job at an IT company. Initially, the job description was for an office assistant, but since I was unsuccessfully applying for internships I decided to take my chances anyway. The interview went great, boss man promised opportunities for growth. The position was basically as an intern making about $11 an hour, which was a huge paycut for me based on previous jobs/ owning a business, but I was excited.

Fast forward a couple of months and I am mostly content. Since we had the office administrator leave unexpectedly I've taken over most of his responsibilities out of necessity. I make mistakes since this is all new to me but I'm learning quickly, keeping a positive attitude, and taking Level I help desk/ web dev tickets when I've got extra time. I listen in on the technicians' conversations and learn a good bit from them as well. I start feeling like this job, even though I am making &lt;28k a year, is really adding valuable experience, but with my new responsibilities I'm becoming disgruntled with the pay.

The issue now is that they are hiring for a help desk technician, and I want that job. I understand there's a lot of training but I have the experience and education and soft skills to perform that job well, and I'm *adequately doing a job girls do out of high school. They are currently interviewing, and they are interviewing candidates with more experience than me, so I had just gotten to the point where I am reminding myself to be patient and keep learning but then yesterday happened.

After a meeting with one of my bosses he asked me what I had been doing to fit in and meet the needs of the company. I decided to use this as an opportunity to express how I've been helping out with help desk (it's understaffed so there's quite a bit of overflow) and attempting to streamline organization, vendor communication and some other things I've been working on picking up after the old administrator. 

My boss looks at me and says ""It's great that you're interested in tech but I believe your skills are better suited to administrative duties.""

I was taken aback. I did not spend ~45k on a degree to be an office girl. I have not fumigated cockroaches out of laptops, wiped questionable fluids off of computers, slaved over forums for coding projects with no sleep to do something most women do straight out of high school. 

I've only been here a few months, but I can see that the growth they're talking about here does not fall in line with my career goals. The experience I'm gaining is with data entry, purchasing, correspondence, and the back end of PSA.

Should I start looking for a new job? Should I talk to my bosses about my feelings? Should I wait a few months before taking action? The workplace culture and learning opportunities are great but the pay is shit and I don't want to stagnate, and if I don't get to do any IT work then what is even the point? 

I'm just frustrated and disappointed.

A week ago I was thinking if I should drop out of university due to my mental health, but decided not to and to finish my studies (I only have exams this year and the whole of next year left). However, now there's another question - what should I do throughout the summer? I was considering dropping out of  university because of my poor mental health condition - I'm quite depressed, unmotivated and overall unhappy (it's been better recently though at least). However, as I myself am not working during my studies, and my parents are paying for my rent here, it would only be fair if I dedicated my summer to work and earn at least a little bit of money. I applied for many, many internships but sadly didn't get a single one, so I would be working as a cashier or something of that sort. I am studying abroad so I would be pretty much completely alone during the holiday, apart from going to work. Over my life I have been completely by myself for a month twice (I stayed in my dorms throughout the winter holidays) and it was just horrific. My mental health got completely destroyed and I was in a very bad place at that time. Apart from being alone, I really hate the house I am currently at - it's an incredibly old house, it's full of mold, the bathroom looks like it's been used by druggies or something crazy like that (there's bugs and other crazy disgusting stuff in the bathroom too), and I would be living in this house alone, so that's also super scary as the house was robbed once in the past, so I guess this isn't the safest neighborhood to live in alone. 

If I could decide what to do during the summer without any external factors, I would dedicate my summer to rest - no work, no volunteering, just read book and work out, maybe improve a skill or two (I have recently taken up drawing). I think this would be great for my mental health as the last year of uni will be by far the hardest, and I'm not in a very good place right now, and working for 2-3 months could make me go completely crazy (I'm pretty sure I could get super depressed during those couple of months). However, I don't want to disappoint my parents and stuff, so it's a hard decision to make.

What do you think?

**TLDR**: I have poor mental health during my studies and my parents are paying for my rent so I should make it up for them by working during the summer. However, knowing my trends it's very possible I will become even more depressed. Not sure what to do"
6daa0k,0,2017-05-25,How much does internship field matter?,onohalppls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6daa0k/how_much_does_internship_field_matter/,"Hey guys,

I'm wondering how much the relevant field of a student's internship matters.

I've had (or will have this summer) two internships, both in finance (big bank hedge fund, small quant fund).  Thing is, I'm actually more interested in joining a tech sector software company rather than anything finance sector after college.  These just happen to be the internships I lucked into.

Will this be a concern?  Will recruiters for next summer's internship and post graduate job opportunities wonder why all of my experience is in the finance sector?

I'm a soon-to-be-junior at a top 3 CS university, if it matters.

Thanks."

* Graduated with a Math degree and basic programming skills (had academic and internship experience with MATLAB and R, knew how to write basic algorithms, read files, etc.)
* Decided to try applying for software engineering positions
* Easily got interviews at AMZN, MSFT, other ""top"" companies, but was completely unprepared and didn't pass them
* After months of applying for jobs and self-learning, was able to get a contract job that consisted of web grunt work a big-name company 
* Have now been working for 3.5 years as a .NET code monkey and have job hopped a couple times, seeking more advanced and higher-paying roles. The goal is still, of course, to get a position at a top company. I thought that MSFT would be eager to hire, or at least interview, me at this point.
* In my free time I do a lot of self-learning and practice. I am planning to call in sick tomorrow for work so I can do a 48-hr HackerRank competition.
* The only top company that has interviewed me a 2nd time is AMZN and I failed again. I have reapplied at almost every company and never heard back (I think this is because once you've been rejected your profile ends up in an auto-reject pile)
* One thing I've concluded is that I don't have a high enough IQ to be super good at algorithms. Interview questions like ""find the distance between 2 nodes in a binary tree"" will never seem like a cinch to me, no matter how much I practice, and I will stumble if I'm having a bad day. I compete in HackerRank competitions and consistently score in the 70th-85th percentile, to give you an idea of where my natural skill level is.
* I want to reiterate that the main problem I'm having is that I'm not getting interviews anymore.
* I'm also noticing that software engineering positions are requiring more and more. I'm falling behind the curve by not knowing machine learning, distributed systems, multiple modern JS libraries.

6damac,173,2017-05-25,The secret to having excellent letters of recommendation,novembrr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6damac/the_secret_to_having_excellent_letters_of/,"I've seen a lot of posts from students on r/ApplyingToCollege and a lot of emails from my own students asking who should they ask to write letters of recommendation. I read apps for a top 10 university, and my recommendation is to ask for two letters of recommendation, one from a teacher in a STEM field and one from a teacher in the humanities. Ideally, pick a junior year teacher. Other options include asking a senior year teacher who taught you in a previous grade or has worked with you in some extracurricular activity, or a sophomore year teacher with whom you have an ongoing relationship (you TAed one of their classes, you work with them in an extracurricular activity, etc.). If you've had a prestigious internship, ask your advisor/professor if they're amenable to writing a letter of recommendation on your behalf, in addition to the two recs from teachers. Some schools will allow you to send 3 recs and even if they don't, you could follow up with a LOCI and attach that 3rd rec.

**So what's the secret to having excellent letters of recommendation?**
Personalization! You cannot believe how many letters of rec I read that were blah, telling me nothing specific about the student, their personality, or their aspirations. Ideally, a teacher will also assess the student's ability compared to their peers (for example, ""He is the single most driven student I have met in my 10 year career, and he is absolutely determined to accomplish his dreams of XYZ"" or ""She is the brightest math student I teach across all my 7 classes this year,"" etc.). 

How do you get letters of recommendation like that? Give your teacher a letter/brag sheet/whatever you want to call it. Teachers have limited time to write your letter of rec; often, they will paraphrase or directly quote things you have written. This is an excellent opportunity for you to advance qualities that you think your dream universities would love to see within your application. Most students have control over everything in their application but letters of rec—with this exercise, you'll have some control over letters of rec, as well.

**Title your document something like:**
 
Helpful information for writing a letter of recommendation for [Name]
 
**In the body of your document, include the following sections (and answer them):**
 
 
**Name**
 
**Why I liked your class**
 
Things to keep in mind: Be very specific into why you liked that particular teacher's class. Mention projects you liked, describe what you found fascinating about the subject or what you liked about the teacher's teaching style, and say something about yourself in the process. You might also want to incorporate your desired major and how it relates to this particular class.
 
Example: I really loved AP Literature because I have always been mesmerized by far off lands in literature. More so than just being transported to a different world when reading [book 1] or [book 2], however, I loved being transported into different perspectives. Taking a step back from literature, in general I am mesmerized by people—how they think, why they act the way they do, what causes them to make certain decisions over others, and so on. That’s one of the reasons why I want to major in Sociology in college, for I crave as much knowledge about other people as possible. In AP Literature, I satiated my thirst for all things related to sociology when I read [book], which gave me a glimpse into the inner workings of [group of people]. What I found so curious about the book, from a sociological standpoint, was ________. It really made me reflect upon my own circumstances and realize [something about myself]. Additionally, I really appreciated how you asked probing questions during class, such as [question] or [question]. Breaking out into small discussion groups to ruminate on those questions really elucidated how much [something else about yourself or your perspective]. As such, I’m seeking a university where I can not only study Sociology but also the world’s greatest pieces of literature.
 
**What I learned about myself during high school**
 
Things to keep in mind: Be reflective about your transition from a freshman to a junior, both in an academic sense but also related to your personality, maturity, or preparation for college. What changed? What stayed the same? When was your character challenged? When did you try new things? 
 
Example: I really developed my passion for music throughout high school. Before high school, I practiced the violin because my parents wanted me to play an instrument and forced me to sit in a chair for 2 hours each night to play the same songs over and over again. That obligation nearly broke me; by 8th grade, I had become completely dispassionate about music. At one point, I even considered breaking my bow just to avoid another day in front of my music stand. It wasn’t until the passing of my grandmother during my freshman year that I realized the love I had for music and developed a desire to play the violin for intrinsic reasons. That bow I so callously thought of breaking? It and my violin were passed down to me from my grandmother’s father—his prized possession that he carried with him when he immigrated to the United States. Before my grandmother passed, she looked at me and said how proud she was of me for carrying on her father’s tradition. When she said that, I felt as if her feeble hands had punched me; how could she be proud of me when I had been so immature about playing music? The next time I sat before my music stand, I looked at my violin with new eyes, and became determined to play the instrument with as much zeal as my great-grandfather must have. It made me realize that there are things in life that I might resent doing at first, but they must be done. And not only must they be done, but they shouldn’t be done begrudgingly; instead, I must deeply ruminate about the value—not pain—these obligations might bring to my life, and relish each opportunity to grow my character and learn something new. 

**How I'm different from my peers**

Things to keep in mind: Only include positive details. Don't say that you're antisocial and don't get along with anyone (even if that's true). Instead, spin that bit of info into a positive: ""Although I'm more reserved than many of my peers, my quietude enables me to soak up knowledge and insight from every angle."" You can talk about how you have a thirst for knowledge that is uncharacteristic of many students, how you have a really focused interest on XYZ, how you've had some really awesome research opportunity that isn't afforded to many high school students, or how your minority status has given you a new perspective on the world. Don't just include positive details about yourself—stay positive about your peers, too. Don't put them down. Don't say ""while all my classmates are lazy, I'm really driven."" Instead, say ""While many kids are still figuring out their passions in high school, I'm already incredibly driven to do XYZ."" Get the difference? All this will help your teacher to say ""he/she is unlike any student I've encountered in that he/she is XYZ.""
 
**My hopes for college**
 
Things to keep in mind: Don’t generically say you hope to go to college. Instead, be specific regarding what you’d like to study, what type of learning environment you seek, and possibly mention your list of universities to which you’re applying. While your teacher won’t likely write a personalized essay to each school, it’s a good idea to inform them of universities to which you’re applying so they can tailor their essay to the general environment of those universities.
 
**My three best qualities**
 
Things to keep in mind: Don’t say hardworking, perfectionist, driven, or any other cliched statements that every high school student and his/her mother would use to describe themselves. Instead, Google “adjectives to describe yourself in an interview” and write down a list of every adjective that applies to you/your character. Once you’re done making that list, cross off the cliches and narrow your list to refreshing words that describe your character and help you stand out from others. A word like methodical, for example, could describe similar qualities as hardworking and perfectionist, but it’s a much less commonly used word and thus stands out more amongst the crowd. Don’t just list those three words, but give a short example of why you embody that adjective.
 
**My greatest accomplishments**
 
Things to keep in mind: You can mention an award you won, a position for which you were elected in a club, a grade you worked hard to achieve, a character trait you developed, and many other things. Don’t feel that you haven’t had any accomplishments—of course you have. Maybe you and your softball team won an important match, you turned your C in algebra into a B after tons of studying, you befriended the oddball new kid, learned a new language, or you helped your little sister learn to play soccer despite her two left feet. Your accomplishment doesn’t have to be grandiose, but it does have to tell your teacher something about yourself that they might not know just from having you in class.
 
**Challenges I’ve faced**
 
Things to keep in mind: If you’ve experienced any challenges whatsoever, feel free to add this section and describe them. If you haven’t experienced any challenges, you can omit this section. Challenges include moving schools, learning a new language after immigrating to a new country, coming out, overcoming a learning disability, losing a loved one, having to take on considerable responsibilities at home/in a family business, being homeless, dealing with your own or a loved one’s illness (both mental and/or physical), enduring abuse, struggling to get a good grade in a class, etc. Give your teacher context for any low grades you might have received, absences, etc., and specifically describe how you have overcome these issues or what you are currently doing to overcome these issues. This last part is crucial.
 
**Why I am grateful that you’ve agreed to write this letter of recommendation on my behalf**
 
Things to keep in mind: Write a quick thank you at the end of your letter to your teacher, thanking them for the time they’ll spend penning your letter of recommendation. These things take a TON of time, so give your teacher some gratitude. Plus, maybe it’ll help them write nice things about you ;)

However, a few things concern me so I'd like the opinion of people in the field already.

1.) I live in a relatively small town. Most, if not all, IT jobs stem from two places in the town. Those two being an energy company and the hospital. The closest place that offers a larger variety in about 2 hours away. Im wondering if after I leave college should I put a focus on moving.

2.) I've been speaking with a lot of my professors about if I should continue my education outside of an associate. Many say that I should stick with the associates and some certs. They say most employers won't care for a bachelor, and it is something I can come back to if my employer thinks I need it.

3.) Working for the government intrigues me. I like the idea of the stability and protecting my country in anyway I can. Is something I should look into first? Or something I should focus a few years down the line.

4.) Should I focus on coding? If so what languages?

5.) Would my two years in retail help me snag an entry level job at a help desk or is it irrelevant 

The college I'm in is offering a lot of resources, so I feel the spot I'm in is a good one. I plan to have an internship by next year as well thaks to the college. Thank you everyone if I missed anything let me know. Sorry if this is a messed this is fueld by paranoia and caffeine haha

I really enjoy my job so far and really like this job but, at times there just isn't very much to do. I will have days every once in a while where I have pretty much finished the tasks I've been assigned to. So all that's often left in my backlog of requirements are requirements that is awaiting a specification, or it is difficult to recreate the conditions for the bug, or is awaiting 3rd party confirmation. Or the requirements are low priority and difficult to understand how to solve.


What am I supposed to do during this time? Usually I will just look at those requirements lacking a specification and figure out myself more or less what needs to be done and try and play around and see what I can do and if I can figure it out or not. Or I will play around the test environment trying to recreate the test conditions for those lower priority bug fixes that has to be done. Somehow just seems like a bit of a waste of time though and that I should be doing more useful work and learning more.


I asked my co-workers and my manager and once in a while that helps and they hand me some more tasks. Sometimes I dig around the backlog and see if there's any suitable ones that are not assigned to anyone else and give it a shot. 


Does anyone have any advice what to do when there just isn't that much to do? I wanna learn more and I don't want my coworkers to think I am not contributing and slacking off. "

Out of the blue, Company X the place I'm currently interning at offers me a full-time position.  I've already begun looking for apartments to move to near Company Y and was ready to sign a short term lease... but money talks...


Company X:  Offering me average starting salary (above my asking), great benefits, 401, health, etc, relocation bonus and extra bonus for having to rescind my internship offer with Company Y.  Located in a relatively small beach town.  


Company Y:  3 Month Internship after I graduate just for the summer, no promises on a full-time offer.  Offering relocation bonus (enough to cover the entire 3 months and some).  Pay is higher than my current internship but not higher than the full-time salary being offered obviously.  Location is in big city metropolitan.   

Both positions are for Finance/Business Analyst roles.  I feel like as a new graduate I would want to move into a big, happening city like LA or SF - but also I think the full-time position is a safer bet as far as my career goes.

&amp;nbsp;


I'm a rising senior looking to become a software engineer/dev next year. I'm interning at a very large fortune 100 company for the summer and I find out that I won't be doing any software engineering or coding at all.


&amp;nbsp;


The internship posting I applied to was actually called ""IT Intern"". Since this large corporation recruits hundreds of interns(no exaggeration) every summer, they had one internship posting called ""IT intern"". According to its description, this posting acted as an umbrella covering many intern positions, spanning from IT ones like cyber security to CS ones like application development.


&amp;nbsp;


Since I listed my major as Computer Science, I foolishly assumed they would put me on the app dev team. 


&amp;nbsp;


Turns out I'm wrong.


&amp;nbsp;


They didn't tell me what my assignment was until the 2nd day. My project for the summer is to create a plan to migrate on-premise virtual machines/applications to a public cloud like AWS or Azure. Now, I don't know anything about servers or VMs let alone how to migrate them onto a public cloud.


&amp;nbsp;


Oddly, my supervisor told me to go research cloud migration last Tuesday and has never bothered to check up on me since then. So even though I could've spent the time browsing youtube/reddit, I've actually tried researching cloud migration but it is very hard to focus as I don't find the topic to be interesting at all. I'd rather be coding.

Luckily this company pays well and provides a housing stipend. 


&amp;nbsp;


So my dilemma is I don't know if I should just quit and work on a large programming project this summer or just stick it out. Obviously having an IT internship is better than having no internship but I'm having a miserable time.


&amp;nbsp;



TL;DR version

-OP, a CS major, applies for IT internship thinking he would be doing app dev

-OP doesn't find out until 2nd day that he's actually doing cloud migration.

-OP knows nothing about AWS/Azure public clouds.

-This is OP's only internship. OP is a rising senior and can't get anymore summer internships"

I need help getting a job.",GetHighr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6dellr/23_and_no_job_history_still_in_community_college/,"Hello /r/jobs, I am 23 years old. I am currently in community college studying for Computer Information Systems. At the age of 16 I founded a gaming website and made some money. I handled SQL database and tinkered with PHP and HTML. That all went to an end when an Arabian hacker destroyed my website. I was forced to learn how to learn networking security and harden my PHP on the website. Needless to say by the time I learned that my website had lost its traffic. 

My dad is self employed working on RVs (collision repair), I started helping him out with that and learned a lot of bodywork, preparation and even spray painting colors and clearcoat. Unfortunately I do not have any record that I actually work in this or have any experience. Since it's summer time a lot of RVs are put of state or out of the dealers, so my dad's job completely shuts down and we have no work. He supports us by buying cars from car auctions and fixing them up. I have a bunch of tools and experience in this field and I've worked for many dealerships with my dad and the owners/managers would probably be willing to vouch for me. However I am more interested in working in IT. 

My main concern is that I do not have any creditable job experience. I can likely become self employed but I'd rather do it on the side. I would like to begin my career in IT. I was thinking of going to my community college (Chaffey community college) and seeing if there are any internships or jobs available for me there. What do you guys think? I would appreciate any help. I have around 500 dollars in my savings and I have to spend around 200 dollars on bills every month. I am able to do some odds and ends here and there so I am sure I can hang on a bit. My parents already help me enough with free rent and food so I am extremely grateful for that. 

Amazon has a warehouse in my city and my brother was easily hired there so I plan on working there for the meantime. In fact I feel that working there is smart to possibly earn some loyalty points with Amazon and join their junior IT department. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Thanks."

I have a bad habit of taking on responsibilities and projects I don't have the time to do. I've been working, leading club activities, and co-founded a fledgling community Makerspace with my fellow students. 

I struggled with a load a lot of you probably might scoff at (and for anyone else, it WAS hard) I was taking 5 classes: thermodynamics, dynamics, and engineering design, as well two chem classes required for my major.

I also moved off campus to live with friends in the middle of the semester, to deal with the loneliness of not having friends on campus.

Due to some GPA magic, I got a 3.4 for my last semester, which is gone since I failed 3-ish classes this semester. But I managed to get an engineering internship for the summer with the old one, the best opportunity I've ever had. I need to make this work since it could be the chance to feel like this is at all possible.

I'm often constantly depressed because I scrape by much of the time. I feel like the students I look up to do the same and more.

What I'm doing: Reducing my course load, looking for a (related, fingers crossed) part time job to pay for school, restudying (it hurts) over the summer to nail my classes next time, start seeing a therapist, running and lifting weights to deal with my stress better, and cooking meals in advance to eat healthier and save money.

If you are engineering student, you get lots of labs to do. And if you are not good at social, you probably have difficult in finding labs partner in upper year. 

If you told me finding good US job is easy if you graduate from this school, then you are wrong. You are only making assumption that you are Canadian. I have seen US company give full time offer to international student, but without visa it is illegal to hire them so those international students cannot really work in US even they graduate, not like international student graduate from any US school can have CPT and not like Canadian can apply TN and work in US.

You try hard to get US intern ,and now what? you cannot work in US fulltime though.

What can be worse? The library is full during the midterm and final, and people like making noise there. The school is using my tuition to build those building and none of them are for study space. My tuition is fucking expensive, more expensive than yours, and what can I say?

There is no fine dining here, ALL shitty Chinese resturants in Plaza,
unless you can drive, but you get no friends that can drive, I mean, you are making friends with those that study hard, not those kids that drive, and you are not good at social , remember, you English is only professional, not native, you don't understand those cultural reference.

What can I say? 
I really regret going to U of Waterloo, I rather go UBC or U of T, they have way better facility, way more selections of food, I rather pay higher tuition for that.

It is just stupid to live in this place, you get poor study place, people do not have good taste, poor working oppotunity compared to US, any hard working International student here, if they were student in US, they can easily get intern offer from those US company. including Uber, snap, MS, AWS, those are just easy for US students.

6dfgu8,51,2017-05-26,The Unknown Sample,Kendersarecooler,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6dfgu8/the_unknown_sample/,"I work for a small medical laboratory, and generally the things we are sent are mutated viruses, or potentially hazardous spores from around the country. Normally we are contracted by either the CDC or directly by a Medical School. The thing that brings me here is the first time I've ever seen a package arrive with a Department of Defense stamp on the box. That was on Monday. As of this writing it is late at night on Thursday. 

I was nervous as soon as I saw the red-ink stamp. My 'Mentor' at the firm seemed just as freaked out by the thing as I was even before opening it, and that woman has nerves of steel. It was her first time seeing the Government seal as well. She confided as much to me. I should probably be honest here, no sense in trying to cover it up now. We have been having an affair since we've been locked away out here. What did the guys at the top expect when we're isolated?

That fraternization directive is bullshit. I'm starting to think this company is more closely related to the Military than we were lead to believe. “Privately Owned” my ass. That's all really irrelevant to what I came here to tell you. She opened the plain brown packaging paper to find a white cardboard box with the words Handle With Care stenciled on the outside. This gave us both pause once again, and I could tell by the way her eyebrows furrowed she was more than nervous.

“Let's take this to the Clean Room.” She said softly, and I simply nodded my head, being her intern, and not exactly having the ability to argue. We dressed in the thin plastic suits, helping one another fasten the hoods to the suits as we came out of the decontamination chamber. The doctor moved to retrieve the sample box from the slot in the far wall before moving toward the bench near me. I was already soaked with sweat inside the suit, the drops stinging my eyes.

I blinked until the burning went away and watched the woman that I had come to love open the box, as she had seemed to be waiting for me. I don't know what either of us were expecting, but when she extracted an ordinary looking vial of small, black spores from inside the package, I could feel the wave of relief sweep through the room dispelling some of the tension. We unfastened and removed the hoods, placing them on the desk behind us.

Doctor Smith (for the purposes of this story at least) pulled one of the small black spheres from the vial and placed it in a resealable plastic box. I felt safe enough to approach the thing after it was closed. She instructed me to turn on the computer and the monitor sitting next to the microscope that she placed the box beneath. When the machines had powered up she adjusted the focus of the microscope while I collected a clipboard, already jotting down where the sample came from along with our names.

I also quickly jotted down a description of the object. I dug the small digital recorder from the pocket of my lab coat, switching it on so that the woman could describe the thing, and I could transcribe it later. Doctor Smith also ran a few other tests on the thing, before switching off the recorder. We both stared at the thing as if it might suddenly strike, like a rattlesnake or scorpion, and the woman beside me broke the momentary silence abruptly.

“Should we see if we can induce bursting?” She asked, and as my head turned, I caught a faint glimmer in her eye. It was the same look that had led to our complicated personal situation. I nodded, though my blood felt like glacial water in my veins. She moved the sample, carefully, with the elongated forceps she had used to remove it from the vial, from the tiny plastic examination container into a larger container which had long rubber gloves that reached inside to allow access to the specimen before sealing the top of said bullet-proof container.

She placed a small needle in a metal slot that allowed the transfer of instruments into the sealed box. The doctor placed her arms in the rubber gloves and retrieved the scalpel and forceps. Fascinated and curious I almost unwillingly stepped toward the box to watch the woman manipulate the tiny ball. The thing was no bigger than an airsoft pellet, and for the first time I noticed the odd striations of brassy coloration on the thing.

“Was that there before?” I asked the much more knowledgeable woman as I indicated the bands of brown color with the tip of the pen in my grip. She shook her head and looked back at the small object just in time to see the entire thing turn a coppery color, then burst into fine dust. It barely left a husk behind. Doctor Smith removed her hands from the thick rubber cases almost instinctively. The tiny grit seemed to float forever before coating every surface of the observation box.

We exchanged another concerned glance, but I also saw the woman steeling herself, detaching her emotions from the scientific part of herself. I envied her in that moment. I'll admit here and now that the eruption of the small spore had frightened me for some reason. It was a primal feeling, rooted in the deepest part of my psyche. I wish I could have turned it off as she had, maybe I wouldn't be as frightened now, either.

I'm getting ahead of myself again, and I apologize, but I really do think my time is running short here. Back to what I was saying. After the dust settled in the container, the doctor and I reattached the hoods to the clean suits. After that was done, she opened the top of the box, reaching into the container to pull the spore husk that remained on the bottom, and place it in the smaller box, for closer examination. She also walked to the right, opening a cupboard to grab a cotton swab.

She opened the foil package and swiped the head of the swab against the side of the large box that the spore had burst inside, closing the small plastic enclosure around the cotton puff before placing the swab into a Bio-hazard envelope. She sealed that into a larger, bubble-wrap filled envelope and jotted the address to OSU's Botany lab on the outside. She dismissed me before moving a small, plastic chair near the computer.

I went through the decontamination procedure and peeled the plastic suit from my body before heading to the showers, rinsing away the sweat coating my thin form. I walked to the small kitchen after redressing, and made myself a package of Top Ramen, pan-frying an eight ounce steak to cut into small cubes and mix into the noodles after draining away the water I had boiled them in. I ate quickly, surprised by how hungry I was and found my way to a vending machine, buying a bottle of iced tea.

Once I finished drinking the beverage and eating my noodles and steak, I rinsed my dish, placing it into a plastic strainer next to the utilitarian faucet. I walked into the sleeping quarters which were just as spartan and bare. I lay in the metal-frame bed and tried to sleep, laying on my back with my eyelids clenched tightly closed to no avail. I gave in and rolled onto my side, retrieving my well-read copy of Stephen King's 'Misery' intending to read until I got drowsy.

That plan was thwarted by a gentle rapping at my door. The woman had apparently finished her examination for the night, and wanted to spend time with me. It was better than reading a story I could probably recite by heart, so I rose from my bed and followed doctor Smith to her much more comfortable sleeping area. She moved to the full-sized refrigerator and freezer combo that took up a corner of her room, turning to ask “Do you want something to drink?” as she walked that direction. I settled for a bottle of water. 

The rest of that night was uneventful, and so was the first half of the morning. When we put on new clean suits and entered the room we had examined the spore in, however things started to take a turn toward the strange for the lack of a better term. The fine brown dust that had coated the interior of the box had changed color and consistency yet again. It was dark green, and no longer light, ashy-looking flakes.

The stuff had become small granules of sand to go along with its new coloration. We moved simultaneously to examine the husk that the substance had exploded from. The thing seemed to have grown small, tubular roots, something like the roots that a potato grows. We both looked from the thing to the other, shock mirrored in our opposite hued eyes, hers brown, my own blue. My heart took a jolt upward before plummeting toward the ground.

“What the hell?” I breathed quietly. The doctor's eyes met mine through the clear windows in the hoods of the suits. “That's what I'd like to know.” she said, and for the first time I had met her, I saw the cold, calculating mask slip for the first time in a lab setting, her voice as shaky as I felt. Doctor Smith approached the small box containing the husk, approaching it as one would get nearer to a coiled rattlesnake.

Against every instinct inside me, I followed until she waved me toward the large, sand-coated box. “I need you to take some samples of the substance over there.” her voice was already calmer, distant. I could practically hear the wheels in her head turning. I moved to the cupboard, collecting a pair of swabs along with a small paint brush and a urine test cup. I opened the top of the large box and used the swabs first, collecting as much of the sandy pollen for lack of a better term as I could.

I closed the plastic tube around the end of the swab, repeating the process with the second object. I then collected a bit more of the grainy substance in the plastic cup, tightly securing the lid. I set the samples on a metal tray and turned back to see the doctor turning the root-covered husk over in the light, using a pair of long forceps to grasp the brittle, dry membrane. Though, as I approached I noticed that the thing didn't look as fragile as it had even moments ago.

We almost collided and I stopped short of the disaster. She deftly sidestepped my confused frame, moving back toward the microscope, speaking with her back to me once again. “Take those samples down to the Biology lab, would you?” I didn't waste time, and paused at the door to turn back to her. “I'm going to grab something to eat on my way back. I'm starving.” I said softly, and the hood of her suit nodded faintly before I left.

I stripped out of the suit, but put on a pair of thick rubber gloves before I reclaimed the sample containers, carrying them toward the stairwell rather than taking the singular elevator. I didn't want to see anyone I knew for fear of babbling everything that had happened into their unsuspecting ear. I was suitably isolated in the cramped space, feet carrying me down the concrete platforms rather slowly. I was in no hurry to get back into the proximity of the sprouting thing.

I arrived at the window to the laboratory, and filled out the half page form, before handing off the swabs and container. I felt a bit of weight lift off my shoulders as I stripped the gloves off inside-out before tossing them into the trash can. True to my word, I headed for the cafeteria, taking the elevator this time to the middle of the three floor facility, following the brightly lit hallways to the kitchen, where I got a tuna fish sandwich and a bottle of pomegranate juice.

I ate my meal slowly, though the food was bland, as most mass produced stuff is, but I couldn't really complain. I was almost on auto-pilot when I threw away my trash and placed the tray in the molded slot behind the hole in the top of the garbage receptacle. I walked back to the elevator, and stepped inside, but my fingers hesitated over the row of buttons. I eventually pressed the button that would carry me to the lobby and made my way out the front door.

I walked to the smoking area and bummed a cigarette from one of the security guard. The smoke was unfamiliar tasting, as it had been more than a year since I had quit, and it even caused me to cough, my lungs burning like I was sixteen again. Halfway through the paper tube, it stopped hurting and a slight high rocked my brain.

My nerves had also settled from their slightly jittery state, and I felt mentally well enough to walk back into the facility after I ground out the cigarette butt. I made my way to the elevator, riding back down to the floor with the lab, donning a brand-new clean suit, putting it on securely before I made my way back to the room that Doctor Smith was standing in. She had the viewing window up against the eyepieces of the microscope at first, but eventually she turned her head to look at me.

“Come here. I want to show you something.” she said, and a lot of the vacant tone in her voice had vanished. I walked toward her, a slight case of the jitters already stirring up inside me. “Take a look in there and tell me what you see.” the woman said, her voice still neutral. I maneuvered my head around inside the baggy hood, until I could see the object under the lens. In the magnified view, I could see some faint, barely there lines within the tuberous growths.

There were also small balls forming along the sides of each of the apparent root structures. I turned to look at the more qualified employee, my mind reeling. “What am I seeing here?” I asked, my head spinning a bit more quickly. She didn't answer, even when I stepped back, turning my expectant face toward the wiser of us. She only shrugged and shook her head, eyebrows drawing toward each other in a look of pensive frustration.

She removed the sample from the observation platform, moving it toward a different, slightly smaller box than the one the unknown ball had exploded inside. She noted the time before placing the small, clear container inside the larger, opaque box. We exited the clean room, and stripped off the noisy plastic suits. I excused myself for another break, and she only nodded, the emotional distance again creeping between us, the beginnings of a rift forming.

She didn't come for me that night, but I didn't give it any thought at first. It was only when she hadn't appeared by almost eleven on Wednesday morning, that I began to get suspicious. She wasn't in her quarters or the cafeteria, either. When I asked security, they would only tell me that she had applied for and gotten a pass approved at around five that morning. I sat around the day room and twiddled my thumbs until Doctor Smith eventually returned around one.

She dodged my inquiries into her whereabouts, the distance between her and I seemingly having doubled in the hours we had been apart. She sent me back to the lab I had visited the day before to retrieve the results of two of the tests that had been ordered the afternoon before. I quickly took a lunch break, if only to escape the uncomfortable feeling whenever the woman was around. I also slipped back out to the smoking area, bumming another cigarette. The tube of carcinogens was less intoxicating and nauseating than the day before. 


It still helped to calm my nerves, and also soothe my slightly wounded feelings. I bummed another cigarette from the man, and he also spared me a book of matches, which I tucked into my lab coat pocket. I ventured back inside and made my way to the cafeteria, again taking my time on the stairs. I ate slowly again as well before I braved the journey back to the clean room, again donning a plastic suit.

As I approached the second door, I heard low mumbling. Doctor Smith was talking to someone, but I could hear no reply. I stood outside the laboratory, straining to hear exactly what she was saying, but I still didn't manage to make out her words, only the soothing, soft tone of her speech, as if she were talking to an animal of some sort. I almost turned back, but for some reason I did not, and Doctor Smith's voice halted as the door opened.

“How are you?” She asked, her voice more warm and sweet than it had been for nearing twenty four hours. I had to physically swallow the lump in my throat, along with the fear I was feeling. When we made eye contact, though, I forced myself to smile. “I'm fine. Just curious about your trip earlier.” I said, and she again met my words with silence, her eyes straying toward the files on the table. She diverted me into the study of the strange object.

From what results that our lab could give us, the thing was definitely some sort of fungal spore. There was no analogous fungus in our hemisphere, however, and we wouldn't know more for a few hours more. The doctor also seemed to be keeping me away from the actual husk of the thing, antagonizing my earlier suspicion and fear. After transferring the lab results into the clean room computer, I again excused myself for a break.

She looked almost relieved at first and I quickly stripped away the plastic outer garment once again, shoving it into one of the bio-hazard bins as I fought the urge to simply flee into the forest as fast as I could. The compulsion was irrational and sudden, and I attributed it to my earlier fear. I smoked the last cigarette I had borrowed alone in the small shelter. I didn't want to go back inside, but I had to. I did take a detour however, into the security office, for the second time that day.

“Can I help you?” the man behind the counter asked me, his face puzzled but slightly amused behind thick-framed glasses. “I need a pass to town.” I said quickly, in almost full on blurt mode. The man nodded his head and handed me a small packet of forms to fill out. The information they wanted was bordering on invasive, but I filled out every line, seriously doubting that the woman I had come to know and love had been comfortable with doing so.

I handed the man the packet and he told me that I had a few hours to wait, which again set off the alarms in my brain. Then again, the woman had a much higher security clearance than myself. I forced myself to take a walk to the floor that housed the cafeteria, using a rest room there before moving into the common area. In a way I was disappointed when I saw the large room nearly deserted besides the people who served the food and a pair of security personnel.

I ordered a large Styrofoam cup of lentil soup. I grabbed a bottle of apple juice from the refrigerator and found a place to sit and eat my meal, again wishing for the buzz of conversation around me to distract me from my rising feelings of fear. There was nothing to soothe me this time and I nearly climbed out of my skin even as I forced myself to swallow the thin broth. I finished the large container and then drank the bottle of juice rapidly. I managed to wrangle my inner turmoil as I discarded my trash.

I walked back toward the stairwell, walking up to the living quarters. I opened the door to my room and stepped inside, again refusing to return to the lab where the woman I thought I knew was currently doing God-knew-what. There wasn't much to distract me in the blank walled room, either and I felt a sense of very real heat forming in my chest and stomach as fear and frustration reared their ugly heads inside me once more.

I started pacing the small amount of floor space, just to do something, trying to force my mind to remain blank. Questions buzzed through my brain like angry hornets, and none of them had answers. I had to get out of the room that I had quarantined myself in, the feelings inside me threatening to force me literally up one of the walls. I opened the door and walked out into the hall before freezing in place, unsure of where to go.

I didn't want to pester the man about my pass, but I was still full. I walked to the stairwell, again climbing to the lobby and walking out into the shaded courtyard. I cut across the finely manicured grass once more, toward the smoking shelter. Thankfully a different person was in the small shack, and I quickly bummed a cigarette from them, as well as using their lighter. I didn't try to engage the man in conversation, and he reciprocated.

He finished his cigarette sooner than I did, and I borrowed another cancer stick from him before he walked away. I finished my own smoke, but lingered in the mild afternoon breeze, feeling less restless than when I was in the small subterranean room. I inhaled the clean, pine-scented air and closed my eyes, listening to the sounds of the birds and insects around me. The raging storm inside me lessened slightly and I exhaled, inhaling deeply once more.

I calmed down a little further, and even walked a large circle in the grass, basking in the feel of the wind in my face and hair. I let my eyes roll languidly open and  felt composed enough to walk back into the building, making my way to the small security room. The man behind the desk wasn't there, and I only lingered for a few minutes. I made my way back outside, eyes scanning the narrow track that served as the road that led to the facility.

I then looked to the left and right of the dirt road, scanning the treeline, again considering bolting, my feet even carrying me toward the woods a bit before I was able to stop myself, though I did follow the ruts in the dirt for a hundred or so yards. I walked just far enough to confirm that there was indeed a man inside the small booth. I felt a slight pang of disappointment, and turned around, walking back to the smoke shack.

I don't know how long I waited for the first guard I had bummed a cigarette from appeared, but I was grateful that he did, my nerves fraying again, doctor Smith's strange, muffled conversation with nobody playing through my mind, tightening my chest and stomach. I bummed a couple cigarettes from him, as well as a another pair of strike anywhere matches, using one of the matches to light one of the nicotine tubes. 

We smoked in silence, and walked back toward the squat structure at the same time, though we still didn't speak as we mounted the few steps to the smoked-glass doors. I used the elevator to go back to the cafeteria, buying a large cup of coffee. I carried the beverage to a table where I could observe the door. A thought fluttered through my head, and it was probably the first time I had realized that I hadn't seen the doctor eat in almost two days. This sparked an idea, which in retrospect, led me to the predicament I am currently in.

The next time I stopped into the small office, the man behind the desk told me in no uncertain terms that my pass had been denied. I didn't bother him any more than I needed to, and the thought of slipping into the woods again occurred to me, and this time I gave it a little more serious thought. I lingered around the lobby until I felt the same sense of entrapment that had almost sent me screaming into the now dark forest.

The rumbling of my stomach thankfully derailed my train of thought. I used the elevator, making my way back to the cafeteria, where to my surprise, the room was moderately full, providing the background noise I still very much needed. I ate a couple of pieces of fried chicken, quieting the rumbling in my gut. My eyes strayed to the entrance of the room, hoping to catch the doctor on her way in to get something to eat.

I was disappointed that she still hadn't made an appearance, and I realized that I couldn't stall any more. I used the stairs again, walking slowly down to the floor that housed to the lab. I walked into the small locker room, and Doctor Smith nearly collided with me, and then without so much as a glance at me, or a mumbled apology, continued on her way. I almost followed her, but suited up and continued into the clean room. 

I moved to the large box first, and was relieved to see that the substance seemed to have stayed in its sandy form, and mostly still there. There were a few places where samples had been taken, but it didn't seem too excessive. I started to relax, just slightly, though I was still feeling jittery as I walked toward the side of the room she had placed the husk. I opened the blacked-out box, and peered inside, my stomach lurching when I didn't see the sample container inside.

I pivoted on my heel and started to walk toward the door, the barrier swinging in to meet me at the absolute wrong time. As I think back on it, my finger touching the tender split above my right eye, where the rigid plastic had severed my flesh after dislodging from the lighter plastic around it, I think she did it on purpose. I should have realized that as she was on top of me as soon as I had hit the ground. 

There was something off in her eyes, a swirling, almost squirming movement in the normally entrancing depths. Along with that though, was pure, feral hatred. The vocalizations she was making were human sounding, but shrill and inarticulate, a far cry from her usual slightly aloof manor. I don't know how long we were struggling, but she eventually managed to completely remove my face shield, her fingers clawing at my face and eyes.

I realized as she tore burning furrows into my cheek that simply restraining the woman wasn't going to be enough. I started to buck and wriggle under her as she slapped and clawed at me, screaming like a banshee all the while, her harsh screams only serving to disorient me along with the stinging blows and scratching. I managed to separate the woman from me enough to stand and planted my feet once I had. “Stop!” I said, but only once as she scrambled to her own vertical base.

She charged me without warning, and I managed to stay on my feet for an admirable period of time, as strong as she was. We reeled across the floor, looking like a couple dancing a drunken, violent waltz until she slammed my kidneys into the edge of the counter that held the box of sand-like pollen (for lack of a better term). The sharp pain caused me to hesitate just long enough for her to gain the upper hand, wrestling me around to slam my head off the steel-plated surface. I felt my nose squash, and heard the pop along with the immediate swelling below each of my eyes.

Twin rivers of copper-tinged blood flowed into my shocked, gaping mouth as she slammed me forward again, this time my forehead connecting with, and fracturing the box that held the pollen. She let me go when I let my muscles relax, barely holding on to my consciousness. The woman dragged me into the center of the lab, and almost reverently pulled the flimsy hood off my head. The fury of earlier was gone, replaced by an eerie calm.

My bleary eyes didn't allow me to see a whole lot of detail, and just staying awake was a chore. Doctor Smith pressed something against my narrowly-closed lips, and then past them. I tried to eject whatever it was, but the thing practically slithered down my throat, as if it wanted to be swallowed. That was when I heard the commotion in the hall, and heavy footsteps. Black clad figures swept the room, shooting the woman when she foolishly tried to rush them as she had me.

I was loaded into a Life Flight helicopter and taken to a Veteran's Hospital, where I am posting this from. The reconstructive surgery on my shattered nose and orbital bones went well, and I look pretty much like my old self. The thing is, they still have me under observation here, and besides a few hours a day to exercise and eat, or even browse the internet, I am being tested in some way. I am starting to think I may never get to go home, and that's all I want to do.

There is one other minor detail. Since I was exposed to whatever that spore released, I've had horrible nausea and it's getting hard to make myself eat.

I am a long time lurker here, decided to post for some advice.

My last final was today and I was wondering if you have any advice as to what I can do to progress my career one last summer before I graduate this fall.

Thanks for your advice."
6dfmfg,8,2017-05-26,Advice on MIS degree/systems analysis? Starting over for CS degree?,Bolshedik497,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6dfmfg/advice_on_mis_degreesystems_analysis_starting/,"TLDR: Anyone with systems analysis/MIS background that could teach me a thing or two about it? Preferably in regards to Texas?

First some back story: So, I'm currently an accounting major. Just had an internship at a Big 4 firm and realized I hated everything about it. My dad recommended I look into computer science, so I've been doing lessons on codeacademy for the past couple months and found that I REALLY enjoy coding. I started looking into a CS degree at my school, but realized I would essentially have to completely restart college (I currently have 93 credits towards my accounting degree and maybe 2 or 3 classes would transfer towards the cs curriculum). I just can't afford that. I'm already neck deep in student loans as it is.

So, I started looking into MIS. But, the MIS program offers essentially zero programming classes (there's one for Python, Ruby, PHP, .NET but that's it). The advisor said MIS majors do get hired for software engineering jobs but I feel like that's unlikely and, if so, wouldn't I be miles behind a CS major, even if I got a CS minor?

This brings me to systems analysis. It seems like the next best thing and I keep reading that it's a growing field but, from research i've done, it seems very 50/50 on job security, satisfaction, pay, work/life balance, etc. depending on the company. I'm in Texas so I've been looking at mostly the Dallas and Austin area.

Should I just bite the bullet and try to start over with the CS degree since software engineering is what really interests me? I've heard great things about this major/career path.

I've had several sleepless nights because of this since I basically have to make this decision before next semester starts and/or classes fill up. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!!!"

I'm a Intern in a Red Team position in a european country,  I finished a ""Telecommunications Engineering"" degree with a 9.5/10 in my final essay about pentest in july 2016 and found this internship in october.

Currently I'm 8 months in and we are mainly doing nothing because bureaucracy, I mainly had done some Python strings for copying files, converting and scraping them etc... 

Currently I'm reading the ""Art of Exploitation"" by Jon Erikson and practicing a bit with VulnHub VM, I want to take the OSCP the sooner that I can but my company won't pay for it because I'm an Intern.

My internship finishes in october of 2017 and I'm not sure if I want to stay. I want to be the best pentester that I can and don't want to specialize soon, but is difficult to be self-motivated when your work is not taken into account and all you have is dry books and few practical exercises. Currently I live 20 min walking from work and the pay is enough to live and save some for the future. What would you do in my situation?"

Today I am going to call start up web development companies (as I want to major in web dev) and kindly ask for internship opportunities. I've emailed numerous companies my resume since this January and none have responded, so my dad said I should call the companies.

I know there's a slim chance of me even getting the internship because college students are whom companies love employing, but it wouldn't hurt to call and ask, and unlike college students, my standards for being accepted as an intern are a lot lower.

I have contact info for over a dozen companies so getting rejected from some really won't harm me and stop me from calling other ones.

How do I talk with the companies, though? Should I just introduce myself and  say this: ""Hello, my name is ----, and I am a rising senior in ---- high school and I am looking for a summer internship. I wanted to know if you are currently looking for interns, as I am passionate about web development and will do nothing but benefit your company."" Or is there something better for me to say?

Also, will saying ""I don't know"" be acceptable if they ask a question I don't know the answer to?

Are there any other general tips/guildlines you have for me so I can hopefully be successful with my calls to the companies? I really want to impress them if they're looking for new interns, including high school ones.

6dhxab,1,2017-05-26,Weighing the options for buying/building a new computer,peebsunz,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6dhxab/weighing_the_options_for_buyingbuilding_a_new/,"This summer I've been lucky enough to work at an internship that pays me very well.  I've been a slight video game fanatic since I was 12, but have tempered it down a bit while I'm in college to make time to study and be more social. 

I've been looking to build a new computer so I won't have to use my laptop to do homework or play games.  I can afford it, but I'm starting to think the money could go towards something else.  I would be paying $1500 for all the parts and the new monitor, but I'm beginning to fear that I'll regress to the gaming recluse that I was before I started college.  

I won't lie, I'm not the most social person, and my social/love life are pretty much nil during the summer.  I know all this comes from when I was younger and used to play video games to ignore my loneliness, and I don't want to have that same crutch for when I'm alone at college.  I want to be able to play video games casually, but I don't know if I trust myself to do that while still trying to be more social.  

Essentially, the pros for the computer are:
-much easier to do homework/render stuff (I refuse to do homework on this crappy laptop)
-video games are much more fun
-browsing/looking up information/random business endeavors becomes much easier

The cons are
-cost ($1500) could go towards other things that might improve my self-image 
-possible regression to the same gamer recluse that I was in high school.  I'm not too social now but that can change if I don't have the ""gaming alternative""

Disclaimer: As I'm writing this I'm going through a multi-day panic attack so forgive me if I ramble at all. I just feel as if I'm backed into a corner and have no for-sure moves to make in the future.

I just finished my first year at uni, and due to transferring a shit ton of college credits I only have two years of school left. I go to school at a notorious party school in NC and we are virtually non-existent to tech recruiters. Because of this I'm really worried for ___ reasons.

1) I'm technically a junior in terms of credits and time left, but a freshman in terms of knowledge. I don't know anything  more than just basic C++ and Java and how to implement data structures in C++. I don't know anything about OOP or any other necessary topics in CS besides the ones mentioned above. 

2) Because of (1) I am freaking out. There's no way in hell I am prepared for a technical interview, but any internship I've seen is interviewing students in the Fall. I can fumble my way through CTCI and HackerRank easy and medium data structures questions, but that's it. I'm a complete beginner, as I've only taken two CS classes. On top of this, I have such little knowledge that starting a decent personal project is near impossible so my resume is garbage.

3) Because I go to a shit-tier state school I have absolutely zero connections to any tech companies. I feel like going to the school I'm at is just going to lead me down the IT path and that just depresses me to hell because I really love coding.

So what do I do r/cscareerquestions? Do I go into debt and take an extra year at school to give me an extra summer for an internship opportunity, apply to internships for this summer even though I know I'll fall flat on my ass in a technical interview, or something else? I just need steps to follow to get me out of this rut and in a position that I can have a job when I graduate. Thanks to anyone who read this far!

TL;DR - Junior by credits, freshman by knowledge at a shit-tier state school. Not a lot of time left and need to get in the position to land an internship for next summer. Any advice is appreciated!"

The details aren't totally flushed out yet but the jist of it is that I won't be working on anything the company will use. 

Basically I work on a project the company gives me. Once a week I will go into the office for about five hours and be able to ask questions and ""shadow"" the other devs. Is this what an internship is like? I kind of expected more. The thing is, and I hope this doesn't come off as snobby but, I can teach myself to code . . . what I cannot teach myself is the experience of being in a web dev company. The inner workings of a company, chatting with clients(maybe just sitting in on meetings at this point), and working in a team etc. 

I have no experience in the industry. I am by no means a total beginner to coding however, and have a good grasp of: JavaScript and ES6, php/mySQL, and html5/css3. 

Edit: Forgot to mention I believe this is unpaid. They also have a management team who deals with clients as in the devs aren't involved in that process. The college set this up and it raises a few flags for me. I have to complete X many hours of internships to graduate."

I posted a similar thread in CSCareerQuestions a few days ago and got good responses over there, but I was interested in getting a viewpoint from the other side too.

In summary:
I'll be graduating college with a pretty strictly CS degree in Spring of 2018.  For relevant courses, I've taken data structures, algorithms, AI, automata theory, Calc III, and most likely probability.  I'll also most likely have some research under my belt in the form of a senior thesis, but I'm not sure yet on whether it will be relevant to finance (I don't really have an advisor available for that specific of a field at my college).  I don't think it's relevant, but I'll have an internship at BofA in a data oriented position (I don't have a specific project yet, but I've been told it will be in reference data technology).

My questions are as follows:

-What are some gaps in my education that I should fill before attempting to get a job in Quantitative finance?  Is it possible to self-study these areas, or would that be worthless as far as recruiters and companies are concerned.

-What types of jobs are available that fall under the umbrella of quant finance?  Broadly I can think of people who find patterns in the data, people who utilize the patterns,and high frequency trading ( I realize that these aren't necessarily exclusive to each other).  For what it's worth, the area of CS that interests me the most is pattern recognition in data and finding ways to utilize those patterns.

-What external sources do you recommend for 'getting into' the field?  Are there any textbooks to consider?  Or just general books to read?  What are the best journals I can find papers in to read?

Thanks!"

Finances:
First off I am a college student with an interest in pediatric robotic surgery; however, I come from a family who has been unemployed for longer than 13 months now, and I am out of state and have no money to pay for school. I am already working 2 jobs and applying to a crap ton of scholarships.

Matriculation:
I attend Virginia Tech as a Biochemistry (pre-med) major but since my family and I cannot afford the education (at this point I consider it an expensive brand which has the same experience as high school 2.0). I will have to pull out loans (which will add up to 100k). With my major, there is not that much flexibility I can do with Biochemistry. I took a career orientation class and an alumni came back to the school and said he was only making 35k after graduating. 

Overall, I do not like the school I am attending due to a number of factors:
1. Price
2. Education
-This is a research school-Not bad, but it limits the teaching capability
-You learn everything on your own
-You don't form a new perspective from the curriculum set forth
-It seems the administration is mostly concerned about adding infrastructure and a larger student population to increase revenue from tuition and fees
-Financial Aid is terrible-especially if you are out of state/international (its expensive)
-Un-diverse ethnically (at least the school is diverse politically)
-Hard to make friends since the majority of the students are either in-state Virginia residencies/grew up in the metro-DC area
I question my decision of matriculating here since I applied to 10 schools at once during high school and did well academically 
(finished with a 4.2 GPA, 4.6 GPA final semester by doing 34 college credit hours in one year of high school via dual enrollment) however, I was just pressed on time


What I am doing to help with the situation:
I am optimizing my time at the university by doing undergraduate research where I am in line for a publication, as a first author contributing to the field of robotic surgery. I will be going to an academic conference this coming year to present my research and network with people whoa re also contributing to the field as well. I am also networking with faculty to see if I could get my masters through an accelerated program in either biomedical engineering or industrial systems engineering. I have already took graduate classes in biomedical engineering, and have already did a sales internship last year, and am thinking of doing sales for a few years to have a lucrative option to pay off the 100k in debt)

Game Plans:

Option A:
-Be debt free from withdrawing from VT (but still keep the relationships with the faculty to be in line for publication (if possible))
-Move to an urban area in California or NYC
-Re-take the SAT, and apply to other prestigious schools (I did really well GPA wise in high school 
-Become a freshmen at a much more prestigious school
-Network with alumni/recruiters in either investment banking/consulting
-Have a lucrative career in an urban area with a higher income

Option B:
-Suck up the debt
-Try to get the masters through the accelerated program
-Work in pharmaceutical, medical device sales to stay relevant to my research/major, or a lucrative engineering field for a few years to save money for medical school
-Take the MCAT
-Apply to MD/PhD program (this program is debt free) (I will have industry experience and have masters anyway) 


Conclusion:
Which option do you think might work best? I do want to stick with medicine since I did 517 volunteer hours in a hospital in three years during high school, and do not want to give up the committed time. However, I need a lucrative career to be out of the financial situation. 

Any advice? Thank you for your help and time.

6dk3gy,3,2017-05-26,[Profile Review] Biotech and pharma - update (ECs and WE),biotechnicality,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/6dk3gy/profile_review_biotech_and_pharma_update_ecs_and/,"Hey guys,
I've come back with an updated profile review since things have changed quite drastically since last year;

I'm applying this cycle.
Please help me be a bit more realistic with my expectations:
Work experience (from most recent to oldest):

• Researcher (2 years) at current biotech startup. Company is in phase 3 clinical trials for our “Best in Class” drug and pending Discovery Candidate submission for a project I’ve helped to design (pre-clinical experimental stage). My work is primarily in R&amp;D where I’m responsible for carrying out key processes in the planning and execution of studies (data analysis, animal work, etc). Made improvements in protocol and methodology to increase efficacy/efficiency in labs. Originally my plan after joining was to try and branch out into other areas within the company (clinical, finance, etc.) to learn more about the biotech startup environment but as we’re expanding the opportunity and time to do so is dwindling. My focus is now shifted towards generating more data to partner with large pharm companies and proposing more DCs to push into clinical trials.

UPDATE since profile review (2016): After some of my old students began messaging me about STEM, I decided to start a mentorship/internship program at the company for current science students and/or career switchers who are interested in switching over to biotech from other fields. I’m currently training several students (college age) and career switchers (well beyond college age) in In Vivo techniques (animal studies- mainly rodents).
Program was greenlighted by C-level and sponsored by my company (thank goodness). Because this is a purely educational/training venture, I’m focusing a lot of the time on lab skills and physiology lessons for those non-science majors. 


• Contracted Researcher at a Big Pharma in a more limited and basic research role (6 months) before landing my current full-time job. I learned A LOT, but I’m not proud of how little time I spent here. The draw of job security with benefits was too much of an incentive to continue waiting for an open headcount – I was the 5th contractor in line to be hired on the team.


• Worked at a healthcare startup in San Francisco as a non-clinical (mostly back office) medical and coding technician. This was during the implementation of ICD10 codes (new billing codes) where I played a significant role in compliance and quality control in medical records. This job changed my career trajectory towards pursuing biotech instead of medicine (1 year).


• Post-graduation, I was hired as a research technician in the same lab where I completed my undergrad theses. I carried out experiments and I played a role in study design. I trained undergrads and mentored several interns interested in lab work. I also presented at several conferences, and published an abstract. (2 years)




Extracurricular activities:

• UPDATED since 2016: Became a board member of a national Women’s network in science. Now I’m assisting in putting on community chapter events and partnering with other chapters to build more programs targeting women in STEM. My big project: I am currently trying to build a mentorship program that connects 
Mentees to mentors and vice-versa. (2 years)

• Hobbies: photography (hosted solo exhibition in college) and submitted work for local competitions, triathlete in college (1 year) – looking to get back into training, former EMT-B

• College: Free dental clinic volunteer (&gt;1000hours), Muscular Dystrophy Association Camp Counselor, Reading tutor at Elementary school (work study)
Undergrad school/major:

• Went to a University of California – received B.S. in Neuroscience
Race/nationality: Asian American

Age: 26

Sex: Female

GMAT Score: 750

Undergrad GPA: 3.5

Goal of MBA: To switch careers. Immediately after obtaining my MBA I want to start working for a large pharmaceutical company (perhaps in a rotational program first then transitioning into a strategy role) where I can learn many different aspects of Big pharma. I want to pursue a tract towards becoming an executive or c-level. End game: I want build my own startups in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and biotech.
  

Target schools:
GSB, Wharton, HBS, Sloane, booth, Haas, Andersen, Tuck

I have basic networking knowledge (setting up modems and routers); basic hardware and software knowledge (helping troubleshoot/repair relatives computers); assisting with setting up computer lab for my local church (consisted of replacing HDDs, RAM, adding monitors and other peripherals.) I have done most of this over the last 5 months. 

I currently work security for my local transit authority and I have been networking with as many of the IT Managers and other IT personnel as I can. My name was brought up to one of the newer IT Managers and he wants to bring back an Internship program and asked me if I was interested and of course I said yes. He told me to get a resume together this weekend and have it back to him after the holidays. My concern is making my resume catch their attentions with only the little bit of experience that I have. I have worked in the food industry for about 8 years (before, during, and after college), I have interned with a local police department, Vice President of Criminal Justice student organization, studying for A+ Cert, all the above mentioned experience... How can I make all this work on my resume?

6dkiq8,8,2017-05-26,Feedback on job offers,financeguy22,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/6dkiq8/feedback_on_job_offers/,"Hi everyone! Thanks in advance for the help. I graduated last December from a non-target state school with a degree in finance. 

I luckily networked my way to an internship at a boutique private equity company and was offered to stay on after graduating. My role with the company is specifically on origination and no actual modeling related roles (which sucks). I make 50k in a low cost of living area.

I have recently been offered an entry level credit analyst position in one of the big banks wholesale middle marking banking division. Pretty easily defined role and I'm sure everyone knows about this kind of a role. Don't have the final offer yet but it's in the same low cost of living area and is supposed to be ""little more"" than my current salary according to HR.

The dilemma is the PE company is relatively new and the team is very small and unorganized. The big bank is obviously much more structured and has a very successful analyst program. Don't really know what my long term career is going to look like and I may very well have to rebrand myself (MBA?). 

My questions are 

1) which one sounds more attractive to you and why?
2) Does anyone know if the big bank has any wiggle room on salary or are they very much set in stone?


Thanks!

It was a design engineer offer that resulted from my internship with the company last summer.  At the time, I enjoyed working with the team and it seemed like a great opportunity to relocate to SoCal.

Fast forward to now, after four months of working full time, I am miserable.  The optimistic start-up from last summer now feels like a sinking ship.  Our product isn’t meeting industry requirements and critical deadlines are being pushed back by months.  It feels like we are just scrambling around while more problems pop up every week.  

At this point, I am mentally and physically exhausted.  I feel like I have no control over my life anymore.  My hair has been turning gray and I started dying it this month.   Working 60-70 hours a week without overtime pay is pretty much expected out of us now.  My salary at 60k is on the lower end as well (IMO) so that makes me feel worse.  I feel that there is a distinct separation between management and the engineers where my time and effort are taken for granted.  

In the past month, three of the nine design engineers have quit.  My entry to mid level coworkers are all talking about next opportunities and interviewing.  I don’t don’t see myself staying much longer but what are my options?  I imagine that looking for a new job after less than half a year of employment doesn’t reflect well.  

- Is it reasonable to start looking and apply to other jobs now/soon?
- Is there a minimum amount of time I have to stay despite being miserable?
- Would my ongoing masters program negatively impact my employability?
- Do I need to change my perspective?

I really want to prove myself in the workforce but I feel like I'm in a hole and its affecting my wellbeing.  What can I do...

A little background about me. I graduated back in end of 2015. Self-taught myself software development for 5 month, landed an internship in Software Engineering. Internship duration was from June - August 2016. Afterwards, I was unemployed for a year. Then now I recently landed another internship and this company might hire me after 2-3 month of me interning. 

I am stuck with a decision of either going to a 2nd internship or a coding bootcamp. I was admitted to a very well known coding bootcamp in San Francisco called Hack Reactor. I can either attend the bootcamp and try to find a job again or attend the internship and if I get a full-time then maybe I will stay depending on how well the pay is. If it is bad, then I can attend the coding bootcamp after my internship. 

I am slightly leaning towards the bootcamp more because I feel like interning will be kind of wasting my time at this point. I have two friends who have done App Academy, which is another top-tier coding bootcamp in San Francisco and landed over $100K.

I have two options:
A) Attend a coding bootcamp right away and try to land a well paying job in San Francisco?
B)Go to the internship and get underpaid for 3 months and then try to see if I get a full-time position. If I fail to get a full-time position or the full-time position does not pay as much as I thought, I will attend the bootcamp."

I'm 21 years old, and I've finished my junior year of college. I've been home for at least a week now, and I've spent most of my time relaxing and not doing much. I like the free time that I've had so far, and I appreciate the fact that I can finally rest for a little bit and not worry about school. Additionally, I have an internship for the summer. 

However,  my relationship with my family isn't very good. Going to college has taught me a lot about myself &amp; who I am, and junior year in particular has made me think a lot about how I interact with my family. I feel like an outcast at times, since I don't really spend much time with my family. I'm into more creative things such as writing, music &amp; poetry, whereas my family members just like to watch TV most of the time. I feel like my family &amp; I don't have much in common, and I don't share that many interests with them. 

Also, I feel as though the connection with my family is sort of missing. My brother (21/M) doesn't open up to me, and I can't really connect with him because he keeps a lot to himself and our personalities don't really match up. My sister (23/F) never talks to me these days, and I have to be one that initiates contact with her. My sister doesn't put in the effort with our relationship, and my dad is aggressive &amp; has a short fuse. My mother is the only person that I have a connection with. 

Also, I don't really talk to my high school friends, and we've sort of drifted away over time. I rarely see my high school friends these days, and my college friends live way too far way from me. On the other hand, my brother still hangs out with his high school friends, and his high school friends went to my brother's college. It seems like my brother is more social than me, especially because he has a girlfriend &amp; he leaves the house more than I do. Furthermore, I have autism, so that affects things even more in my case. 

In the meantime, I've tried to focus more on myself and being content with who I am, and I want to devote some time to my hobbies. I was wondering if anybody else has dealt with this, and what I should do about this. "
6dmdne,2,2017-05-27,Possibility to become department head. Opinions?,hubbabubbathrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6dmdne/possibility_to_become_department_head_opinions/,"So I'm 38 now, programming since 8 or 9 yo, professional developer all my life, 6 years in my current company. When it comes to programming and architecture, I can say without arrogance I'm the most experienced guy in the company. Approaching 30 programming languages, learning new frameworks and tools by the month. I love programming. Now there's an open position for department head, and based on my experience, I've been asked how I feel about it. I told them I'd come back after having a few days to think it through.

So there is a team of about 10 developers, each with their own specialties, but they don't exactly write *good* code. From the human point of view I get along with most of them, two of them would readily accept me as a boss, the others are usually quick to fall in line. Two of them are know-it-alls and try to push their way through everything. My experience with leading people so far: Apart from guiding / mentoring a few interns, zilch.

Now I'm thinking. Becoming a department head is not exactly something you can just step down from after a few weeks if it's not to your liking. I would stop being ""just"" a developer for the rest of my life. I get along with my would-be bosses, who would mentor me into the new position, but so far I don't know what to expect. From a purely technical side I'm confident. If I wanted to e.g. introduce them to ""advanced"" version control (git instead of cvs), I could get hem on boat just by showing them concrete advantages, not by passing down commands. With the two know-it-alls... I think I'd let them know I appreciate the fields they really are good at (and I'm not), and take their voices seriously as an expert opinion, as long as they don't cause me any trouble (expressed in nicer words, heh). There are *lots* of ideas running around in my head already when it comes to improving the current process, advancing their capabilities and so on. I'd take it slowly, one step at a time, so they can see *why* I want them to stop duplicating code, not just do it because bossman told them to. But I wouldn't be able to write as much code anymore, there would be more meetings with the higher ups, more time filled with other stuff.

Has anyone here been in a similar spot? This could be a big milestone in my life, could turn out good or bad. On the other hand, if I do nothing, I stay ""just"" a programmer, which could turn out to be a problem with employability in the future. In Germany, there is much less ageism in IT, but still... In the end, it's a decision I have to make for myself, but what's your take on this?

Topped until 10th. Went downhill from there when I joined a college which had relaxed attendance. It also didn't help that my college was situated far away in a remote village, which made me skip most of the classes. 

I just became more lazy, and had a YD(Year Down) after my Second Year(SY) of BSc(Comp.Sci). Somehow cleared all the backlogs and got admission for TY. Then, I had to stay alone for a long time at home, and suddenly with all the new responsibilities, I was overwhelmed. It became hard to sleep enough, wake up at time and attend lectures. I got frustrated with how much workload I suddenly had. 

Now, my results were declared today; YD again, with 3 backlogs!! 


My health was also an issue, as I had high fever and a myriad of problems just before the exams.


Expecting the YD, I started taking shit seriously and practised coding, starting from the basics. Originally, I wanted to be a game programmer, but after my CS project in TY, I felt like my interest deviated more toward web dev. So started it from scratch again, and learnt HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, PostgreSQL, mySQL, Python, Ruby etc through an online course. Currently focusing on making my shitty CS project(online shopping portal) look clean and beautiful. I registered on internshala and other couple of sites for an internship and also made a linkedin and github profile.


I always loved coding, and obviously topped in the programming subjects in all the academic years. I hated Electronics and other shit they piled up in my BCs course.



Anyways, I'm pretty confident that I'll clear these backlogs now as I have plenty of time to study for the October exams. 
Also, in these 5-6 months, I aim to build web dev based projects from scratch. 


But, now my question is, should I go for MCs after I clear my backs? Also, will doing an internship in October(after I give my backlog exams) help with getting a job later? Or is interning pointless? Will the employers just reject me for having 2 YD's?
I feel shitty and anxious right now, not knowing wtf I should do."
6do4jo,3,2017-05-27,Silhouettes and Choking - 1,hyde93,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6do4jo/silhouettes_and_choking_1/,"Hi all. I had posted the other day the story of the my acquaitance whom I may or may not have imagined seeing in my room 5 years ago (this one- ""What i saw in my room"").
In my life, consciously and in the first-person perspective, I've had three such unexplainable and/or paranormal experience, the first one being what I have already shared here. My family recount a few experiences which I have forgotten, nonetheless I'll be talking about them too soon.

What I'm about to tell you is the second of those experiences, not in the chronological order of the said experiences. This happened to me last year, when I had been to Buffalo.

As part of a short term exchange program, I had been to the University at Buffalo (SUNY) in June of 2016, along with 65 other classmates. A month-long venture, it was spread throughout June so we knew that it's smack in the middle of the summer break, or so I interpret (let me know if I'm wrong about it). This meant that the campus would be largely empty, barring a few people scattered throughout the north campus. For us Indians who were getting done with our internships during the summer break over here (April-May), it did make us feel a little out of sorts. 
So by the end of the first week of june, we had been settled into a co-ed dorm complex called Ellicott Complex for the next three weeks. 

By the end of that week, we got to know of a few campus stories about campus violence and even murders and bloodshed in the North campus, concerning a racial attack and a subsequent feud a few years ago. Now for a group of people who were the ethical minority at that time, a few of the docile members of my group felt uneasy about it. This feeling escalated over the week as jet lag kicked in and our nearly round-the-clock schedule hardly gave us any amount of decent rest (to be exact, 1-2 hours of sleep in 24 hours). Piles of case studies and group assignments only made the general predicament even worse. 

It didn't take long for the few of the foolhardy folks in my group so start spouting ghost stories and stuff about the complex because, hey, that's what Hollywood does to you- excitedly expect a Valak nun in the cupboards or some slimy moths and black cracks in the wall or something. While that freaked out some of the most devout and belief-wise sensitive people in the group, they didn't know that I had experienced something in that whole time. 

That something was two occurrences, both of which occurred in my room. 
The first was on a Thursday afternoon, when I was back in my room and my roommate was out, roaming the campus. I was at the study desk and was resting my head on the desk and looking at the wardrobes. Now the wardrobes were next to the door of the room, covering the length of the wall. The desk I was sitting on was in front of a window. So, as I was looking at the wardrobe doors and contemplating sleep, something moved on it. It was the silhouette of a man, its black figure sliding across surface of the wardrobe doors for about a 3-4 seconds before fading away. I remember the edges of the silhouette reminding me of a man in the dress of a catholic monk or a friar, specifically the image of Hugh Jackman's sidekick in his Van Helsing movie. 
Now since i was facing the wardrobe with the window behind me, you'd expect that it was the shadow of someone across the window. I thought so too, until i realised in a split second that my room was on the first floor of the dorm and there was a tree blocking the window so no man could stand there and move like that. Also the window  was an East-facing one  and it was late afternoon or early evening and the light​ of the sun was diffused and directed towards the floor, so there was no way any shadow could have formed on the wardrobe. Besides the shadow was too sharp to be possible in such light. And i had not switched on any lights in the room.

I thought that through in moments after the silhouette happened, when a girl from the next room passed by the door, before realising that I was there and she walked in towards me. We chatted for a while, my attention being on the wardrobe the whole time, half-expecting for whatever-it-was to show up again. My friend perceived my distracted mind as tiredness and so she excused herself out of the room. But as she reached the threshold, she quickly spun around and looked at something on the blindside of the desk. 

""Why is that chair moving?"" She asked.

Confused, I craned my neck over to see the semi-rocking chair gently rocking back and forth. I didn't want to the assume the paranormal-kind obvious and said, ""probably you hit it on your way out or your skirt must have hit it or it must have got pushed by the draft in your wake.""

""Dude, none of that is possible. It's nowhere in the space between me and you right now.""

She was right, the chair was too far from any physical stimulus to initiate such a movement. It moved gently but constantly and consistently, as though someone was moving it steadily. 

That incident was enough to​ turn my room into a mini Haunted destination for the rest of my group, who came to oggle at the now-still chair and be afraid for me. Of course i hadn't told them about the silhouette so that I wouldn't start a panic, because there were people who were asking ""where in Buffalo can we find a Hindu priest for blessing and exorcising this room?"" I could do well without that grief.

Although what happened a few days afterwards did make me consider the priest option too. 

I shall tell you all of the follow up to this soon. "

6doomg,1,2017-05-27,Stay on at current internship for the fall semester or take interesting classes?,pompandcats,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6doomg/stay_on_at_current_internship_for_the_fall/,"Background: I'm doing a second bachelor's degree in CS at a no-name university in Canada. I only started the program last year, but I had a ton of transferred electives so I actually only need to take roughly one more semester of coursework to finish and graduate. I'm currently on an internship at a good but not-very-prestigious company.

My manager has offered to extend my internship into the fall semester. But I'm not sure that this would be worth doing, because I don't feel like I'm learning that much here. I've mostly been fixing bugs for the past month and there have been entire days where I've had literally nothing to do. The team I'm on just doesn't seem to have that much work to go around. But the pay is good and the people are nice. If I stayed on, I'd be able to graduate in April with 8 months of work experience under my belt.

OTOH if I went back to studying, I could take some really interesting, advanced CS courses (algorithms, distributed computing, cryptography, neural networks, etc.). This is the kind of subject matter that I likely would never learn on the job, and it's pretty much my last opportunity to take them since most of them are usually only offered in the fall (the winter semester offerings aren't as good imo). I'm honestly more excited for these classes than for the internship. I'm also interested in doing a coursework-based Master's so I can get an even more rigorous grounding in CS and possibly get the name of a more reputable school on my resume. So, taking these classes could improve my chances of being admitted. The downside here is that I'd be graduating as early as this December, and I've only had this one 4-month internship. I don't know feel if I feel ready for the job market in the event that I don't make it into a Master's program.

Also, my manager has asked me to make my decision by Monday, so I need some advice fast!


tl;dr: Should I stay on at a boring internship and graduate with more work experience, or take more interesting/challenging CS coursework?

Sidenote (in case anyone brings it up): the cost of tuition isn't really a concern for me because the Ontario government offers nearly-free tuition, plus i'll probably be getting a scholarship from my university and I can probably get a TAship too. But of course, I'd have way more money if I did the internship instead."
6dovol,1,2017-05-27,Taking an extra term to graduate for another internship,cthrows6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6dovol/taking_an_extra_term_to_graduate_for_another/,"First off, I know this is the cliche of the entire subreddit, but I really want to work at a top tech company (Big 4 or equivalent with similar salary and reputation) after I graduate. **TLDR is at the bottom**

I'm scheduled to graduate May 2018, but I don't feel confident in my ability to land a top tech job. I tried applying for the Big 4 and other top internships this summer, but didn't even make it past the resume screening. I'm also weak at coding interviews, and I'm doing leetcode every day to try and remedy that, but don't think I'll be good enough by this September to get a new grad Big 4 job, if I even get the interview that is.

So I'm thinking of delaying my graduation by 1 term (graduate in December 2018 instead) so that I can take another shot at getting a good internship. The reason why I want to do this is so that if I fail to get the internship for May 2018, then I can try improving myself again and then shooting for a full-time position when I graduate in December 2018.

On the other hand, if I graduate on time in May 2018 and fail to get a new grad position at the Big 4, I'll have to work at another company for at least a year before trying again. The way I see it, taking an extra 4 months to graduate could save me a year of time if I can get the job I want right away. I also think interviewing for FT position while at a FT job will be very difficult.

Here is a summary of where I am right now:

- Going into senior year at a target school (It's not top 10 or even top 20, but the Big 4 come to our career fairs). GPA is &gt; 3.0
- Will have had 2 Software Engineering internships by the end of this summer at tech companies that are known, but not prestigious.
- Side projects are a bit lacking: 1 medium-sized app, 1 really small and boring CRUD application, and a class project. *I will try to work on at least 1 more project this summer though*

**TLDR: Typical CSCQ kid who is obsessed with landing a Big 4 or equivalent job after graduation (May 2018). Have 2 internships, but neither are top tech internships. I'm not feeling confident in my abilities to get the interview or pass the interview for new grad positions so I want to delay graduation by 4 months (December 2018) to take a shot at a Big 4 internship before trying for a Big 4 full-time position. Is this a bad idea?**

I'm often too lazy to add them because I don't want the hassle of deleting them later. But if there was an app that I could define certain contacts to be deleted after a set amount of time (ex: 3 month of internship), then that would be awesome. Or an app that would automatically delete contacts that you have not called nor texted over the past few years (it would ask you before deleting them to confirm), etc.

What do you guys think?"

Take a couple classes that scare you or are hard to build your ability to get shit done

Research is just as important as internships.

General Advice

  - Research professors, especially ones teaching classes you're in, figure out what they're doing
  - Talk to them about what they do
  - Ask if they have any open research positions or know any other professors which do
The only important thing to think about in internships and research is what you will actually be doing.
Also how much mentorship you get.
Only cheat on homework when you don't want to learn how to do what you're doing e.g. the work is repetitive.
The best textbook strategy I've found is to get an ebook from libgen and get an international version of the textbook from amazon
  - Download ebook for each class so you can Ctrl-F. Also look for a solutions manual
  - Get the actual book for reading for long periods. Give these away to somebody else if you don't think you'll need them

  - Houses are superior for living
   - cheap
   - you get to meet a lot of people
   - you don't have to worry about CA's RA's or police
   - If you don't like something, you are more able to change it
   - Parties
   - You end up feeling safer in CP
  - Bikes are superior for transportation
   - exercise, go anywhere you need to go easily
   - quicker to get to class
  - Most people aren't happy they took lots of credits in one very specific area - diversify and get a minor
  - Join at least one club to dedicate a bunch of time too
   - Good for meeting people
   - Good for building hobbies up for after college

CS Advice:

Your main choices for good prospects are CS/Math - CS/Research - CE - EE - Build your own major

Out of these, I'd say CS/Math is best for high paying jobs, CE is best for govt

DONT take Software Engineering, possibly ML and AI. Instead, take 439M ML

DO take Networks, Algorithms, possibly Databases

Try to place out of as many courses as possible in the beginning if you can, you'll learn the material eventually anyways. 

EASIEST CS classes

HARDEST CS classes

Remember that the resume you build in college is primarily useful for getting that first job, so think about exactly what kind of job you want and build a resume respectively

This means

Grad school - Max Research and then GPA. Figure out who to get 3 letters of rec from EARLY ON. Do research BEFORE your senior year. 

Big 6 - Get good at algorithms, chill out, study for interviews 6 months before being done with college. 

Medium and Small companies - Max projects, TA, research, interviews, min GPA

Govt - Math, research, GPA

DONT pull all-nighters, theyre never necessary

DONT complain, stress, and brag about how much work you have, how hard you have it. There's probably a way to eek out more useful time out of your day.

A recommendation to maximize most useful study time in a day is to study for a 4 hour block on wakeup, 4 hour block before sleep

figure out what a pomodoro is and if it's right for you

Learn Linux/Unix commandline and tools WELL, and learn vim or emacs at least passably.

Learn git well.

Try out career-oriented clubs, see if you like it. This includes UMD Robotics, cybersecurity club, TerpRacing, TerpHackers

The three main hackerspaces on campus are Startup Shell, Sandbox, and Collider. Check them all out, they're all pretty cool

Try out hackathons, see if you like them

Try out office hours if you learn that way.

Good luck :)"

So I have to choose between:

1. An Engineering internship in HVAC where I have to work 730-430 five days a week with a 30 minute commute. Meaning I am pretty much devoting 10-11hours/day to my work. This is a respectable job and pays pretty well but the work is repetitive and the days are long.

2. A programming job where I will learn Python programming language, however, the pay and hours are less. Only 25/hrs a week but I have no commute. I would probably pick up a another job as well for 10/hrs a week. Meaning a combined 35hr/wk. This will open up my schedule significantly and I will actually be able to enjoy this summer, hang out with friends etc etc. However, this job requires me to commit during the semester as well (Which I am already pretty busy with a lot of project).


I want to be able to enjoy this beautiful island but I also want to be financially comfortable. Anybody out their that is able to find time in the day to do things while devoting 40-50hr/wk to your job?  "

I had an interview for an internship last week. I didn't feel it went well, but I managed to get to the second (and final) round of interviews. However, I am not sure how to prepare properly.

The first interview was around hour and fifteen minutes long and included a lot of very theoretical questions as I would call them. It started off with some questions like ""what is inside the computer?"", then some questions about processor and caches and then we moved on to data structures, but ""with caches in mind"". I was then asked a few theoretical questions about linked lists and arrays, time complexity of certain methods and then about ""why are arrays better in real world"" which of course had to do with caches and the rule of locality. This part took around 40 minutes and then we went on to talk about programming languages in general - ""why did people move from procedural to oo programming?"", ""what is the use of private and protected keywords?"" etc.

As I said, I didn't feel good about my performance in the first interview. Therefore I would like to do some studying/research before the second one (as I would really like to get this internship).

* Very minimal experience with python and linux
* Built and diagnosed/ fixed PC's
*Lots of service hours
* Avid member in extracurricular activities (band, GSA, theater)
* Lots of experience of working with people (current job)

So I think I might be getting my internship offer rescinded due to poor communication on the company's end, specifically the recruiter.  Quick timeline of events:

**Early April:** Interview with the company. Got my resume through because I had a contact at the company.

**May 5th**: Voicemail from recruiter saying they're offering me the internship. Salary is lower than I asked for, so I send an email asking for a raise/a few other questions I had about the role. Recruiter doesn't respond to any of my emails or phone calls.

**May 9th**: I hear back about my questions from my contact at the company. No contact from the recruiter. My contact forwards me the information of my future manager, and I send him an email with my questions.

**May 15th**: I hear back about my questions from my contact at the company. I ask for 1.5 weeks to make a decision (I told them I would get back to them by May 24th). My contact confirms that's fine.

**May 24th**: I accept the offer to intern. Future manager emails me saying he's excited for me to join the team, and cc's the recruiter to get the paperwork started.

**May 26th**: Get a voicemail from the recruiter that ""there was some miscommunication on her end regarding the internship"" and she wants to chat ""to see where my head's at"". 

I set up a time to call her next week, but I'm concerned that this recruiter messed up and offered the position to someone else (or there is some sort of error on her part).

If it is indeed the case the recruiter messed up and my offer is no longer valid, what steps should I take? After I got the offer I stopped applying to other positions, and with just a few weeks until the summer starts, I don't have any leads for any other positions. Any advice on how I should approach my phone call with the recruiter if my assumptions are indeed correct?

I have a bit of a dilemma. In short, I'm really unhappy living where I am (far from home) and want to move to a specific city (near my hometown, near family and friends, where I went to college, where I consider ""home""). The only problem is that there aren't many jobs in my field that I'm interested in in that area. Am I crazy to consider switching to a career in a different field just to live where I want to live? And have you ever heard of a Mechanical Engineer switching to work in Software/Coding (I have some past experience).


The longer version:

I majored in mechanical engineering in college. I'm from the Midwest, and most of the ME jobs there dealt with automotive, HVAC, manufacturing, stuff like that. I had three different internships in college. The first was working for a company in my hometown which, among other things, makes software and data analysis tools. While there I worked in software engineering, learned a new language, and worked mostly on debugging and code maintenance, but I had a few side projects for my own development. I enjoyed working in software, even as a mechanical engineer, but wanted to get some experience in my own field. The next summer I worked for an industrial ventilation company doing a lot of drafting, data analysis, and whatever other grunt work needed done. I liked the work alright, but wanted to try getting out of my comfort zone and wanted to try working in oil and gas (mainly to make more money). So the next summer I moved to the Gulf Coast and worked in a plant for a company that makes oilfield equipment. I enjoyed the work and liked the industry a lot. My only hesitation was that I didn't really like living that far from home. I eventually decided it was worth it, and upon graduation moved to Texas to work for the same company in their corporate office.

About a month after moving down, I started to have second thoughts. A few months later, I started interviewing for other jobs back home. I ended up getting a few offers, but none of them were jobs that really interested me. Also they all had lower salaries than I had been offered right out of school the year before for similar jobs in the same area. So about a year ago, I gave up looking, and decided to just press on down here. I actually do enjoy my job. It's not perfect, but I have good coworkers, a decent manager, fairly interesting work, and a pretty fair compensation package. The thing is, I'm just very unhappy living here. I miss my family, my friends, my home. I really want to move back. Over the past few months I've been playing around with coding, learning some web development and JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp.com and messing around with my Arduino. It got me thinking about trying to get back into software. It's not that I don't like the line of work I'm in now, it's just that it's very difficult to find similar jobs to it back home. Am I crazy for considering switching my career just to live where I want to live?"

In the fall, I'm going to enter my senior year at college.  Assuming my internship this summer doesn't convert to a full time offer, when should I begin sending out resumes for a full time position, preferably so I can jump right into work as soon as Spring 2018 rolls by?  For what it's worth, the caliber of companies I'm aiming for is competitive (I think something like one of the big N would be a stretch, but not by much.  The only reason I'm including this bit is because I imagine more competitive companies expect incoming devs to apply earlier than less competitive ones).  If geographical location makes any difference, I'm pretty much restricted to the NYC area (at least for the first year).

In addition, should I be applying for internships as well?  I assume yes because it can't hurt and if I get a part-time job that starts in Fall 2018 I might as well spend the Summer 2018 doing something.

Also (if somewhat irrelevant) what is the general feeling among companies that don't have any kind of education reimbursement policies having their employees in a graduate program part time?  I would like to at least get a masters within a few years after graduating, but don't know if I should restrict my job search to just companies that actively support it.

Thanks"

I'm a rising senior in college, and I'll be starting a summer internship in a week. I'll be at an medium-sized investment bank in NYC, working in their credit risk management group, mostly focusing on DCM transactions and risk surrounding debt issuances.

I have a pretty good idea of what 'credit risk' is on a general level, but what should I expect on a day-to-day basis? Speaking with some of the people in the group, they say the work varies a lot depending on what other teams need, so I don't fully know what to expect.

They also begin with a 1-week orientation/training and pair your with a mentor, but is there anything I should focus on and prepare before I start? Brush up on specifics of Excel, focus on better understanding financial statements?

Any advice or insight would be really appreciated.

Thanks!

MIT is my ""reach"" school, but I feel fairly confident that I could get into E-R based on what they said when I toured there.  I recently realized what a good deal Stanford is (I'd qualify for free tuition), but I'm right under the curve as far as GPA and ACT scores are concerned.  I am looking into other schools such as the Univ. of Alabama in Huntsville, Virginia Tech and Purdue, but I feel that I could get into those more easily(?).

**Demographics:** Caucasian, Male, Straight, don't expect much in the way of scholarships ;)

**Intended Major:** Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering

**Academics:**  
GPA: 4.0  
SAT: 1420 (Math 660, English 760)  
ACT: 31 (28 Math, 34 Science, 27 English, 34 Reading)

**Questions:**  
- If you take the ACT, do you still need the SAT subject tests in order to get into MIT?  
- Many schools say that they recommend three years of the same foreign language, will I be at a significant disadvantage by taking two years each of two languages?  
- ~~When I toured Embry Riddle, the admissions counselor said that he likes applications that stick out among the crowd (I assume most schools are like that).  I had the idea of having my friends and I (the ones who do the weather balloons) write each other recommendation letters, in order to stand out.  Of course, we'd also have ""real"" rec letters, but do you think this is a good idea?~~  
- I would like a college that has good opportunities for internships (I know that Stanford has lots of SpaceX interns for example; I want to work for SpaceX eventually).  
- One big point of debate for me is cost vs. quality of education.  I could easily get free tuition at UAH for example, but it is not nearly as good as MIT or even E-R.

- I went to a ~~pretty~~ really bad charter school for my Freshman year; I think that this really put a damper on what I thought I could do, and I didn't really get into my groove until Junior year.

So, hello, I am a 21 year old guy from Europe who was studying Computer science (AP program) in Denmark, Aalborg to be exact. During my years at the college/university I learned about databases, general development process, looked into Open source systems and had c# classes. My college/university is not among the top one, but this general course gave me a solid ground to land a perfect internship and learn much more. After internship my studies were postponed until 2017 September, I applied for the Web development course. After finding out that I have more than half of year off the college/university, I started to work as a backend developer for the same internship company. I started from the February and I learnt a lot until now, futhermore, I am a valuable employee at the company, they created a new team, which I am a part of now and I get to work with not the biggest clients, but still, descent ones. They raised my sallary 2 times already. I cannot be any happier and I love my job, everything is perfect, the problem is my upcoming studies from the September. My boss is telling me that I should just quit university and stay with my half of bachelor degree and continue working, he would rather spend some money on me going to conferences and learning things. 

This company is international one and as far as I know, more experienced developers are getting one of the highest salaries in the country, so it is not some kind of start-up or shady one time thing.

The problem is that I want to obtain bachelor degree just so I could put a ""+"" in my life achievements list- I want to have a degree. On the other hand, I cannot see a point of going back to studying as it will take 1,5 additional years that will cost me money (accomodation, food, etc.), also they will be teaching us something in the lines between ""Jquery, css and 1 js framework"" which seems like a complete waste of time for me personaly, Im already quite good at these things, although I am backend, I often get some easier frontend tasks, and I assume, I know more than college can teach me.  

I had this discussion with my parents, but they have strict oppinion on having a bachelor degree or even masters, so they would prefer me to get a paper, despite the fact I will be going down-hill for 1,5 years. I completely understand their concerns about my future and that they want the best for me, but I cannot aggree with them 100%, im no expert, but I already noticed that being developer is more about your previous work and skill set and not about diploma (might be exceptions for the bigger companies). 

**TL;DR** Choosing between studies that will not benefit me at all academics wise, and having half diploma with quite big perspectives as a backend developer at company I've been working for nearly half a year.

Can I get an advice with couple valid points on why I should go and finish college or in contriversy, why I should just quit college and start working on my career and the company?"
6dv5nj,4,2017-05-28,Should I change schools jump from Aerospace Engineering to becoming a technologist due to my GPA?,supernintendan64,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6dv5nj/should_i_change_schools_jump_from_aerospace/,"It's a bit of a read but I needs some advice...


So I'm in a bit of a stressful decision that needs to be made soon. I'm currently an Aerospace Engineering student at the University at Buffalo. My first year went pretty well however things went downhill my 3rd semester with my semester technical GPA sinking from a 3.0 into a 1.8... I was put on academic warning which is just a step away from academic probation which would servery limit what I can do in the university and rule out most possibilities to transferring. I've wanted to be an aerospace engineer for over a decade since I was young (i'm currently 19). The problem is that if my GPA goes any lower I run the possibility of getting kicked out of the school of engineering and end up having to go somewhere else. My backup plan was to transfer out of UB and head over to Buffalo State which is a smaller less renowned school to do Mechanical Engineering Technology and become a technologist. While this is a bit of a let down it feels like its a safer path to take with less risks of loosing a lot.  There are some perks to doing this switch. The major advantage is since the rigor or Buffalo State is less then UB, my current school, I would actually be a bit ahead with some junior classes already completed since I had to do them in my sophomore yeah at UB. Also the amount of credits required for a technologist degree is 120 while the aerospace engineering degree required 134! and they expect students to do this in 4 years. Since Buffalo State would only require 120 credits to graduate with the technologist degree I could theoretically work part time and try to get some work experience in the industry as an intern which I feel is vital for job interviews. It also seems that at this point to get my Aerospace Engineering degree at UB would take 5 years since I had to retake classes but at Buffalo State I could still finish in 4 years and spend that 5th year working on an MBA. Buffalo State is only 20 minutes from UB so I would be loosing my friends which is good.

So that's my story so what I'm curious to hear is what you guys would do in a situation like this. I've given this a lot of thought but it would be nice to hear what other engineers think.

Would you change schools/major to clear a bad GPA to help with getting an internship and have more time to work in an internship and possibly be a little happier and less stressed? 

Thanks for your time in reading this. I really appreciate it

My first internship will take place in fall 2018, after 3 years in university. I would like to get a software engineering internship in a good company in the Valley, like Apple (where a few students  of my school got internships) or Microsoft etc... I did a few research and saw that doing a lot of projects is essential to be an intern in such companies. But here in France engineering studies are almost completely focused on theory, which brings two problems :
- You don't do much school projects : so far, after 2 years of study, my only school project is an instagram-like website with a PostgreSQL database 
- You can't do a lot of projects on your own outside of school, because studying theoritical courses takes way too much time (I barely have enough time to do a bit of sport (Taekwondo) and cook)

I'm currently working on an Android app with Bluetooth functionality, and I will try to work on other projects when I'll have ideas. I've studied 5 languages, and I'm fluent in French and English, have an intermediate level in German and a basic level in Arabic and Japanese. I'm interested in data science and would like to become a data scientist when I graduate (even if I can't do my first internship in his field, as it requires skills I don't have yet)

What should I do to improve my chances of getting an internship in a big company in the silicon valley ? Will it be a problem if I have less projects on my resume than students from other countries ?

I don't want to feel so angry against my parents. Would a psychologist help me figure out the reasoning behind this way? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's a little background just incase there is anyone out there that notices something I'm missing. I'll break up the timeframes by schooling level.

Grade School:
My parents had a pretty violent divorce when I was 5. We would all spend holidays together after that but arguing and fighting would always ensue. My parents would always talk shit about the other to my brother and I. My mom would try to convince us my dad was evil and my dad would try to convince us of the same for my mom. We also lived with our mom after the divorce and moved to a different state. We'd see our dad only in the summer usually. 

High school:
I was kind of a jock playing football. Neither of my parents ever saw one of my games even though I made varsity my sophmore year. In my junior/senior year I started smoking weed/partying and I was pretty open about it too since I lived in california and the smoking weed part was legal since I had my medical marijuana card. Still though, right before I graduated high school and went off to college, my mom called the cops on me and tried to get a restraining order against me. Cops told her she can't kick me out the house b.c that was my residence. They couldn't arrest me b.c I did nothing illegal. Also, I never got physical with her either so the restraining order request was a joke to the officer. My mom just had huge issue with me smoking weed even though I was taking care of my academics.

college: 
I barley see them really. I do keep them updated with my successes and achievements whether it be a really good internship I got or if I made dean's list. When I'm with them though my mom and dad imply a lot that they're responsible for anything good that happens to me.

today:
Idk, at this point my relationship with them is fine and the fighting almost never happens anymore. I feel like everyone has just matured over time. Yet, I still feel angry inside when I think about them. Its at a point where it bothers me.

Any feedback would be cool."

I'm basically done with my first internship- I'm about to get my reference letter in- and I worked unpaid. I worked for a website internship and my boss's aide told me about another internship opportunity from the company that my boss got his previous website from. 

Now, I'm not sure if I'd like to take up on this offer. I'm going to do Computer Science in college but I'm not sure if I enjoy the computer programming aspect or the web development aspect of the field. 

I can't say I'm even an expert in web development, but I'm not sure if the company would teach me on the job. 

 Of course, more work experience looks good. I've had zero work experience before the first internship but I had that backed up by grades/community service.

-
Yesterday I was relaxing at home, hungover and, for some reason in an introspective mood.  The night before I went out on a shitty tinder date with some girl that I almost immediately knew I had no real interest in.  But still, I went back to hers, did the quick and dirty and then left to meet up with a couple friends to go out drinking for the night (Friday's have become somewhat of a ritual for us lately).  And next morning, in that state of being hungover, I felt a that aforementioned sense of introspection (i.e. ""what am I doing with my life?"") creep up on me.

--
Facilitatingly (to my mind-state) enough, lazily cruising the internet, as one does the next morning, I stumbled upon a video posted by an old acquaintance on my Facebook mini-feed.  It was a commencement speech.  But the speaker wasn't Will Ferrell or Matthew McConaughey.  It was some random you-tuber who I've never heard of, called Wong Fu Productions.  The speech was raw and real and connected with me in a very real way (link:  https://youtu.be/H5k9T12b9bs?t=4m17s).  It was centered around what you should expect to experience throughout your 20s and boiled down to two main points.

--
In your 20s everyone talks about and searches for: 

--
1) Finding out what you really want to do
2) Relationships

--
It went through the ideas that nobody truely knows the answer to the former and that you will do things you hate and things you love, but the point is to follow those urges of passion; and that love is about finding yourself, being with someone that will push you to be your best self and understanding that love is not magic.  A lot of cliche platitudes in the latter for sure, but if you have time to watch the video, I think the eloquent way these ideas are delivered will ring through to you as a cloud of universal obviousness. 

--
Anyways, after that video I stumbled upon another one about this woman who grew up in a rural strip of Maine, writing and making folk music as a kid.  In school she lost her passion and stopped playing for a while.  However, on a year of study abroad in Paris she had a spiritual experience with dance music, which up to that point in time she believed was the cheapest, most generically manufactured genre of music.  But at that point, something ""clicked"" and she came back to school to make music in where she incorporated elements of folk in to dance music.  Very interesting and inspiring story about following passion and, as an aside, a very interesting sound too.

--
But in culmination of watching both of these videos (and some other less relevant ones) in the internet rabbit-hole I plunged in to that morning, I realized that I may be unhappy with where I am in life.

--
I am a recently graduated student working in the financial sector in a big financial-center city. I went to school for business.  When I first started, I always thought I'd do internships marketing, fusing my love for creativity and strategy together in a role that I can travel the world and make a decent-to-strong income.  It just so happened that when I applied for my first internships I happened to only get one offer, and it was in finance, so I took it, and ever since I did 3 more in investment finance, not straying off the safe path.  I thought I liked it, I still do think I like it in many ways.  One of the biggest attractions to me was (and is) the conquering of the learning curve of how to assess an investment.  Every investment is like a subjective, million-piece puzzle, but the pieces are moving around as relevant parts of reality change, as if carried around the table by ants, and understanding/conquering that process has always been a draw to me (it still is).

--
That being said. I recently took a full-time job and in this role I have become more and more jaded.  In many ways I feel like I am seeing some of the worst elements of the industry (intellectual laziness, dis-ingenuousness, white-lying by omission, putting spin on things) and it has been slowly crushing me and the love that I thought I had for my profession.  Furthermore, I feel like there is no real opportunity to learn here, I feel like the only thing I can do to keep expanding my knowledge is personal reading on my spare time.

--
**After watching these videos and doing some ""soul searching"" yesterday, I can't help but think that I have strayed from a possible path that I may have been happier with in life.**  I have always had a very deep understanding of sound and a passion for writing (something that I admittedly don't actually do very often, but I have become more infatuated with the idea of over time) and the more I think about things, the more that I feel that I should quit my job and travel the world (which I have done a bit of and loved deeply) while writing and maybe painting and exploring other venues of self expression and realization. Even if I am no good at any of those things, I think the experience may be more important and bring me close to self-realization for how I want to live my life.  

--
**On the flip side, I acknowledge the massive risk that this proposes to my life and career.**  I am a recent grad making decent money in a market where -- and I know this from first-hand experience -- it is very hard to find a job.  In many ways I am incredibly fortunate to be where I am, and a rational part of my brain is telling me not to do something so radical (I say ""A"" rational part, because at the same time, I also acknowledge that my desire for a step back and rethinking my life and my personal values is not grounded in irrationality).  

--
As far as a quick commentary of the ""Relationships"" part of the afformentioned commencement speech video.  I think in many ways my desire to do this is just as much about ""finding myself"" and learning to love, trust and respect myself, as it is about rethinking my career path and values as a person.  I have had mostly one night stands in terms of ""relationships"" with two smaller relationships that lasted 6 months and 1 month (the latter ending fairly recently).  I am still young, but still I feel like I should have experienced realer more serious relationships by this point in my life, as many of my friends and peers have started to over the last few years.  This in many ways is crushing to me too.  I feel like I wear my heart on my sleeve and I am filled with love for others, and I think in part this excess love is really surplus love that I should have for myself.  I guess what I am saying is that, in some ways, I think I don't love myself the way most people do.

I think I am unhappy, but am not sure... Is what I am doing right now just an investment that I should work out for a couple years so that I can reach greener pastures?  Should I wait to find out, given the way I've just described my feelings? Would it be short-sighted and frivolous to follow my gutt?  **I guess what I am ultimately asking is:   Reddit, based on the story I've just told, should I quit my job and go explore other venues that I used to think I was passionate for, but didn't do in order to ""play it safe""?**

I have had two full-stack development jobs, one as an intern for 16 months, and my current job which I have been at for a year. 
In my first job, I was making custom applications for a small unit and was solely responsible for maintaining and creating tools for them. I spent time gathering their needs and discussing how we could improve what we already had. 
My current job is lacking this direct communication aspect. I enjoyed sitting down with people to understand their requests and coming up with ways to solve their problems better than they had hoped for, and in a way that was less complicated for me to implement than their original request.


I'm interested in roles where you draw on Computer Science knowledge, but aren't in desk programming all day.
I see the jobs where you work to bridge the gap between the developers and the non-developers have somewhat inconsistent naming. Business Analyst and Programmer Analyst are sometimes used, but these labels seem to have a really wide variance in responsibility. Are there more names for this type of work? I'd love a role where I was still doing some programming, but it wasn't my entire job. 
I'm also open other suggestions of different types of work that involve some programming. Things like outreach also interest me, I enjoy teaching people how to code/program. 


To anyone in a position with less programming and more focus on communication - what are you doing, what is your position called, and how did you get there?


And more generally, what are some positions that require Computer Science in a sort of tangential way?"

I am a rising sophomore student here at GT and I am currently an ISyE major. I am thinking about switching to CS, however, but I am indecisive. 


The thing is, I am interested in both ISyE and CS (coding, programming, etc.). I would like to go into finance, banking, consulting, etc. but I am also interested in working at one of the big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.).


The problem, though, is that I would like to do more CS/programming stuff than what ISyE offers by itself (it only has like 3 CS classes total I believe) because I would like to work at one of the big tech companies like I mentioned above. But then again, I don't see myself coding every single day as a job forever (though I know that's not what every CS major does). 


Initially, I was going to stick with ISyE and just do a CS minor. But I've heard minors don't really mean that much and some employers don't really care for them. 


Now, I am thinking of completely switching over to CS so I will have a better chance at those tech companies I mentioned beforehand because I feel like they don't really hire ISyE majors (but finance, banking, consulting, etc. DO hire CS majors). Also, as an ISyE major, I don't feel very knowledgeable in programming compared to my CS friends/classmates even though I am interested in the same stuff and would like to do internships in those areas (P.S. would a CS minor help me get up there in terms of knowledge? I know I won't be an expert like the CS majors obviously, but will it be worth it?).


My mindset in the beginning was that I could really stand out as an ISyE major by having a huge CS background due to my internships and EC's plus maybe a CS minor (I am currently doing a good CS internship with GTRI, I will be a CS TA this fall, I know 3-4 programming languages, part of CS clubs, etc.). Now, though, I feel like if I switch to CS, I won't really stand out as much since a lot of CS majors know multiple languages, have done good CS internships, been CS TA's, etc.


What do you guys think I should do? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post btw, and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks so much for your help."

How do people who go to MIT for grad school find jobs?

I have been programming since my early teens.

I have programmed many software projects and created many hardware circuits which I've showcased, such as compilers, operating systems, websites, pipelined processors, etc.  I'd say I'm a top student and compared to 99% of my peers have more experience / qualifications.

However, I landed a pretty shitty internship which only pays 40k, which is around the same internships that other students with subpar 2.0 GPA's (from lesser schools) and no project experiences are doing.

Many of my peers with similar/less qualifications and similar GPA's got internships of 80-100k.  

I'm not sure what the issue could be, I actually applied to 50+ companies but only got 3 or 4 interviews, 1 of which was at a top company, but I didn't get into it.

me and one other dev are the only people working on the engineering side.

I feel that I'm not quite ready for an algo-heavy interview, even though I've done over 100 leetcode questions. I feel that with a bit more preparation, I can land a job at a bigger, non-big-N company.

I have a few questions:

1. I plan on applying while I'm working, and drop out of the internship as soon as I find a better job at a repuatable company. Thoughts on this?
2. Or should I stick it out of the 3 months, and start applying at the 1.5 month mark, and start immediately after 3 months if everything goes well?

I have a decent resume, but my technical skills were lacking, hence I couldn't get offers. I was able to get interviews with a few big N companies.

I plan on studying for interviews as soon as I get home everyday (40 hour work week), so I plan on doing a minimum of 2 leetcode mediums a day. I feel that I should be able to do another 150-200 questions before my internship ends.

I know for sure that I want to do something in the IT/Tech field. For the longest time, I had thought that I would declare comp sci as my major. I am still a beginner in programming and even though I like it (it's hard and frustrating because I have been self teaching my self - can't declare majors until sophomore year at my school so haven't been able to take a CS class yet), I just don't see my self ONLY coding at my job in the future. 

My school's comp sci department offers a ""Computer Information Science"" degree also, which is a lot of CS stuff along with a business aspect to it. I won't say its the equivalent of MIS, because the cirriculum contains a lot of CS (programming, database, algorithms, software engineering). but it also contains 18 hours of business courses.

I'm also working at my school's help desk in the IT department as a student consultant, and I am hoping it would really give me a boost when looking for internships and eventually a good job after graduation. 

I was wondering what would be better for me? Should I go with computer information science? What kind of jobs would be available to me? Job market? Have any of you done something similar?

As first year of my studies is nearing the end, I figured, I want to choose a specific language and start mastering it, because at uni, I feel like I'm just scraping the surface of everything. The problem is, I don't have any real life experience in programming and have no idea, how it all works. As just recently I started learning javaScript, I realized, I enjoy making websites and am considering going on an internship in web development. But the main question - if I choose going into web development, will I be missing out on everything else? Because I am also interested in making mobile apps, software and, as a hobby, I hope to make some games (yeah,yeah, I already know how difficult this is, I tried and failed already, I'll leave this for later :D). So if I go, for exapmle, into web development, I will mostly miss out on other stuff? 
I would mostly like to hear your own personal experience, have you shifted from one field to another? Why? How did it go? And, if it is not a big secret, in which field do you work, what do you do mostly and what languages/frameworks do you use?
Currently I know C++, javaScript(HTML and CSS as well) and some SQL.

6e0i26,9,2017-05-29,18 and still scared of girls + not many mates,willy2558,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/6e0i26/18_and_still_scared_of_girls_not_many_mates/,"Hi,
I need some help with my life, largely in terms of my relationships with other people. I'm 18 just started uni, doing the course I've always wanted to do after I did well at school, and have a casual bar job. My future career is looking quite promising as I've secured a couple of interviews for an internship in the field I'm studying. So I'm not very worried about this part of my life. Although this is going well I'm not career driven at all. 

However my friendships and relationships with others causes quite a bit of grief in my life. During school I was in quite a large friendship circle but really only had a couple of 'real' friends. One of them moved away to uni and I drifted apart from the other 2 over the past 6 months. I now really only have 1 good mate, who I smoke a lot of weed with (4-5 a week), and couple more pretty good mates. My lack of mates is only part of my problem however. Although I think I would be a lot happier if I had more mates I could call good mates, I don't really mind just having a couple of mates who I can hang out with and just be my self so this isn't causing too many issues. 

However I think about 80-90% of my depressing feelings about my relationships stem from my absolute non-existent contact with girls. In my life I've only kissed 4 girls and have never gone any further. 3 of those were party hookups that just happened when we were drunk and I don't speak to any of them, and one of them I spoke to for quite a while until she asked me out and I panicked and stopped talking to her. I 'know of' a couple of girls that I see around uni and at parties etc, but I wouldn't really call them friends as I'd never have more then a 1 minute conversation with them as I walked past, before I get too nervous and make an excuse that I have to go (but these girls wouldn't be interested in me anyway). I dont think I've ever talked about girls to my parents and if there is an even remote rumor that I'm friends with a girl my parents starting chatting about it to each other that I can over head. So i'm pretty sure my parents and most of my extended family think I'm gay. This leads me to often ask wether I'm gay? I notice I can sometimes be quite flamboyant when I speak but I've never had sexual urges for men and watch porn on nightly basis that is all women. Until about a year ago I couldn't even watch porn that showed lots of dick (BJ etc) because I hated the sight so much. 
I'm attracted to women and dream about losing my virginity soon, but I'm just so scared of girls. If a girl is roughly on my level or better (i'd say im about a 6.5-7 from rateme) I just get so scared. However I can easily drunken talk all night to a girl i dont find attractive if I'm out at a party, so its not that I don't have much to talk about, its just I get so nervous and scared when I talk to any girl I'm remotely interested. So when I do go to a party I just meet a bunch of new guys because I feel so much more comfortable. Alcohol helps a bit and I find I can introduce my self pretty easy and start off conversations well when a bit drunk, but if a girl shows and signs of interest I make an excuse to leave then don't really try and reingage in a conversation when I return. Again this is with girls I have any sort of attraction too. Also I notice I start getting really nervous and panicky if one of my mates were to leave me alone for a bit with some girls. An example of this is when I went out with 3 mates to a club and I was sitting next to my mates and a girl came up to me. I was pretty interested in her and we started chatting, but I'd always bring my mates in the conversation. Then my mates had to quickly run down to the servo to grab some cigarettes so they left me with her and I just felt so scared and panicked. I tried to maintain the conversation with her but my nerves overwhelmed and I think I ran after my mates 10 minutes later. Just another thing to add I'm pretty sure I have anxiety. I hate crowds almost as much as a one on one conversation with an attractive girl. I often walk extra distances all over my uni just so I can miss popular hang out spots.
Lastly I just want to point out where I think this all started. I remember in my early days I have such happy memories with friends and remember being a large extrovert, always wanting to be the first person to start a conversation, never being embarrassed, never caring what others thought etc. This was until when I was 12-13 and my school had a dance with some girl schools. As usual, because at that time I was quite extroverted, I was talking to lots of girls at the dance having a great time, until one girl asked if I wanted to be her boyfriends (I met her that night, we never kissed etc etc #twelvielyfe). I remember just feeling so panicked that she asked me so quickly and I said no. Then the weeks following I remember just feeling so nervous and anxious about the event for some random reason, and I think thats where my relationship with women was doomed.  I've never really considered my bad feelings about friendships to be 'depression' but maybe it is?
Anyways, I know this is very long, but I'm hoping some of you will be able to give me pointers on how I can improve this aspect of my life? Should I seek medication? This is the first time I've ever said all this, but I feel much more comfortable asking here then my parents or any relatives I know.
Although It may sounds like I'm doing a lot in life, a lot of the parties/clubs I've mentioned have been over the past year in a bit. I think in total over the past 2 years I've attended a maximum of 10-15 large social events (parties, clubs etc). When I'm not working or at uni, I just sit at home on my laptop living a sad life...
Thanks

We recently lost the one programmer with Japanese +English abilities, and I was offered the chance to work in Tokyo to replace him for a work term in 2018 Spring.

However, I also have an internship offer at a somewhat prestigious company here in America for next Spring 2018 (not top 5 level, but definitely has name recognition across the board, definitely more than my current company).

Which of the two options would give a college student higher employability in the long term? Any other thoughts?

- Working abroad at a lesser known company 
- Language acquisition 
- Company loyalty 

Option 2:
- Moving up to a more recognized and established company

A few questions for those of you who have gone through a bootcamp or have knowledge on them: 

Are graduates usually only successful getting jobs locally around said bootcamp? (With employers in the area that already know about it). Is there any success in putting this on your resume and applying say, somewhere across the country after graduation? 

Will I need to pursue higher education (bsC or Masters in CompSci) to move up in a company?

Is JavaScript a must as a Front End developer, and would it make sense economically and considering job availability to go into an iOS Dev course over a web dev course? Or is it just mainly a preference thing?

At this point I'm considering a bootcamp vs a sales internship in silicon valley. While I know I'll probably make more money starting out there, I don't know if I'll fully enjoy being a sales monkey and the astronomical price of living there.

My question is: Is a Masters in CS possible if you don't have an undergrad in CS. I want to set myself up to succeed so how do I get that experience to apply and do well in a Masters program. How else can I get the knowledge and experience I need to build credibility and increase my information? I don't think I can afford to do another undergrad if I ever apply to grad school.

Thank you!"

Like should I practice a new language on my own, work on old ones, study something specific, or something else? I'm not doing a programming degree, like next year I'll be taking network security classes and the such, but still more programming courses the future. What did those who have already graduated and gotten a job do back this early in there CS education?

I'm wondering - what will change once i get the degree, of course there will be internships, I could move abroad, what else is their? Everyone seems to aim for at least a degree in the subject, but is it necessary and why? So far just from having a HNC I've found not really any doors to be open for me, hope this changes once i get past degree level. Even if I don't have options open for me now, there's a good chance it will in the future."

I don't have any internship experience. I have a mediocre GPA (2.9), and only have a few personal projects- iOS &amp; Android applications, and a basic LAMP structured website. I really like programming, it's fun and I genuinely could see myself doing it in the future. But my financial situation is pretty dire. I'm going to be about 45k in debt upon graduation and my parents won't be able to support me much at all so I'm going to have to start working somewhere right away.

This summer I applied to 5 or 6 internships in my area, and although I got a phone interview with 4 of them, I only moved onto the in person interview for 2 of them. I didn't land either. 

Here's what I'm going to focus on this summer since I didn't land any internships: 

- Leetcode problems- I'm going to complete as many as I can.

- Introduction to Algorithms(CLRS) and Cracking the Coding Interview - I'm going to learn as much as I can from those two books as I can.

- One big personal project to beef up my resume.


I want to work in web development. If I achieve my summer goals, do I have a chance at landing a decent job this time next year, even though I'm not a CS major? 

Thank you all. This subreddit has been of great help to me and I appreciate any comments.

Part of my project will be making a UI, in C#. I'm comfortable with C (took 2 semesters of it), but I have not experience with UI's

I will be making a device that has a motorized stage and a spectrometer (a sensor, kinda). Both devices have code/software, but I have to basically control both, get data, then implement an algorithm(s) for computation, then repeat and spit out data. I'm kinda lost at where to even start. The internship hasn't started and they'll give me more guidance and direction when I'm there, but I want to start preparing. Compared to all my projects in C, where I'd use a text editor then compile in terminal, do I need an IED for C#? How's the syntax and general conceptual elements?

If anyone has advice/resources regarding learning C# or the basis of developing a UI, that would really helpful. 

I will have help from graduate students but this is mainly my research project for the summer. I thought C and C# were similar but I've realized that's not the case (at least from trying to look at code myself). 

Anything helps, thanks

EDIT: grammar

EDIT: so this UI is for anyone using the device. It's essentially allows them to set up, run the program, and get data. Probably will be on a laboratory computer (aka it'll never leave the lab)."

1. As a recruiter (if you were/are one), what kind of independent projects would you be mostly impressed by. 
Or what kind of  independent projects really stand out?

2. How can resumes standout? How to make interviews happen? How would you reach to a recruiter and make him call you for an interview? If you are a recruiter, when would you not throw my resume in bin because I am just another ""applicant""

Long Version: 

As the title says, I am a senior and double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. GPA is not  bad (&gt;3.5). However, I do not have any internship experience yet. All the projects I have done are homework assignments (only a handful and small). No independent projects of any sort either. 

I am proficient in Java and learning python and C++ right now.
Couldn't get any summer internships. Will try again in the fall. 

I am interested in the field Data Science( Big Data, Data Mining and Machine Learning). So, I have been reading a lot about it recently. My school has a professor who has projects on Big data, but since he has no funding, I will do volunteer work for him starting this fall. That hopefully will give me some experience. But I do know, that will not be enough.  

So, what can I start doing today so that I can get a job when I graduate? What should my plan look like? Anyone in this situation before and succeeded, how did you make it?
Any suggestions are welcomed. (blog posts or youtube videos.. anything). 

So far, I have

1. A Github account setup and uploaded my assignments. I try to update it   regularly, with whatever random code I write.
2. An updated LinkedIn account
3. I am trying to create a list of independent projects that I want to work on. Will start working on projects soon. ( Projects that take 100-150 hours of work)
4. Working on interviews. Reading CTCI and Programming Interviews Exposed. 
5. Brushing up my on data structure and algorithms (going through CLRS)
6. Collecting  job postings related to data science to see a common ground and learning few things that almost every recruiter is asking for.  

I know I need to do independent projects that I am most interested in, and can make a difference( if possible), but apart from that, what do companies look for. That is to say, what are the traits of ideal projects ( if there are any) for recruiters and companies?

Lets say if I am able to to do few really good projects, then how can I stand out in the crowd? How do I make interviews happen? And anyone reading this, what would you want to see in my resume that would make you call me for an interview. What would make you look at my resume even?

I know.. my main goal should not be to impress recruiters.. and it's not. I am seriously interested in learning and I always do that. I love CS and Math. I will.. forever. But given the financial circumstances, I need a job when I graduate anyhow. I just want to do everything that I can do from my side and I need advice on it. 


Any comment or suggestions will be truly appreciated. 

Thank you.

This month I've started my first software engineering internship (rising junior CS major), and so far I was mostly writing Python scripts to automate different tasks for a big-data startup.
Before starting my internship, I was using Windows and was briefly to Unix system only in one rather theoretical, not in-depth academic course in my university. Now I'm working on a Mac, which is cool, but I feel like I lack a lot of basic understanding of how things works.

I follow basic tutorials and copypasta commands whenever I'm trying to accomplish tasks like work with github, open ssh, install various packages (pip/brew/whatever?), but I can't really tell what are good practices and what aren't. I've always tried to understand why I'm doing certain things and how they work under the hood, avoiding blindly repeating some instructions. I was wondering if anyone here has a good book, tutorial or an in-depth guide for beginner developers in a Unix/Mac environment?

I just finished my second year as a Physics major at Emory University, but I am doing Emory's Dual Degree Program. What this means is that provided I meet the requirements, after next year, I'll be transferring to GATech, where I'll do Computer Engineering for 2 years, graduating after a total of 5 years with a B.S in Physics from Emory and a B.S in CE from Tech. I've also been doing Nanoscience and Condensed Matter research at Emory for about a year and a half now. I'm pretty ambitious in terms of what I want to accomplish and I was hoping for some advice on how to get there. 

I think of my career less in terms of positions, and more in terms of projects/problems. I am excited by a lot of ideas, but the three main projects I obsess over are optical computers, wireless power transfer, and the CE side of human cybernetics (broadly speaking). Yes, I know these are kind of ""moonshot"" projects, and that is kind of the point. I dream of working on any or ideally all of these within my lifetime.

I really want to play a big role in developing new technology, and I'm particularly interested in applying ""new"" physics to engineering problems. I recognize that pursuing huge projects like this is expensive, and so to pursue them, aside from the appropriate knowledge, I'd either need the credibility to secure investment, or the credibility to be hired by a company who has that kind of investment. My questions will be centered around what steps I should be taking to get to a place where I can play a significant role in researching and implementing cutting edge computer engineering tech.

1. I see a lot of talk about how necessary a Ph.D is. Is this more based on the knowledge you acquire, or simply the fact that companies won't allow you to progress without one?

2. If I didn't get a B.S in CE, but instead just got a Physics, or Engineering Physics B.S and took some higher level Comp Sci courses, are there Ph.D CE programs that would take me?

3. Any suggestions on some projects I should be taking on now, to both improve my skills and demonstrate profficiency when applying for internships or other opportunites?

Thanks."

Not even that one asshole telling me to fuck off and die already.*

I can't really believe it. I've always been so lonely. Always. 

My parents love me as... a person they created, for what they think they see in me and maybe what they want to see. 
My husband... loves the idea of love and even the idea of me or who he thinks I should be or even one day could be.
My younger siblings... we have a commonality and grows more faint as time passes. 
My baby loves me because I take care of her and one day she'll stop needing me.

None of these are love for me. For who I actually am. None of these are concern or remedy for the constant isolating loneliness, and the loneliness is only secondary to the real pain. Pain can be remedied when you have someone to acknowledge it. To see you through it but I feel like I've never had that. 

I've always felt like an alien here. Like I don't belong and I never have and I play this part and I go through the motions but it feels wrong. I don't feel like anyone has ever validated my struggle. Not my parents, or doctors or friends or husband. It's always been something to avoid. Ignore. Minimalize. 

Minimalize. That's the big one. 

""Everyone goes through bad times""

""It get's better.""

""No one in this world doesn't have problems""

""Other people have it way worse than you""

""I'm depressed too, you know. Don't you care about my feelings?""

""How do you think it makes me feel when you talk about wanting to kill yourself?""

""You're so frustrating when you self-harm.""

The school psychological services that assigned me to some fucking intern. The doctor who casually suggested a random counselor or drugs and brushed it off by talking about her own problems without providing any proper assessment or diagnosis. My husband who can't even acknowledge that there is an actual problem and will never treat it with any sensitivity. My parents and friends who must think it's all over. 

And all the times everyone pretended it didn't happen. Woke up the next morning like it's ok. 

Have you ever hated someone so deeply? Loathed their very being at it's core? Blamed them for everything wrong with yourself? If you haven't, then imagine the next closest thing you can. Picture that person who you hate the most. What did you do to them? What would you do? Would you hurt them? Would you kill them? Have you? Why not?

You see, for me... that person I hate is me. I hate me so much that I want to destroy myself. I've felt that way for a very long time. 

Most people's answer to why they haven't hurt that person they hate the most is usually either forgiveness or the threat of legal repercussions, like being convicted of murder or assault. The rules we live by are enough stop you. 

Those rules don't exactly apply in my particular situation. No one makes a police report when I hurt myself and if I'm dead, I sure can't go to prison. I can hurt myself as much as I need to as long as I'm careful enough to hide it, meaning nothing severe enough to require professional medical attention but enough to punish myself. Contrary to popular belief, it's not attention seeking at all. So low-key, concealable self-injury or just have an excuse. Not even a great one. It doesn't even have to be convincing. People will buy anything when it makes it easier to just not talk about it. That's generally a good enough test for me to weed out who is actually ready and willing to help and those who feel obligated to be concerned. Nobody passes that test. 

That's how I'll know someone loves me. I think the only way I'll believe that I'm worth loving is when someone actually loves me enough to step into the darkness and shine the light at the end of the tunnel. I promise I'll get up and find my way out. I just need to know where to go and that someone sees me, really sees me, and actually wants me to join them so I don't have to feel alone on this space rock anymore."

Throwaway account here, but I was really hoping some people working in CS (especially as recruiters) could give me some advice.

I'm super interested in machine learning and computer vision (and have been for years), but I've noticed that almost everything in the field requires a master's degree when applying. Is this just because undergrad students don't usually focus enough on a specific branch of CS? In other words, would you consider interviewing an undergrad with significant experience in these branches of CS despite the job description requesting a master's?

Here is a little bit about me.

 * Major: ECE, minors: math/CS. cumulative GPA: 3.96, major GPA: 4.0. 

 * Industry experience: I am about to start my second software engineering internship, which will be computer vision and autonomous robotics at Lockheed Martin. My first internship was on big data analytics for a DoD contractor.

 * Research experience: I do research on autonomous robotics and image processing at school (~2 years). I've been the only developer on all of my projects, ranging from designing and writing navigational algorithms for rovers (e.g. interplanetary exploration) from scratch to debugging, optimizing, and improving a library for feature-based anomaly classification for images via OpenCV. I have been coauthored in a peer-reviewed journal for these two projects. There are other projects that I have worked on in my lab also, but these are the only ones that directly apply to the field I want to go into.

 * Other stuff: Around 3-4 different awards/scholarships throughout college for research and academics, Eagle scout, etc. I also won an award at my first internship for outstanding performance and have worked as an undergrad TA for 3 different classes (2 programming courses and diff eq).

 * Programming Languages: C/C++, Python, Java, MATLAB, UNIX, and a tiny bit of Scala, Swift. I'm planning on picking up R this summer.

Lastly, I will have taken machine learning as a course and will be taking computer vision next semester, but I feel that these courses aren't as significant as my research and internship experience.

Do you think it would be possible for me to get a good job in this field out of college, even though most of them require a master's degree? I would love to go to grad school at some point, but unfortunately, it would be *very* difficult to go right away due to financial reasons. :(

Another option would be to apply to less specialized CS jobs, make some money, and then go to grad school, specialize more, and then get the job I want. But this would be less ideal, because I already know what I enjoy. I just don't want to make the mistake of *only* applying to ML/computer vision jobs and getting destroyed purely because I don't have a master's degree. I will be graduating Spring 2018."

I've applied for a lot of internships with no luck, so I decided to start working again part-time as a lifeguard at home. Then, I got an interview for a Full-Stack Web Development Internship at a local company, which I just finished. They said they really liked me, but didn't catch that I would be returning to an out of state university at the end of the summer. They said that in their experience, it takes about 2 months before an intern can start making meaningful contributions, and so they wouldn't be able to offer a paid internship for the summer since I'd be leaving right away and they have lots of very competitive applicants who go to a local university and could stay on. However, they did offer me an unpaid internship. Usually I'd steer clear of unpaid work, but at this point in the summer I don't think that I'll be able to get any other related internship. I would be working on their web application with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. 

The two developers who interviewed me seemed very sincere and apologized for not catching the fact that I would be leaving. Would this experience be worth working unpaid?

Settling in the chair I looked across the embassy office at the alien, and tensed.

Large the creatures were vaguely humanoid in shape, two legs, two arms a torso and a head. Beyond that general shape it was different from a standard human. Its legs had two knees and claws that curved upwards. Its skin was a vibrant purple flecked with green in places. The hands were six fingered and stubby the claws cut back.

Its robes were a dull brown, and the regal pose combined with the very humanlike glare from its two eyes the creature was plainly trying to intimidate me.

I gestured at the chair in front of my desk, &amp;quot;Councilor, would you please sit?&amp;quot;

The Beami snarled, &amp;quot;I will not sit.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Very well then, what is the issue Councilor,&amp;quot; I checked his nametag, a woven string of characters on the top of his robes telling his life&amp;#39;s journey from hometown to the Hub, &amp;quot;Jarali? Am I saying that correctly?&amp;quot;

He waved his hand dismissing my pronunciation, &amp;quot;You and every other member of your species has been lying to us! To this entire Council, every member of the Hub! Your petition to join with us will be denied and I am of half a mind to order you be imprisoned here to answer for what you and your people have done!&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;What have we done?&amp;quot; I asked keeping my voice cool. The diplomatic group had been at the Hub for nearly a year, and besides a few heated negotiations over trading regulations everything had been moving along at a steady pace.

Jarali narrowed his eyes and clicked his talons on the floor. I ignored the display.

&amp;quot;You are a machine.&amp;quot; Spat Jarali.

I looked down at the gray synthetic skin that covered my frame and the mechanics that were moving underneath it.

&amp;quot;We have never hidden that fact Councilor.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;No, but it does make you a curiosity. Only two other synthetic races have joined the Hub. You are like neither of them. You act as if you are a creature of blood and gore.&amp;quot;

I nodded in agreement, the other two synthetic races were nothing like us. The Hala were obsessed with the acquisition of knowledge, and simply hoarded all they could. Paying massive amounts of credits and resources to acquire the libraries of new species when they first joined the Hub. They never created anything of their own though, and never processed what they had in any meaningful way.

The Binaries were the other race, if von neumann probes could be called a race. Uninterested in talking or trading the machines moved slowly, between star systems terraforming planets.

Whoever had programmed them had been single-minded, but ethical. The probes never moved into star systems that had life. The machines had no data on who created them, and the small central ship controlling the rest of them simply drifted on the outskirts of the Hub system talking only when prompted, otherwise content to wait for its brethren to slowly move across the stars and transform the planets to support life.

&amp;quot;We act as we have always acted. We are not going to change.&amp;quot;

Jarali&amp;#39;s talon dug into the wood of my office floor, I winced at the damage. It had taken a long time to ship in the Oak from Earth. &amp;quot;You are raising a fully biological creature as your offspring!&amp;quot;

I frowned, this had not been the direction I had seen the conversation going.

&amp;quot;David? What about him?&amp;quot;

Jarali scowled down at me, &amp;quot;You are not the child&amp;#39;s parent. You are a synthetic, and all documentation points to both of you being Human. You have lied to us, and manipulated the Hub.&amp;quot;

Slowly I stood. &amp;quot;We are both Human, and David is my son.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;You are a machine, one that is pretending to be a biological creature! You may lie to the creature you say is your son, but we are not as easily fooled. Which is Human, you or your son?&amp;quot;

I ground my teeth together, &amp;quot;Both. If, however you mean biologically my son is Human.&amp;quot;

Jarali sneered, &amp;quot;And what are you? Surely you are not Human &amp;#39;biologically&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;

I considered the Hub creature. &amp;quot;No. I am as you pointed out a synthetic. In Sol culture I am Human, four hundred years ago my kind of Human was created in a lab, and we have ever since continued to grow in harmony with those who created us. We are not wholly like them, but together we are Human.&amp;quot;

The Beami stamped its talons down.

&amp;quot;You are a machine, raising a biological creature, and you claim it is your son this is wrong!&amp;quot;

I narrowed my lips, &amp;quot;In your opinion. This is the way of Humanity. Some Humans raise and train infant synthetics, small algorithms and lines of code that take years to grow. Some Humans raise biological creatures of similar helplessness. Most biological Humans raise biological children, most synthetic Humans raise synthetics. Sometimes it is more important the child has a home. My wife is biological, and she is on Earth at the moment raising our daughter Nickel, who is a machine like me.&amp;quot;

I stepped towards him, &amp;quot;This is what Humanity is.&amp;quot;

Jarali raised his stubby hands up, &amp;quot;It is wrong. I have done what I must. No machine should have a biological child in its care. The child is being taken into custody as we speak, and will be looked after by the Council until such time that,&amp;quot;

I jumped out of the body I was in. Vaguely from one of the hundreds of camera feeds of the Hub I saw it drop to the ground in my office. The body would need to be replaced, the Councilor had begun clawing at it with his talons as soon as it hit the ground.

The sparking wires and connections from my emergency jump out of it making the thing smolder.

Unfurling my mind into all the alien computer systems I broke diplomatic protocol, and simply rammed through every form of cybersecurity. I sent the last several minutes of my perception to every other Human on the Hub.

Those who were on our ship docked at the outer edge, dropped their bodies as well and moved into the computer systems with me. Other Humans watched a summary of the events someone had edited together in an instant and began to either collect their own items and move towards the ship, or gather weapons.

David had been touring one of the alien markets with Helena, a young synthetic who was working with the diplomatic teams as part of an internship. She hadn&amp;#39;t been brought along to the Hub to watch David, but she said she enjoyed taking him off my hands for meetings.

I had no doubt she was attempting to earn some favoritism for jobs after graduation. She had earned that.

Helena hadn&amp;#39;t jumped out of her body at my message. Limited by the amount of processing power on a mobile platform and her inexperience she was only slightly faster reacting than the biological creatures around her when the guards moved into the market.

The two scaly Yaeik stepped out from behind a stall selling small figures David had been looking at. The Yaeik bore the official Hub markings, a black a yellow mashing of colors that to Human eyes at least was an ugly thing. The weapons they were holding marked them as security.

David didn&amp;#39;t see them, still intent on the trinkets. Helena burst forwards slamming a fist into one Yaeik&amp;#39;s chest. Its scales cracked and a sound like gunshot went off. The officer grunted in pain, taking a step back. The second security guard swung his gun towards her. Helena jumped out of her body leaving her brain sparking and ruined.

The alien fired, a bolt of plasma seared through the synthetic platforms skin and ate at the internals.

&amp;quot;Ambassador!&amp;quot; Helena had joined the mass of other Humans in the computers. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do, and I panicked, I left David alone!&amp;quot;

I shook my head, a motion communicated through code and shorthand bursts of data. It wasn&amp;#39;t the same as an organic motion, but the meaning carried.

&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not in trouble Helena. We weren&amp;#39;t expecting this. I&amp;#39;ve got a plan.&amp;quot;

Helena blinked, and looked around at every other Human. Someone tossed her a data packet of the hasty plan I had contracted and her eyes widened. &amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot;

The events outside computer accelerated time were slow, but still happening. David had turned around at the sound of Helena&amp;#39;s fist hitting the guard. His scream as she was shot in front of him echoed through the compartment.

Every single Human on the Hub was lending me their power and expertise.

The code breakers were feeding me the access codes to every device in the Market.

The soldiers were feeding me tactical analysis. The training of the Hub guards, and the skills of the two in front of my Son.

Those who had no skill to add, donated computer power lending me their own runtimes and processing resources. It pushed them out of machine time, and into a perception close to a biological Human. Leaving me and those working more time, to solve all the problems.

The Biological Humans on the Hub were also moving, they had only been informed of what was happening seconds ago but they were moving, I already had the plan worked out.

&amp;quot;Run David!&amp;quot; I shouted the words through every device in the Market.

David&amp;#39;s eyes widened his gaze flicking up to meet the Yaeik&amp;#39;s. He ran straight at the lumbering creatures, weaving between the two of the before they could react. His small legs were a blur, and not a blur, while he ran.

I could approximate his exact physical condition down to the small oddly formed callous on his right pinkie toe based on the data and analysis every Human was feeding to me, based on every source of data in the Hub.

I paid it little mind, my hundreds of eyes focused on my Son as he ran through the aliens and creatures around him.

&amp;quot;Which way?&amp;quot; shouted David, his voice cracking as he ran through one aisle of the market.

&amp;quot;Right!&amp;quot; I shouted.

The alien&amp;#39;s in the market all looked down at their devices, wondering why they were speaking in an alien voice for the second time in only moments.

Aliens in the market were watching David now, running as guards continued to stream out of the different segments of the market. The old-style radio communicators they were using not something that could be jammed in such proximity.

I checked on the status of the ship.

&amp;quot;Dad, what&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot; asked David to the open air as he continued to run, taking in sucking breaths as he did so.

&amp;quot;The Hub does not like the idea of Synthetic Human&amp;#39;s raising Biological Humans.&amp;quot;

David frowned and his paced slowed by a fraction, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Keep running David!&amp;quot;

A large alien, one I didn&amp;#39;t even bother to identify barreled through one market stall sending materials in every direction as he moved to grab David.

A piece of some building material flew into David&amp;#39;s path, and he tripped. In machine time, I could only watch the spectacle with painful slowness. By the time he hit the warn metal floor, I had an analysis of all injuries he would sustain with 97% accuracy.

The ship was on the move now, the biological Humans inside of it moving with as much haste as they could.

They ripped the ship away from the dock it was moored at inside the antigravity field, and spinning it around in space gleefully ignored all warnings the Hub control was shouting at them.

Several code breakers hastily disabled the weapons of the Hub.

&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m hopping out, Helena!&amp;quot; I shouted it through the digital void.

Helena was pulled back to me.

&amp;quot;Ambassador?&amp;quot; she asked.

&amp;quot;You take over. I need to get him myself.&amp;quot;

She nervously swallowed, &amp;quot;Got it!&amp;quot;

Slipping into the position of control I had been in only a millisecond before Helena continued to direct every Human in the market computer systems.

Jumping out of the alien computer systems into the ship I stepped out of one alcove and grabbed the shotguns off the rack. The androgynous body I had taken out of storage quickly began to morph into my usual form. Grabbing a pistol, I slid it into the holster that had formed at my waist.

&amp;quot;Ambassador!&amp;quot; George slammed a hand down onto my shoulder.

I glanced at him, &amp;quot;How close?&amp;quot;

The scarred veteran glanced at his HUD. &amp;quot;Twenty seconds.&amp;quot;

I chambered a round into the shotgun, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to try to not kill. This appears to be a social impasse, and miscommunication.&amp;quot;

George frowned, &amp;quot;One big enough they want to take your kid?&amp;quot;

I huffed in annoyance, &amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t appear to have much faith in Machines.&amp;quot; I spat the final word out. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re fine trading and making peace with us if we&amp;#39;re machines, but biological and technology apparently shouldn&amp;#39;t mix.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s it?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;As much as I could wrangle from the Councilor, I cut the body when he said he was taking David into custody.&amp;quot;

George shook his head bewildered.

Neither man said nothing as a stranglet fueled, nanite controlled charge was jettisoned from the bay of the ship. It tore into the hull of the Hub, tunneling though the compartments towards the inner hull where David and the Market was.

The stranglets were being chaperoned, and contained by the small machines which directed them to remove all solid inanimate matter through subspace to a location 100 meters off the Hub. All creatures contained in the path of the weapon, including those only large enough to be seen with a microscope were pushed into other compartments of the Hub.

A small network of the nanites quickly formed temporary atmospheric shields as the ship dove backwards into the hole that had been created.

The back hatch of the ship opened, and I threw myself out through it.

Pulled down by the Hub&amp;#39;s gravity well I watched as the last compartment bulkhead dissolved far below.

David glanced up at the small disruption in the air, and his eyes widened, a smile appeared on his face and I felt one tugging at my own even as I consulted with Helena and looked around for threats.

The floor bowed inwards and screeched in protest as I landed. George slammed into the plating next to me, falling to one knee from the impact before quickly standing.

&amp;quot;Dad!&amp;quot;

David ran to me, and threw his small hands around my waist.

I kept the shotgun raised as the guards and aliens all around the small shopping district stared at us.

&amp;quot;Are you Ok?&amp;quot; I asked David glancing down at him.

He nodded, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine, what&amp;#39;s happening? Is Helena OK?&amp;quot;

_&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine David!&amp;quot;_ Her voice streamed out of the small communicator at my waist.

A commotion to the side drew my eyes, I watched waiting as the ship continued to move carefully down through the hole it had excavated in the hull of the Hub.

The purple alien burst out of a door, and his eyes went wide at the destruction.

&amp;quot;Councilor Jarali.&amp;quot;

The alien did a double take looking at me, and then back at the door. He had just left a body in my office, only three compartments away. It was the same body I had used since David had been born

&amp;quot;Ambassador?&amp;quot; asked the alien.

I inclined my head.

The alien swallowed, &amp;quot;I fear we have stumbled upon a cultural impasse.&amp;quot;

I curled a lip at him, &amp;quot;You were attempting to take my son.&amp;quot;

Jarali took a hesitant step forward. His robes were rumpled now, and I took some amount of vindictive pride in the fact that the talons on his feet were dulled. Ripping up the other body had no doubt been difficult to do with only biological appendages.

&amp;quot;Daaaved, that is not your father! That is a machine!&amp;quot;

My son scoffed, &amp;quot;Dad is Dad!&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;It is a machine! It should not be raising you! You are flesh and blood!&amp;quot;

David pouted, and raising his hand slowly extended a middle finger at the alien. I had to fight to contain my laughter. George not so controlled scoffed.

_&amp;quot;Helena?&amp;quot;_ I silently asked.

The girl remained silent, sheepish embarrassment filtered through all of the Humans in the computer systems. Most had moved into the ship, now only a few still in the alien computer systems.

&amp;quot;David, go with George.&amp;quot;

He dropped his hand, and quickly nodded his face red.

&amp;quot;OK.&amp;quot;

George leaned down and picked him up, &amp;quot;Come on little guy, we get to use the jets.&amp;quot;

David&amp;#39;s eyes widened, &amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot;

George nodded, and activated the devices on his boots. Quickly he shot up into the air and back into the ship.

The Hub security having had time to regroup watched him leave, and their gaze shifted to me. I was a single creature in a crowd of hundreds now. With only two guns.

Not that it really mattered.

I stepped towards the Councilor.

His gaze dropped from the hole in the Hub, &amp;quot;You have no doubt ruined your chances of joining the Hub with your actions here.&amp;quot; Said Jarali.

My face hardened, &amp;quot;Councilor, I prevented a war. What you just witnessed was every single Human, biological and Synthetic working together. With only a second warning we decimated your cybersecurity, physical security, and prevented a war. I will not apologize for that.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;A war?&amp;quot;

I let my eyes darken, &amp;quot;You tried to take my Son.&amp;quot;

Jarali opened his mouth to say something, but quickly thought better of it. &amp;quot;We would not have harmed the human. The Hub does not wish to bring harm to any creature.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care. Humanity will not stand for any culture that does not recognize all of us.&amp;quot;

Jarali frowned, he stepped forwards. &amp;quot;I do not understand.&amp;quot;

I lowered my weapon.

&amp;quot;Admitting that is a start. For now, though, we are leaving the Hub. When you are ready to talk again, and recognize all of us. Humanity will be eager to join the Hub.&amp;quot;

The Councilor clicked his talons. &amp;quot;I look forward to that day.&amp;quot;

Turning from him, I activated the jets in my own legs and drifted up to the ship. The ship quickly began to move away from alien structure as I settled into my seat.

&amp;quot;Dad?&amp;quot;

I relaxed at the sound of his voice. He was fine. He was safe. We were on a Human ship.

&amp;quot;David?&amp;quot;

He extended his hand, one of the small trinkets from the stall was in his hand, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t pay for this.&amp;quot;

I blinked at the small thing. It was a figurine of the same species as the Councilor, dressed in what looked like formal regalia.

&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s King Zea, I was watching one of the shows he was on. The Hub had these different shows, he&amp;#39;s the King of the educational building on planet Imagine.&amp;quot;

I sighed and picked David up, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll send payment to the vendor. You&amp;#39;re not in trouble.&amp;quot;

David&amp;#39;s face brightened, and then fell. &amp;quot;What about the bad hand?&amp;quot;

I rolled my eyes, &amp;quot;You shouldn&amp;#39;t do that, definitely don&amp;#39;t show your mother, but you&amp;#39;re not in trouble for that.&amp;quot;

David nodded absorbing everything, &amp;quot;Will we be going back?&amp;quot;

I pulled him into a hug, &amp;quot;I hope so. Assuming your mother doesn&amp;#39;t kill me for all of this trouble.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s going to be mad?&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s going to be mad.&amp;quot;

David squirmed in my arms, &amp;quot;Good luck Dad!&amp;quot;

He jumped out of my lap and falling into the seat next to me started to play with his figurine.

Settling in the chair I looked across the ship at my son, and relaxed.

If there is, please let me know! 

So last semester, the Spring of 2017, was supposed to be my last semester of my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering. Unfortunately I got in the way of myself... 

Depression hit me like a ton of bricks... I ended up not attending the majority of my classes or completely neglecting my responsibilities, assignments, quizzes, and exams. This resulted in me failing all 4 of my classes I was taking. I was able receive an incomplete grade from two of my professors, but the other two classes still ended up as 'F's. 

Obviously, this has been a huge setback for me. It's an even bigger problem considering both of those classes are only offered during the Spring meaning it will be almost a full year before I can go back and get my degree. 

Currently, I am living with my fiancée 14 hours away from where we attended school. She graduated a semester before me and received a full-time job in that city. So, my job options are even more limited. 

I am coming to Reddit for help because my school's counselor offered me no assistance with the questions I had. 

My first question deals with engineering in general. I started out loving my choice to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering, but during my junior and senior years I really soured on the idea. I realized the only aspects of Engineering I enjoyed (programming, automation, embedded systems, robotics) weren't really Electrical Engineering jobs. So, I decided to pick up some minors in Robotics and Computer Science my junior year. The further I got into those classes, though, I realized I was awful at programming and that I had a huge learning curve ahead of me. I did end up making my way through those classes, but the 'C's and 'D's I received really pulled my GPA down and made me feel like I wasn't cut out for those kind of jobs anyway. The place where my fiancée and I live offers very few jobs in the fields I am interested in, and the few that are available require high GPAs. It has always been my dream to work in sports industry,  and now I have also fallen in love with the craft beer industry. I also want to keep my options as open as possible as I am truly worried I may be miserable in an engineering job. So now I feel stuck. As to not ask an extremely general ""What should I do now?"" question, I will pose these questions. 

1.) Do you have any suggestions of how to go about a job search for what I am interested in? Is there good websites that will allow me to use keywords like programming, embedded, automation, robotics, etc. when searching for a job? Is there better words to use as keyword when doing a job search? Is there words I should look out for in job titles that would suggest they include a significant amount of one of the above keywords? 
2.) Is there any sort of Computer Engineering jobs in either the sports industry or the craft beer industry? If not, is there a way I can branch off from my degree and get my foot into one of those industries? What other sort of fields does an engineering degree translate well to?

Finally, my resume isn't the greatest. I have only has 1 internship as a Software Engineer, my GPA is mediocre (around a 2.75), and I don't actually have a degree. So, since it will still be another year before I am able to finally finish my degree and another 6+ months before I can even go back to school... 

1.) Is it still possible to land an engineering job that would allow me to move up in the company once I receive my degree? Possibly an Engineering Technician job? 
2.) Should I look for companies offering internships in the area and let them know that I would be interested in full-time opportunities once I obtain my degree? 
3.) Are there other jobs that don't require a bachelors degree I should be on the look out for that would help me get my foot in the door of either the sports or craft beer industry? Something similar to my education background? 
4.) Is freelance programming a decent option to help myself make money while still building skills? Any websites to look into for that? What kind of freelancing would be best to help me build the appropriate skills for robotic/automation/embedded applications? "
6eaf6m,1,2017-05-30,"Negotiate to have my official title read ""IT Intern"" or ""IT Assistant""?",crastle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6eaf6m/negotiate_to_have_my_official_title_read_it/,"I'm in kind of a weird situation because of events in the last couple months.  I might take a job as an accounting assistant for a small construction company.  They said I might need to know how to use some sort of coding languages to help balance the budget or something.  They said I'll also have to be able to help out other employees when they have technical issues with their computers or printers.

Would it be a good idea to negotiate to have my official title be something IT related so I can put it on my resume as relevant IT work (which I currently have none)?

To be honest, I'm really not sure what this job entails and I'm only doing it because I want to do something over the summer and CS internships are extremely limited where I live.

Thanks in advance."

I recently came across a job posting at a company that I interned before two years ago. I interned at that company for a year and left in good terms (The only reason why I stopped interning there because I wasn't allowed to intern there for more than a year. Company policy.). Their position that they posted is what I'm interested in and I meet about 90% of their requirements (They wanted two year experience for this role, but I only have one year and the experience was at this company.). 

My old boss has left the company since I interned there but the department where I interned at but the department manager who I'm in good terms with is still there. The CEO also knows me and is still working there.

My question: Aside from updating resume to reflect my current state, what should I include in my cover letter to that company? Also, should I email the department manager and CEO saying that I'm applying? 

Any advice and comments would be helpful!"
6eaqw3,3,2017-05-30,Lawyer early probation termination,helpthrowaway1235,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6eaqw3/lawyer_early_probation_termination/,"Hello legal advice I've come for some guidance. Currently I am on mail in probation for wet and reckless in the state of Florida. I don't live in Florida so I simply mail in a written report and call my officer once a month. I have been sentenced to probation for one year but currently am at my half way mark. My probation officer has no problem filing for early release of probation but told me to go through my lawyer if that's an option as if they file I could get a response in a day, week, month or never depending on the DA and Judge.

Well here is the problem although I have been sending updates to my lawyer through out my probation (payment of fines, written reports, and other proof of completion of special conditions) I have had a hard time getting in touch with him. I sent him an e-mail the beginning of the month letting him know that he could file in the middle of the month. It took almost a week of calling every day to even get an e-mail back in which he told me to remind him the day before. I told him okay and that I would send him an e-mail that day. Well fast forward and I send him an e-mail and don't hear anything back. I wait a few days and called last Friday trying to get in touch with him but could only get his receptionist. I figured that it being memorial day he couldn't file anything but I would at least like to know it's on his radar and it will be taken care of when he gets time. Well I spoke to my probation officer and set my next date and they even offered to file for me on their end but I told them I would make sure with my lawyer and I wanted to go that way. They didn't see anything in the court system for me but told me that my lawyer could also just speak to a judge in their chambers as well as it wasn't a huge issue. Well immediately after I called my lawyer and the receptionist told me he was out of the office the entire week.

At this point I'm a little frustrated. I paid this lawyer very good money to include everything from applying for early termination to later sealing/expunging my record when everything is completed. I understand that it's not a given that I will be given early termination of probation but it has already cost me a good internship. The situation has been on going for the last year and a half I understand there are consequences for my actions but prior to this I have not had any other trouble with the law. I am trying to put all this behind me but it seems like it almost won't go away. Is there anyway to tactfully speak to my lawyer or at least speak to another lawyer at the firm to at least get something going? Prior to the probation sentencing my lawyer was very quick in responding to phone calls or e-mails and now it's like pulling teeth. I know they're one of the best and are busy but I'm a paying client as well. What should I do?"

we decided to stay together and just have a long distance relationship during the week and i would come home and visit her and my family on the weekend. 

this is where it gets hard, so in college i sat across from this girl who i thought was absolutely beautiful, i would look forward each day to going to the class just to see her and hear her talk about things that blew her mind or cool stuff she was into or whatever, but i never thought i would talk to her. but not long after my crush started, in another class we did an excersize that caused her to come and talk to me, and we had an amazing but simple conversation. 

this little conversation lead to me sending her an email (because i didn't have her phone number and it was getting to the weekend) asking her if i could come to church with her, she was thrilled and then we ended up going and then going out for lunch afterwards. 

our friendship began to flourish and we got closer and closer, i even ended up staying at her house until 5 in the morning one night just talking to her and teaching her how to do the rubix cube. 

i believe she had feelings for me because of some of the things she said over text and the way she acted towards me and i deffinately had feelings for her, but being the idiot that i am i asked her if i could take her out on a date right after i had broken up with the girl i was dating and she said no because of that. 

well back to me being an idiot, i hardly talked to the girl i was crushing on for a while because we were on internships through school and while on this internship i got back together with the girl i broke up with and long story short i married her and got her prego and now we have a kid together.

i thought there for a while i was going to be able to move on and completely forgot about the crush i had on the girl, but then i saw a picture of someone who looked exactly like her and everything came rushing back and now i'm stuck because i feel like she's the ""one that got away"" but i don't want her to get away, but she won't talk to me.

TL;DR  i was dating someone, went to college and fell for someone else, played my cards all wrong and now i want a second chance with the girl i fell for but don't know how to make that happen or if it's even possible. halp."

I'm a fresh high school grad and I've been offered the choice between two internships. One is at a successful software dev company for the whole summer. It would be around $15 an hour and I would be working in QA (yes I know bottom of the ladder). The other is a 6 week internship at a Fortune 500 Aerospace company for $500 a week. They haven't told me exactly what I'll be doing besides gaining engineering work experiences, networking, community involvement, and interaction with executives. All of this is pretty vague to me. I applied for a software internship, but it's still not exactly clear what I'll be doing. As I just graduated I still don't know exactly what I want to do, but it's probably going to be in CS. My parents both want me to take the 6 week deal because it'll be close to their work and they view it as more prestigious, but I can drive myself and I think working at an actual software dev company would be more fun and relevant to my computer science major-plus they have great hours and benefits. Any advice would be appreciated."

GPA: 91%
SAT: 1400ish (just took it earlier this May, didn't feel like I did too well—aiming for 1500 in August)

My biggest plus is that I don't need financial aid. Aside from that, I think being Canadian helps a bit. I'll be able to get a TD Visa because my dad has a TAN, but I'm pretty sure I won't get in state tuition.

Honestly, I wasn't planning on applying to any US schools since Canadian ones are already pretty good and cheap, but my parents out of nowhere sprung on me that they're moving to California after I graduate, so I'd like to end up in the states. In addition, the good Canadian schools are getting pretty competitive too, so I'd like to maximize my chances of going somewhere good.

ECs are kinda weak. Treasurer in Key Club, President and Co-Founder of Programming Club, won a small programming competition, air cadets but left junior year, rugby and badminton player, school band, and I'm doing a CS internship this summer at University of Alberta. So yeah, I'm not too special with my extracurriculars.

I'm looking for quality CS schools and some of the more interesting programs like 3 2 engineering that I can't find in Canada. I'd prefer West Coast since my family will be in NorCal, but quality is priority. My ""fit"" I'd pretty flexible and I feel like I would be happy almost anywhere that has strong students and good professors. Thanks!!!"

6ebwwc,38,2017-05-30,Don't be Cartman,crankysysadmin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6ebwwc/dont_be_cartman/,"There's a certain segment of IT people I encounter over the years who seem to be saying ""Respect my authoritah!"" a la Cartman

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKjRMMU9HI

It's fairly common to have some IT guy getting red in the face arguing with people ""You can't have admin on your PC! It's not secure!""   ""I already bought you one of those you can't have another one!"" ""I'm not helping you with that go figure it out yourself!""

What leads to the Cartman-like behavior where you seem like a a little fat child yelling and waving your arms yet nobody cares? Typically an environment where you don't have much authority and try to exert it anyway.

One of the things that helps all of us is looking at how much ""authoritah"" we might have and recognizing it. Sometimes we have a lot less responsibility than we'd like. It's not really about what is fair, or what we wish we had, but more just the reality of the situation. 

Any time you get to the edge of where your responsibility ends, don't argue with people about that stuff. You need to instead approach this from another angle.

For example, I remember a case where someone posted on here about how he was an intern handing out headsets. Management had decided certain classes of employees got headsets to use on their PC with VOIP, and other classes of employees got VOIP phones. Our hero's job was to distribute this equipment.

Somehow he got into a back and forth bitch fight with some manager who insisted he wanted VOIP phones.

This is a perfect example of where you just don't have the conversation. If you're in that place you don't start arguing about something for which you have no control. You just tell the guy ""my job is to set these things up. I don't make decisions about who gets what or order anything so you're going to need to speak to $bosswithauthority"" and then if he insists you repeat it, and just move on. The problem comes in when someone like the IT guy distributing phones wants to be seen as having some level of power and fights about this stupid shit.

I'm a mid level manager so it's my job to sometimes take these issues a little further than the average sysadmin but there are limits on what I can do as well. I recently had a developer on another team who works for a bight VIP insist that he should be given an ubuntu server. We're a RHEL shop and we don't do that. I talk with him for a while and explain our reasoning, but that ultimately, he's going to get a RHEL server. He wants an exception. We have no management tools for Ubuntu since our security templates and monthly patch cycles and a million other things are developed around RHEL. he doesn't care. wants it anyway and says do it because VIP guy will make you. We've reached a point where my next option is to go Cartman on him but the better choice is to pawn him off to the next level because we've really reached the edge of my authority here.

Even in the small company. Lone IT guy sitting there. Nosy accounting manager sees two spare monitors in the IT storage closet. Says the monitors aren't doing anything and he wants one of them. IT guy says they're spares. Accounting manager says give it to me. At this point it isn't IT guy's monitor to give, so rather than pulling a Cartman, just pass it on up.

I think a lot of IT guys are afraid to seem weak or admit they don't have power in various situations. But you know what, you may just not have that power. 

If it is a case where it is within your responsibility, you don't end up doing the bitchy Cartman thing since it is within your responsibility. This crap only happens when you no longer have any authority over the situation."

Also, the last part was written before I graduated though I've already graduated some time ago. I'm still trying to think of a way to fix it! Thank you all in advance!

Here goes:
-----------------------------------------------------------

As an aspiring researcher in physical theory, I have chosen certain elective modules with a pronounced mathematical bias, in addition to those required for my degree; and these include modules such as General Relativity and String Theory. I have had relevant prior knowledge of complex analysis, fluid mechanics and in the various numerical methods; and have completed modules on Quantum Field Theory, and Quantum Mechanics.

In terms of computational experience I am also proficient in Mathematica, having utilised and applied it in most of my work, as well as in Fortran 95, which I have used for my final year project. I am familiar with Python and am planning to take up additional computing languages such as C++.

My final year project was completed under the supervision of (Professor A) from the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics group at (current institution). Our goal was to cool a levitated nanosphere to its motional ground state using cavity optomechanics with my project focusing on (…1 to 2 more sentences about project A).
In my third year of undergraduate studies, I embarked on a group project working with the same optomechanical set up in the AMO group with my supervisor (Professor B). The aim of the project was to explore the feasibilities of exploiting the ultrasensitive force sensing capabilities of the optomechanical setup as a means to (…detect something). Our group managed to show (this result) and further exploration was undertaken as a final year project for a fellow student.

In addition to those projects, I have completed a summer internship at (some institute) in (another country), wherein I was placed under the guidance of (Professors C and D) to work on (some quantum thing). They had shown that contextuality can still be observed despite a valid Kochen-Specker assignment of variables to the orthogonality graph using only 13 projectors. I managed to verify the results of their paper using Mathematica and wrote a report on how this was achieved by considering every possible outcome of 13 measurements to observe the violation of the non-contextual inequality. The remainder of my internship resulted in a report on the series of attempts to prove the conjecture that 13 projectors was the minimum number necessary to exhibit State-Independent Contextuality in three dimensions.

As part of this graduate programme, I hope to gain additional computational skills and further enhance my mathematical and analytical abilities while contemporaneously applying them to research. I believe that (this programme) would assist me in that aspect due to (reason1), and its flexibility to pursue some other course options from other fields of physics that I am interested in. Additionally, it encompasses many areas of research which match my interests, such as the project on (this topic), which would allow me to utilize my knowledge gained from various fields of physics, and (Professor so and so)’s research on (this topic) and (another similar topic), an area in which I already have had prior knowledge and experience. Upon completion of the programme, I plan to seek additional research opportunities in academia or apply my expertise into other industries. 

At present, I am on track to graduating with a GPA of 3.8 and am confident in my abilities to perform research in quantum physics.

On this coming Thursday, I am going to a Summer Welcome for my college, then we are going to a reunion at my grandma's house for her 80th birthday party, and then my mom and I are driving my truck down to Dallas for my internship. 

My question relates to moving my PC, two monitors, and keyboard. My other PC stuff will be with my laptop.

Here is the plan so far:

1. My mom and I will drive to my Summer Welcome with my clothes, bathroom supplies, and a few other things for me while I live in Dallas for six weeks. My laptop, headset, mouse, and mousepad will be in my cab (I have a supercab with foldout seats). 

At that time, my dad will be driving his work car, 2018 Ford Escape I believe, to my grandparents when he gets back. He is going to drive my computer, two monitors, and keyboard. I have the boxes for my monitors and keyboard, but I don't have a big enough box for my PC. The case is an NZXT Phantom 410. I am thinking about wrapping it in a thick blanket or two and tape the folds.

He will put that stuff in the back row of the car as there is no trunk. 

2. At my grandparents house, we are going to transfer my computer stuff to my truck which has a long bed. I am thinking about putting my PC and monitors in my bed along with the suitcases of clothes and bathroom supplies and keeping the keyboard with my laptop and stuff in the cab.

Is there anything wrong with the plan that I can fix? Don't worry about the GPU and Hyper 212, I will take those out as well and they will be in the cab too. 

Thank you in advance and if you need something clarified, please let me know.

EDIT: My truck is a 2008 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab with a long bed."

I'm a 21M senior in mechanical engineering w/ a computer science minor at a top 15 school in USA.



I have a great GPA and am good at speaking with people and communicating in general. Also, contrary to the stereotype, I really ENJOY conversing with people and sharing ideas. I am also super adventurous, am not at all tied down to a location or area post-graduation, and would love to spend a portion of my job traveling. I speak English and Russian fluently and Spanish competently. As far as career interests go, I am really into medical device design, exoskeleton design, general product design, etc. However, I am very willing to be flexible with the job's industry if the job benefits best fit my personality.



I am afraid that my degree and minor may lead me to a desk job with little variety and excitement. I experienced just that during an internship and found that if I wasn't incredibly passionate about the work I was doing, I eventually grew to dread waking up every morning for my commute. The purpose behind this post is to get a sense of what kind of jobs I should look to apply to in the fall that will keep me satisfied and interested.

6edg8l,17,2017-05-31,a long post about wanting to quit,quittingthrowaway579,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6edg8l/a_long_post_about_wanting_to_quit/,"warning in advance: this is gonna be a really long rant and I apologize/thank you in advance for reading. i'm having a major case of the quits, and I just need some place to get my thoughts down on paper.

situation: i'm a rising 3rd yr phd student in history at a very good (think top 20, if that matters to you) program here in the US. 3rd yr at my program is exams/ dissertation proposal writing/ finishing whatever coursework you didn't get to finishing yet year. after that, it's dissertation research plus writing. so I feel like if I proceed forward after third year, I'm locked in for the duration. I know technically I'm not, but this is the last ~natural point of departure.

problem 1: my heart isn't in this. and to be quite honest, my head isn't either. it's not that I'm not hearts-and-stars PASSIONATE about my dissertation project, because I'm not that kind of person; I worry, rather, that I'm not actually that interested in it. I'm interested in it as much as I need to in order to progress through the program, but I don't ever find myself curious enough about it to go the extra mile. it's a cool intellectual puzzle, and when I'm in the archives I enjoy trying to put the different pieces together, but there's nothing really compelling me to it beyond that. idk, maybe there doesn't need to be? my family argues that it's just a project I have to do so I can get to the real reward, which is the PhD in three years. which brings me to...

problem 2: I've never wanted to go into academia. I came to grad school thinking that at least I'd get to do challenging, interesting work, and have a degree at the end I could use for other things. for a really long time I was set on archives, which I have some experience with. but archives, for example, has its own credential, the MLIS, and an increasingly important set of skills that have to be mastered, aka, digital archives. I know internships are a thing— but I had very bad luck last year when I did one at my current institution, as there was no infrastructure in place for grad assistants and mostly led to me doing file entry and mail sorting, and I've been a little wary of them since.

so there is part of me, basically, that thinks that if I want a job outside of academia so badly, and the PhD itself no longer appeals to me, then maybe I should spend the next three years doing training that will actually get me that job, rather than trying to do a PhD that I'm not interested in and attempting to get bootleg credentials on the side.

problem 3: on the other hand, that's making a very definite choice, where the PhD could potentially (? idk) have more options depending. also, then I'll never have the PhD credential, which could (this is my family's argument, see problem 4), ~open doors for me later. finally, there's a corporation down the road from me that has a track record of hiring history PhDs, so my honest guess is that if I stay in the program, I'll end up working for them, which would be a very good job and I would probably enjoy it well enough. why would I turn that opportunity down? why would I turn down the chance to have a fully-funded PhD in my back pocket? (see problem 7). 

problem 4: idk what you guys could do to help on this one, but my family, who I am very close to, is *intensely* committed to me finishing this program. I had doubts about grad school even when I was applying to it. by contrast, my family has never had any doubts. they believe, very strongly, that getting the PhD (and more crucially, the post-PhD job) is what will make me happy. I think me leaving this program would break their hearts. I don't know how to fix this. 

problem 5: I feel very anxious thinking about dissertation research &amp; writing. every time I think about it I get the most awful slamming feeling in my chest. I don't want to leave the PhD program because I feel anxious about finishing, but I worry that maybe this is all an elaborate ruse and the real reason I want to quit is because of my anxiety, which would somehow be worse, like I'm giving into it. 

problem 6: I'm not even interested in history anymore. I was at the bookstore the other day and I picked up a book on Carthage (not my field but I've always liked roman history) and then immediately set it down. I don't go to museums or watch documentaries or read history in my spare time. I don't enjoy thinking about it or talking about it; I find myself turned off to it. the whole thing. 

problem 7: I don't hate my program. I don't hate my advisor, even though he could stand to answer his emails more frequently. I don't hate my department. I get to do research in foreign countries and most of it is paid for by other people. my professors think I'm doing well. I have no student loan debt whatsoever; I had a full ride to undergrad and a fully funded program here. I cried every day my first semester because I hated it so much, but I haven't cried in the parking garage in a long time. I live in a shitty town in a state I'd never voluntarily live in, but I've gotten to make it work.  one of my friends said that if I really wanted to leave grad school, I'd've left already, so there must be *something* keeping me here. me, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I believe in finishing what you start, but everything is such a slog to muck through and I feel like I'm only doing it because other people believe I should. I myself don't know what I'd do or what I want. I feel like I'd regret leaving and I feel like I'd regret staying. because I'm not bottomed-out miserable — just deeply unsatisfied — I wonder if that means I should stay.

I would be taking up course work as an undergrad to complete a minor in Computer Science, with a Mechanical Engineering major.

I have completed the following:

* Algorithms, 
* Data Structures
* An app production course (in android). 

This summer I'd be interning at a software company as a support intern (with some coding involved).

I'm a junior at a state school that I don't think most have heard of and I have a 2.8 GPA currently with no internships. I have a few projects on GitHub under my belt working with Android and some APIs. I have two years left in my undergrad before I go out into industry.

I recently had an interview at a company for an IT intern position to hold me over while I tried to search for software engineering internships for next summer. I tried to be myself during the interview while being as approachable and friendly as possible. I also had a reference and the interviewer told me it went great, but I was passed over for some other candidates. Going forward, I'd like to try and improve my chances in landing internships and I wanted to know if currently if I am employable at all.

I have taken my DS class that included basic algorithms and data structures such as hash maps and I will be taking my algorithm analysis class this upcoming fall semester. Aside from that, I've been focusing on my soft skills and it helped me do well in that interview recently. I am mostly worried whether or not I'll be able to get a job after uni and if I can even maintain my employability after that. I might be focusing too hard into the future, but I'm thinking that what I'm doing isn't enough. My dream would be to land a job after uni in Seattle where most of my family and friends live currently. 

Right now, I'm focusing on a physics class that I'm taking this summer and I'll be traveling with family before I kick it into high gear for the rest of uni so I can graduate with more than a 3.0 GPA. I plan on trying for two internships before I graduate so I can have the best chance of being employed. I've read other threads about what I can do to improve my chances, but it hasn't helped me calm my worrying, it just adds to the stress overall. Am I doing enough or do I need to do more in order to have a secure job at the end of uni?"

It's an interdisciplinary degree with some literature, politics, history, sociology, IT, and I guess my main qualification is that I speak German, English and French fluently. I had several internships but none in any bigger firms. 

My problem is, now I'm not so sure which jobs to look for since I only seem somewhat qualified for most of them. I know that you don't have to fit the profile 100% but I still find it difficult. 

My complicating factor is, while I'm not scared of moving in cities that I don't know, I have an SO with whom I intend spend my future. He is in a highly specialised field and working on a university career which will mean moving every few years. We work okay with long distance but it's making me sad to spend so little time with him, also in terms of mariage/kids/house an LDR is not practical. 

His next move is coming up at the end of the year but he doesn't know where he will go yet. We'll only find out after October. I'm looking for a job now and want to get a good start. I don't have many aspirations but I'm having trouble defining goals in terms of what kind of job I want. 

I'm good at: 

- functioning under stress

- creative problem solving

- organising stuff

- being diplomatic

- paying attention to detail (proof reading and stuff like that)


I'm okay at: 

- socialising

- being creative 

- maths


I have no experience/am not good at:

- sales 

- jobs that only involve talking to people

I'm told I give good advice but I don't enjoy teaching and being in the spotlight. I do okay at it though. My grades were also okay but not great.

6eevun,6,2017-05-31,Statement of Purpose Critique,DwarvenAxes,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/6eevun/statement_of_purpose_critique/,"Hello all,

I'm looking at starting to submit my applications for grad school this coming August/September. I was hoping that some of you lovely people would take a moment and critique the essay I am working on. The bulk of it can be used for different schools, but some of it specific to the one I really want to get into. Names and my school have been removed for sake of privacy.

[

When I graduated from [Alma Mater] in December 2016 I had no idea what I wanted to do. I received two degrees, one in Creative Writing and one in Media/Communications. While I love speaking in front of people, creating, writing, and consuming media, being a part of the back end with marketing, advertising, social media, and PR is not what I want for my career.

However, through an internship and subsequent full time position, I did find something that I loved: teaching and advising the interns who became my responsibility. They were so enamored with a field I cannot see myself doing.

That was in February, and I had missed every single deadline and I had yet to take the GRE. I waffled; did I really want to go back to school? Did I want to write papers again? Did I want to subject myself to an endless barrage of people critiquing my writing again? Did I want to teach undergrads? The answer to all of those is an emphatic yes. 

[Alma Mater] was my school for three years; I enjoyed every Literature class I took, every fiction workshop, even my poetry technique course. The English Department includes some of my favorite professors, and a few of my favorite authors. While I never had the pleasure of taking a class with [Name Redacted] or [Name Redacted], I did take classes with [Name Redacted] and [Name Redacted], and with each one my writing improved and my style was honed. The professors on staff are an eclectic mix of writers and have writing styles I relate to.

Writing has always been and will continue to be my passion. I’ve been making up stories since I could speak, my mother will tell you all about them. I write every day and I want to be able to pursue it in a more focused capacity. While, it has never been a focus on getting published, it’s always been a dream on the farther reaches of my goals.

The proudest moment I’ve had was getting one of my stories published. It was in the Tallahassee Community College magazine, and isn’t one of the greatest things I’ve written. Since that point, I’ve causally submitted work, but this year I’ve made a goal to submit something for publication at least once a month. So far, I’ve gotten great feedback and it’s helping to improve my writing.

[Alma Mater] is my Alma Mater, and I would love to be able to come back for my Masters of Fine Arts. It took me a minute to find what I wanted to do, but this is where I see myself. I want to work with the professors who I didn’t have the chance to the first time, I want to take time and get feedback to improve my writing, and I want to be able to help improve undergraduate writers. It doesn’t take an MFA to get published, but it does to teach.

]

I'm hoping to get some publications before I actually apply, but no such luck. And, having spoken with grad admissions for the department, it seems like they are less focused on having publications than others that I'm applying to.

As far as this goes though, am I not focusing enough on the school itself, and why I want to go back? Also, is it reading too much like a narrative and less like a statement of purpose? I was shooting for something a bit more creative, as I am applying for an MFA in creative writing. At this point I've been looking at it for about a month so I'm barely reading it anymore.

Thank you all!"

Having never had basic programming experience I can understand the concepts covered in class and usually understand the clicker questions presented in class, but I seize-up and spend hours on even the most basic homework tasks, going nowhere. I've been spending at least two to three hours per day for the past two weeks trying book exercises and looking up Youtube tutorials trying to learn independently, because I genuinely do not want to mooch off of others.

The one thing is I took it in java since I wanted to learn more java (the internships I have had all have to do with Java, including the one I am doing this summer). I hear the courses at UTD are in C++ though. Should I take the credit?

If I should, what should I teach myself over the summer to learn what I need to learn for CS II at UTD (I know I get what I pay for at Collin)? If not, then why (I ask this so people who are in the same situation as me in the future can reference this)? 

Edit: I'm not a transfer student, I just took this stuff as concurrent enrollment in high school (I'm a senior right now about to graduate).


Edit 2 (extra info): This is before any comments are posted if that matters. I think some people will say it is desirable for me to have a knowledge of many programming languages including C++, but I already know a fair amount of C++ (e.g. sorting and reading/writing to files level) since I dabble in Arduino and ESP8266 projects in my spare time, both of which require good knowledge of C++ (and I use PlatformIO as my IDE so I don't piggyback off of libraries all the time for these things which take away from my knowledge)"

6eg8jq,122,2017-05-31,What you should do if you have no extracurricular activities,novembrr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6eg8jq/what_you_should_do_if_you_have_no_extracurricular/,"Are you a rising junior who is panicking because you have no extracurricular activities?

I've seen a lot of you guys on r/ApplyingToCollege!

First, examine your life to really ascertain if you ""do nothing"" in your free time. Besides the typical extracurricular activities (debate, Key Club, soccer), there are TONS of things you might be doing in your free time that don't feel like extracurricular activities but can be extracurricular activities to list on your college apps.

For example, do you do any of the following?

Extracurricular activities for those who ""don't have any ECs"":

* Reading
* Building things/tinkering
* Helping siblings (significant childcare, tutoring, or carpooling)
* Helping grandparents (helping them pay the bills, run errands, take their medicine, do chores)
* Participating in a church youth group or in a religious ceremony each week
* Any sort of job, including working in a family business
* Learning languages
* Hiking
* Yoga
* Attending a just-for-fun summer camp
* Running in your free time
* Drawing
* Babysitting
* Coding
* Knitting
* Gardening
* Scrapbooking
* Riding your bike
* Walking the neighbor's dog every day
* Helping your elderly neighbor with household tasks or errands
* Caring for a sick or disabled family member
* Playing the guitar
* Playing boardgames
* Playing ultimate frisbee
* Skiing/snowboarding/other outdoor sports
* Fishing
* Writing short stories or poetry
* Conducting science experiments 
* Working on a farm

All of those could count if you spend a significant amount of time each month doing them! If you've fished once in your life, however, that doesn't count as an extracurricular activity. Think of things that are recurring each week or each month of the last few years.

Don't have any summer plans? Make some! There are tons of cool things you can do this summer that don't involve spending a ton of money, applying to exclusive programs, etc.

Don't believe me? List your interests and I'll give you some ideas. 

For example, a student who likes art and wants to study neuroscience? There are TONS of local community programs or group homes for the disabled; call a few of them and ask them if you can conduct a few art classes with the people there!

Like social change and volunteering? Don't just volunteer at the soup kitchen, lead a task force of your friends to paint over graffiti in the nearest big city. If you speak with your local mayor or the business owner of the place with graffiti, they might even green light you guys to paint a mural there. Not only do you have an awesome summer activity, but you now have leadership experience.

Interested in computer science but did nothing at all to prepare for a major in it? Not only do some libraries and community centers offer coding summer programs for free (my library does!), but ask if you can volunteer each week to teach the elderly or unemployed folks computing skills. Or see if your local library or community center will give you a space for free and help you advertise a coding bootcamp for kids, which you can lead to share your passion for CS and gain leadership experience.

Like aerospace engineering or aviation but finding it impossible to get hands-on experience with the aerospace and aviation industries? Google ""aviation museum"" and you might drum up somewhere where you can volunteer. Search for small regional airports and approach the airport manager. Ask if you can do some grunt work. Google ""flight schools [your city]"" and either start taking classes (cost prohibitive for some students) or, again, ask if you can do some grunt work around the office. Live near a major airport? There will be tons of offices for airlines in your vicinity. Approach them about a possible summer internship; sure, it's not the same as working at NASA this summer, but it gets something pertaining to the industry on your resume.

Passionate about medicine/nursing but you already volunteer at the hospital? Ask around to see if a disabled child in your area needs a helper/someone who will play with them each week throughout the summer. Or see if any local dentist offices conduct free health care clinics for the homeless and ask if you can volunteer there, as well. Organize a task force of students and now you have leadership experience. 

If you want any personalized suggestions, let me know your interests and I can toss some ideas at you! I'm happy to help.

Require Help.,sharmilabalak,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6egja6/shy_indian_guy_trying_to_break_out_of_his_shell/,"Hello redditors of India, 21 yr old, Shy guy a.k.a Sharmila Balak speaking here. I need a bit of dating advice or just advice in general related to women/girls. 

I have been introverted or shy for as long as I can remember. What I've increasingly begun to realise is that I've had no experience with girls and women my entire life upto this point. I'm straight btw. I do despise this and want to change this now. My life story in brief till now.

Till age 15 I spent my time living in the beautiful city of Mumbai. In high school, I remember discovering pornography and begin to like girls. Although I never acted upon those desires. I never asked a girl out or engaged in texting, which was a rage back then and which was how you came into contact wih girls. Consequently even in a metro city like Mumbai, I ended up with zero experience with the fairer sex. Note that, I can talk to women normally, like make banter or idle chit-chat but am still clueless from a romantic point of way.

The years 15-17 were spent preparing for the dreaded JEE, enough said, I certainly didn't get some during this phase. And oh also neither did I make it to IIT, I got into BITS instead.

Coming to college, I remember initially that I definitely did entertain the thought of getting a girlfriend, the logical thing to do in college, right ? But for whatever reasons, I found programming and engaged in relentless pursuit of my academic endeavors. I have realised that I've used that as an excuse to not approach women at all. And have come to sadly realise that I didn't approach them because I didn't know how to ? I was inexperienced hence I didn't approach women and I didn't approach women because I was inexperienced. See the Catch-22 situation here ?

This is what plagues my existence right now. The sheer inexperience I have in matters pertaining to romance. To make matters even worse, I had a personal tragedy while I was in college, my mother passed away out of the blue. Which made me even more of a recluse and not seek the company of women. I have literally zero experience in pursuing women or romantic relationships. Shouldn't come as a surprise that I haven't even kissed until now. I have a grand total of 2 women's phone numbers one of who was a colleague during an internship and another an old-school friend who I suspect might be interested in me.

I am looking for some concrete steps so that I can pursue and fulfill my romantic desires. I will start of with these questions -

1. How does dating actually work in India ? I have been a consumer of popular TV shows of all kinds, I am certain you can't approach random women on street and ask them out lest you want to be labelled as a creep. 

2. How do I go about expressing my romantic interest in girls/women ? How do I start off ?

3. Say I'm friends with a girl, how does the whole process of ""making one a girlfriend work"" in India ? Do you actually propose a.k.a confess your pretentious love before you date ?

4. At what point do I ask a woman who I might be interested in for her number (definitely not right off the bat) ? 

5. Do guys feel insecure about approaching women ? Do you only approach someone who might say yes ?

All of these questions should pretty much tell you that I'm a bit socially handicapped. People are afflicted with various diseases, me I'm afflicted with the condition of having zero experience with women. I am an adult for all purposes for now, I will soon be getting a job, I desperately want to change this situation.

I'm an ordinary guy. I work out, am hygienic etc. I respect women, I wish I'd just be a bit more open around people and more specifically with women. I'm looking for help.

Caveat, understand that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. I'm genuinely looking for help, please stay to the point and avoid jokes, memes etc.

Thanks/Dhanyavaad."

As a result, I am an ECE major with dual minors in CS/Math. I feel that this was the correct choice, as didn't learn much from the 4 CS courses I took (I've been programming for awhile). I just finished my junior year with a cumulative GPA of 3.96.

I am very interested in software involving computer vision, autonomous robotics, and data science. I think that as far as experience goes, I'm in a very good spot, because all of my work/research is very relevant to this path. By the time I graduate, I will have completed two software engineering internships (the first was a big data analytics internship for a decent DoD contractor, the second is machine vision and autonomous robotics at Lockheed Martin), as well as ~2 years of research on autonomous robotics and image processing (lots of very complex projects of which I was the sole developer, and a journal publication etc). 

I have been self-studying software design for a pretty long time, and as a result feel like I can easily keep up with most CS majors, especially in C/C++, Python, Java, UNIX (also, Matlab, Swift, and Scala, but those are typically not my go to languages) in ordinary programming tasks. What makes me a bit uneasy is *not* interview questions on data structures/algorithms or relating to image processing / machine learning. It's the questions on everything else.

I pulled down my school's CS curriculum when I started college, and have been trying to self-study through the important classes I haven't had time to take (OS, programming paradigms, and the advanced algorithms class for the most part). That being said, there are a few areas of CS that I feel a bit uncomfortable with outside of the basics, such as parallel programming (understand basic POSIX threads etc but have never done much with it) and databases (I know a little SQL, but my internship was on a hadoop platform).

I'm wondering if it would be a better use of my time to study these subjects that are arguably less directly relevant to my desired career path than continue building on existing ML/data science knowledge I have. The reason why I have self-studied so much is because these areas are difficult to get into straight out of college, and I am not sure that I can afford to pay for grad school immediately.

 I would love a second opinion."

Is the internship hunt over? I really don't want to work at a part-time job so I'm wondering what can I do for money during the summer. I just finished taking Data Structures so I consider myself proficient in Java. I really want to do something CS or IT related this summer so I can do something to further my skills. 
6ei1in,2,2017-05-31,High School Internship Abroad,Qvbreugel,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/6ei1in/high_school_internship_abroad/,"Hello,

I'm a 16 year old boy from the Netherlands. I'm currently in High School and in American terms, next year I will be a sophomore. I've chosen for bilingual education and in order to receive my diploma for this I'm required to do an international internship next year. For this internship there's only one requirement: It has to be at a company where English is the main language. 

Here comes my problem. I really want to go to the United States because I would like to move there and live there. I just haven't been able to find anything for my age. My interests are computers and I have some programming experience. Of course it would be great if I could do something in that direction but it doesn't have to. Even delivering donuts to a police station would be sufficient for me (Seriously a guy did that last year for his internship). 

Unlike other classmates I do not have family or friends living in the United States. Hopefully some of you have some tips or ideas because I've been looking for about 6 months now and I'm completely stuck. 

Thanks in advance,

Quinten"

I know TRON takes MTE 140 and SYDE take SYDE 223, but what are the other ""algorithms and data structures"" courses taken by each program? "

Not like ""I interviewed at a couple places but messed up on the interview questions"", more like I didn't get a single interview offer. I feel like I've put myself so far behind by not taking advantage of any of the opportunities at my school and now I'm panicking that I'm screwing myself up on my chances for an internship next summer.
I know that junior summer is typically the time where you need the internship, but every one of my friends in CS has an internship this summer, and I feel like I'm making myself non-competitive by not getting one. I do pretty good (I think) in classes with a 3.81 GPA, and I have a job set up next semester that's kind of like a TA/tutor, but I'm just really nervous about job prospects with the career fair in september.
I really just need some reassurance that I'm ok or guidance on what I can do. Really anything to calm me down would be nice, thanks "

Some background: just graduated college, and have an internship at a certain big name credit card company paying me $27 an hour to do some quality assurance for software. 

I was undeclared my first 2 years, but had taken a couple computer science classes, so I just decided to declare a information technology major. I enjoyed the work, as stressful as it could be, sometimes hated it, but I'm happy I graduated.

Throughout highschool and my first two years of college I wanted to be in the healthcare field; think nurse (male), physical therapy, etc. It still creeps in my mind that I want to do those. What stopped me was I didn't know I could handle the course load in college, since I wasn't a good student in highschool. But I became a fantastic student after my first semester, graduating with a 3.5 GPA despite getting a 2.5 my first semester because of depression. 

Anyways, I hate the office life. Cubicles are draining my soul, as well as other typical rat race type stuff like traffic, etc... the work in my internship isn't as interesting as my school work either, and it's very disappointing tbh. 

If anyone could share their story/advice, I thank you.

TL;DR just graduated, hate office life, thinking of other careers, need advice"

But, I'm worried that it isn't the right career choice- I've got the right skillset for it (strong interpersonal and business skills coupled with good coding skills) but my parents absolutely hate the idea of taking on a more business oriented role. They're worried that I'll make less, get promoted slower, be the first to be at risk during layoffs, have less prestige, so on. I don't know nearly enough about PMs internally to say whether any of these concerns are valid.

I like the idea of being a PM but I've got some serious doubts now after hearing my parents' concerns.
Does anyone have experience being at this cross road of their CS career? Any insight? "
6ej12o,3,2017-05-31,First week at internship - anonymously invited to fetish group?!,weird1stweek,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6ej12o/first_week_at_internship_anonymously_invited_to/,"I’m a female student at a major US university, majoring in computer science. My first week at my software development internship was going great, until Thursday. When I walked into my cubicle that morning, there was a note left under my keyboard in a place that only someone sitting down could see it. The note was written in capital letters in pen, and said “JUST IN CASE YOU’RE CURIOUS” followed by a hyperlink to a fetish website. It also said to join a group that is the same as the (relatively unusual) name of a kink group on my university’s campus. 

When I found this note I was afraid and shocked. Not only that someone would have the audacity to invite me to a sexual fetish group at work, but also that they would be creepy enough to do it by anonymously sneaking into my cubicle. For the rest of the day I tried to put it out of my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I decided that I would figure out whoever did this so I can stop it in the future.

However, there are some problems: a lot of people in my office have gone to my university. In addition, I had just been introduced to the whole office along with the other interns at a big meeting, so everyone in the workplace knows who I am and where I go to school. I’m the only female intern and the office overall is about 80 to 90% male, so I’m an easy target with many possible suspects. I’ve tried researching the fetish group but they (for obvious reasons) have no membership roster or publicity information except for trying to get people to come to meetings. My internet research did not yield much, and thinking about this situation was making me anxious. On Friday afternoon, I resorted to an old family tradition to ward off bad luck (ayin hara/evil eye) and drew a round eye on some notebook paper and stuck it where the note had been. (I am not usually superstitious but I was kind of freaked out bc I still didn’t know what was going on.)

When I came back to work on Tuesday, there was a question mark drawn on the backside of the little eye. So someone (presumably the same person?) snuck into my cubicle again…At this point, I don’t know what to do. I want to figure out who is doing this so I can avoid being around them. Though I do feel harassed, I don’t want to take it to management and become a problem my second week on the job. I haven’t told anyone about this, I have saved both the first note and the eye drawing, I have not visited the hyperlink yet and I still haven’t talked to many people around the office so that’s where I’m at. 

If you have any tips on how to figure out what’s going on/who’s responsible, if this is harassment or I’m overreacting, what course of action I should follow, or if you have been in a similar situation, please give some advice because this is a really weird way to start my internship."
