luugu7,2,2021-02-28,Going from a Help Desk Monitor to IT Internship -- Any advice for my interview?,StonedCatalyst,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/luugu7/going_from_a_help_desk_monitor_to_it_internship/,"Hi Reddit,

Been feeling that imposter syndrome lately, and I'm getting ready for the biggest interview of my life. Looking for any helpful advice from all of you IT gods.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent most of high school learning programming, networking, and basic IT. I grabbed a Microsoft Software MTA and C# along the way, while almost getting my A+. I've never come from money, so I took a year off school--working and saving money to put myself through a semester in college (Electronics, PC Basics, Cisco Networking), right as the pandemic hit. Then I lost my position via furlough, had to change housing, and then picked up a remote Help Desk Job as my first IT gig, albeit that this is a LIGHT IT gig (mainly data analyst on user activity).

Now, with my certs getting ready to expire, and me desperately needing to acquire a job that funds my education, I have an interview in three days with for an IT internship position at a huge company. I've been talking with them over the phone for about a month now, and I'm getting ready for a two hour interview and a tour for their 40-story building that runs heavily off of automation. They only have one IT Analyst overlooking the whole plant and I would be his assistant, covering most of the grunt work, while he would deal with big picture issues.

&amp;#x200B;

This position is a dream job for me because it requires that I attend school, and will give me flexible hours to work around my schooling schedule. I'll also be able to learn from this seasoned IT professional and get help to really flesh out my career path. My only concern is if I'm really cut out for the job, and how do I stand out to my interviewers when I've never had an actual hands-on IT position in the past?

&amp;#x200B;

This field is my absolute passion and drive in life, and I hope to be able to express that to my interviewers, but am second guessing my abilities as the date gets closer and closer. Also, I'm sure that I'm not the only one interviewing for the job, and am worried that someone more qualified might look like a better investment for them. Any advice for the interview?

Thank you all in advance

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Got the position! Thank you for all of your advice!"
luuyih,5,2021-02-28,Been applying to internships since last November and nothing but rejection,5yearpastdue-alt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/luuyih/been_applying_to_internships_since_last_november/,"I'm a junior CS student at my current university set to graduate in May of 2022. I transferred in from a local junior college in August of 2020 with an Associate Degree in Mathematics. I was a CS major at that school as well but I ended up picking up an AS while doing my coursework to transfer. I have a 3.5 overall GPA and 4.0 major GPA.

I've been applying to software engineering and data science internships since last November and I have only gotten one interview but ultimately got rejected. At this point I have probably applied to roughly 100 different companies large and small and received nothing. I just feel defeated at this point and like I'm not going to get anything ever from industry despite the countless hours applying, tweaking my resume with the help of others in my field, and writing cover letters.

I've worked on a research project at my university since September of 2020 where I work with Python, large SQL databases, Microsoft Azure, REST API, and anything else that is required of me. Through this I have realized my love for data science as that is the nature of most of the work I do and likely where I want my career to be.

I was recently offered a paid project lead position on my research project as my project lead is leaving to do other graduate research. I was told he pushed hard for me to be his replacement. This is a position that would normally be held by a graduate student and would have me leading a project of undergraduates and graduate students.

Would this position be as good as having an industry data science internship when I graduate and ultimately seek a position in industry? If not would it at least be enough for me to get my foot in the door? I really like this research project, the work I do, and the people and technology I work with. I just want to make sure that committing to it full time over the summer would be worth it instead of continuing to search for something in industry.

Thank you in advance for any help. I'm mentally burn out and just want to make the best decision I can."

Graduated with a BSME in 3 years, didn't spend any time reflecting on if I enjoyed the major or not, and have now spent the last 9 months working in a position that I do not enjoy at all.  I've strongly enjoyed the few programming courses I took in highschool and college, on top of learning java and js on my own time, and am strongly considering switching over to computer science.  It seems like I have three main options to make the switch:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bootcamp (Pros: structure, connections/easier job placement after graduating, cons: $17k)
2. Master's in Comp Sci (Pros: Really the only way to learn the ins and outs to be truly prepared, Cons: Time and Money) 
3. Rigorous self study + portfolio projects then shoot for entry level jobs or even an internship to get my feet wet

luz3nj,72,2021-02-28,"Advice/Thoughts on attending a ""highly competitive"" pre med school as someone who attended as an adult",A2Cposterthrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/luz3nj/advicethoughts_on_attending_a_highly_competitive/,"I've been reading discussion on this forum for the last few months helping a family member navigate the insanity that is admissions. This stems from my experience taking classes at UW Seattle, but also working at (and talking to undergrads) at similarly competitive and regarded schools such as GA Tech, UCSD, and UT Austin. 

**Should you attend a ""highly competitive"" university?** 

I think these types of schools are for a very speficic type of person. I don't think you can complete your education without any setbacks, so I would only recommend that you attend one of these schools if you can handle stress well. Furthermore, mental health resources are severely lacking at many of these schools, they exist, but they don't meet demand, or even come close. 

If you don't feel confident in your ability to navigate a sea of students, then also, don't come to a competitive school. But, if you feel confident in your work ethic (remember, if you get in, you have the sufficient academic ability), I think some of these schools are great options, and offer an excellent, affordable education, along with some of the greatest faculty and opportunities anywhere in the world. 

**Advice for people who do plan to attend these universities:** 

As someone who has seen multiple examples of students who earn good grades, and who did earn a 3.85 at one of these schools myself, here are some things you absolutely should do before coming to one. 

1. **Research how the grading works BEFORE starting!**  
UW grades every pre med weeder class (except calc based physics) on a curve -- meaning a 95% could be a B- if it's the median grade! So many students don't know this, think they're doing B+ or A- level, then get shocked when they get a 2.4 or something. Georgia Tech doesn't do A-'s and A+'s, I believe, it's all just A, B, C etc. 
2. **To succeed, you need to do things that other students won't do!**  
If you're an average student, you'll get ""bad"" (i.e. not pre-med level, B/B-) grades. So, you need to do things the average student won't do. And, we're talking about the average UW/UCSD/UT student - the average student most certainly does all their homework, and studies for tests. If you don't do these things, you'll be at the bottom of the class. You have to go above and beyond - go to office hours, post questions on discussion boards, go to every review session offered, do every practice question that's given. Study for tests a week in advance. You'll be told these things a million times, but most people don't realize that it's not easy to be above average. After all, everyone was above average (often by a lot!) in high school. 
3. **Form study groups!**  
In a lab, you're always collaborating. Doctors definitely consult each other about various cases and diagnoses. Software Engineers ask for help when they need it. So, why do students want to study alone? In my honest opinion, I don't think you can possibly do these schools alone, they were never meant to be done alone. 
4. **Participate outside of class!**  
If you come here, sit in your lectures, pass your exams, and simply get your degree, you've wasted 95% of your tuition. You're paying tens of thousands of dollars for all the resources you have at your disposal. You have experts in so many fields, and even the least prominent research labs at these institutions are working on cool projects and publishing in great journals. If you don't participate in outside of class opportunities, you might as well go to a community college, there's less stress, and you'll probably learn the material better anyways. 
5. **Use your TA's.**  
Often, they're the best at explaining concepts. It's a 20 person discussion section, please actually show up. 

 That's all. These schools seem to get a bad rep for having brutal deflation, and for large classes (both true), but I don't think people notice the pros enough. An excellent academic reputation, amazing research opportunities, cutting edge research and world class faculty. To close this out, I'd like to share an anecdote. A student in my lab was interested in computer science, so she took the first most basic computer science class offered, and scored something around a mid to high C. Later that summer, she applied to various labs and companies in positions involving CS/technology, and got a wide array of interviews, and was quite literally told that they had no doubt about her knowledge of the basics of CS because of where she took the CS class. She got an internship and excelled. 

No one is looking at a 4.0 from Full Sail and a 3.6 from UW or UCSD and saying ""well, guess the 4.0 wins"". People do recognize the rigor of a lot of schools, and believe it or not, it does actually amount to opportunities!"
luzce3,1,2021-02-28,Just Another College Student Bitching about Life Needs Help Getting Somewhere,44theshadow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/luzce3/just_another_college_student_bitching_about_life/,"Hello all. I'm sorry I can't offer a unique situation to intrigue you all. In fact, I'd call my situation painfully pedestrian. I'd just like to ask some advice of you guys if your willing to put up with my whining. I'm no writer, so this is all just incohesive thoughts.

A rundown of my academic situation is this: I'm a college junior studying Mechanical Engineering. I don't enjoy hardly any of the classes with exception of the design related ones. I don't have a job, an internship offer, or hardly any real experience under my belt. I do have a higher up position at a fraternity, but it isn't related to the field I want to get into. My GPA is mediocre a mediocre 3.08, and given the amount of time I put into my studies, this really should be higher. I applied to 150+ companies these past few months, and I didn't get a single internship/co-op offer. It feels like no club/company wants to touch me with a 10-foot pole, and I feel its because I didn't get any meaningful technical experience since highschool. 

The main reason for that is because in highschool, I had a place I could call my own. In any moment of free time I'd tinker, eat, and brainstorm in that space. I accomplished a great deal in that room, but you couldn't really call it engineering. But in college, there's no such place. Despite the fact the college I go to is one of the best engineering schools in the country, none of the facilities want anything to do with me. That is the general attitude at these places. They want you to go in, do the thing, and fuck off. It doesn't help that the machines are deafeningly loud and if used wrong could kill you in an instant. Usually, I'd be fine with this. Its not like I was allowed into the highschool facilities at first either. But I was almost always so exhausted from classes that even if I had free time, I couldn't commit to any personal project, much less put up with the dickheads that run these facilities who look and act as miserable as I do. Or I suppose I could, but I'm always so tired by just the littlest of things. I feel I'm a bit shit out of luck in this aspect.

From a social perspective: I'm pretty miserable. In highschool, I sacrificed all of my social time and dedicated it to ''engineering'' and studying. This was an easy decision to make because I was never that sociable to begin with, and I had moved to a new area for highschool. The community I went to was known for its secluded nature, and relatively cold to outsiders. Once upon a time, it was easy. The classes weren't killing my will to live like they do now, and I always enjoyed the productivity of the workshop more than socializing anyway. But it meant that all my memories of highschool are filled with my desire to set myself up as different, and in some ways superior to my peers. As time went on I realized the superior part died with my inability to get my grades up to stellar. In that environment, I had a 3.9 gpa graduating, but apparently that isn't saying much. When I went into college, my dad wanted it to be a transformative stage for me. It was supposed to be a place where I could grow and meet people who were just like me. 

Lo and behold, it was the same as in highschool, just everyone seemed smarter than me. I tried to meet people, but it all failed disastrously. So much in fact that I've become nearly a complete shut-in. I sometimes comment to myself that every time I leave my living space, I'm reminded of how much I hate everyone. I hate how people take my shopping cart when I try to help someone. I hate Karens that think the world is their fleshlight. I hate seeing people be happy, and most of all, I hate myself because I couldn't be one of them. 

One of the things I did in highschool was I became a staunch American. That sounds really stupid, but prior to highschool I wouldn't call myself mentally aware of my ''Americanness.'' Ironically, my desire to become more American made me less so. Because in my mind I created an idea of what American was, when Americans don't really contemplate what is and what isn't their culture. Usually members of a culture exist within it, and live in tandem with it. The borders that exist in their mind are natural, and came from them being raised and conditioned by it. But my situation is unique. I wasn't born American. I was born to 2 Communist Chinese parents. Thus, they raised me as such. But when I lived life in America I sort of became a hodgepodge of both. So in highschool, I drew artificial borders around what was and wasn't American, and lived by those standards. The reason why I decided I wanted to become ""American"" was because I wanted to permanently dispel the notion that I was Chinese. This was because I knew the hybridization of the two cultures would cause me more problems than if I was one or the other. Thus, I chose American because no one was going to be Chinese with me. As time stretched on however, I realized how poorly this mindset had served me. I had failed to become ''American'' because doing that isn't up to an individual, its up to the culture. But by drawing so many artificial boundaries, both technical and social, I fell farther out of grace with my peers. But not only had I not become American, the fake idea of what was American no longer suited me. I tried to use that American identity to form relationships in College. Now that I'm looking back on it, I realize that my false conceptions might have contributed to my inability to fit in. 

In the second semester of College, I decided I'd leave behind both cultural ideas. I was alone at the time. I had exactly one friend, and he lived 10 states away. I decided that seeking the truth is the best option. What was the truth? Well, I decided it was the fundamental rules that hid behind cultural conditioning. I decided that I would exist beyond the cultures, perhaps in a vain attempt to make myself better than them. This was a fatal mistake, because I next realized that beyond culture, there is nothing but the chaos of nature. Rape, murder, arson, thievery, infidelity, cruelty, it was all fair game in a world with no guidelines. This realization broke me in some ways. It made me realize how far I had strayed. It was a terrible mistake to think that beyond culture there lied something better. Now, I find myself in a darker place than I ever had before. I have awareness of both of my parent cultures. I can see the flaws and benefits of both, and in my mind I think I have the ability to choose between the two, but the truth is I've come too far to exist in either of them. I can't go back to being American, not with all the things I've ''learned''. The opportunity to be Chinese died after my mom left China anyway. Thus, I exist in cultural limbo. Even now, I think that going back is a choice. But its not a choice. Who would have me, this wastrel, a drifter, good for nothing but meaningless contemplation. So from this angle, I too, am completely fucked.

Now that you've heard my ramblings, you can see the state I am in. In anything that matters, to me at least, I seem to be fucked. I suppose the good news is I haven't succumbed to drugs or alcohol. I haven't started to carry a rope in my backpack, and I haven't done something socially irreversible like murder. All in all, from the outside, my problems are, like I said, mediocre. I'm not a rape victim(not that I know of at least), I'm not a war refugee, nor a starving kid working in a western scrapheap. I am however, on a bullet train to suicide if I don't get some guidance. I don't know if I can ever be happy again. I don't know if all of this suffering I feel now will be alleviated by getting a job, or starting a company, or doing something productive for once in my life. I hate my weakness. I hate how I can sleep for 12 hours a day and still be tired. I hate how I can't have a conversation with someone knowing that my ability to fit in is a façade. I hate how stupid I am, and I hate how slow I am. I hate how I somehow eat and consume so much, and waste so much of my parent's money. I hate how I can't help those I want to help because of my incompetence. In my mind and my heart, the obvious solution is to kill myself. To alleviate the world of a net-negative individual. In the coming weeks and months, if nothing changes, I know where I will go. An early grave at my own hand. I want to change that. But I don't know how. All my thoughts lead to the same pit I want to leave. Maybe, you all can help me?"

I am a current Full-Time student at a University and I am having difficulty in deciding if the navy should be a route I should consider/take.,pachi1090,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lv0hcr/major_life_decision_a_navy_recruiter_contacted_me/,"**Some quick background on my current position as a student.** At the moment, I am going for a dual degree (BS) in Mathematics and Computer Engineering. I am missing about 2 more classes to complete my mathematics bachelor's, which I may be completing this coming summer. As for the computer engineering degree, this would be my first semester working towards the degree, so I'm just starting to complete the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of my potential life goals in life before considering going through the Navy.** I was aiming in completing both degrees, and then working for a Masters's at the University of Texas in Austin. After my Master's, I don't necessarily have a plan as to where I would like to work, so I was hoping to do some internships while working for my Master's and see where I would land.

&amp;#x200B;

**What the Navy appears to be offering me.** According to the recruiter, I would have to start the program right away since they were looking for me now, they wouldn't be able to guarantee that I would be able to sign up for the program later on. I would have to start the process the moment I complete my Bachelor's in Mathematics, go to boot camp, ""A"" School, ""Power School"", etc to work up to becoming a Nuclear Engineer/Officer with the Navy. In essence, I would be getting a degree in Nuclear Engineering directly with the Navy as a result of my training. After I gain my position in the Navy, they did mention I could continue my education while working with them, so I could continue my Computer Engineering degree.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of my thoughts on all of this.** I like the idea of having everything planned out for me for the most part, at least up to the six years of contract with the Navy. That part is nice since I wouldn't be able to guarantee to land a job right after college after completing my Master's. I consider myself to be a school nerd who wants to learn as much as I can while I can, so going through the nuclear route is something I had not thought about, but generally interests me a lot. On the flip side, I already kinda have things planned out as a civilian right now before the Navy contacted me.  


**What I am looking for here.** I am hoping to hear different experiences about college, the Navy, the nuclear program, etc. Anything you have to offer will greatly be appreciated."

First off, this is a throw away account. My employer has been known to skim social media, and while I don't think they look at Reddit, and I don't intend to say anything out of line or that would get me in trouble, I would rather just not risk it.

Second off, I'd like to say up front that I feel incredibly fortunate to still have a job after everything that's happened over the last year. It is not lost on me that while I'm stressed about everything that is about to happen at my work place, there are a lot of people who aren't sure when they'll see a paycheck again, and I am grateful I am still able to make a living.

I found out today that my department will be losing a handful of people over the next month. There's a few retirements, one person who is promoting to a position at a different location upstate, and someone else who got a new job all together. While the higher-ups are going to try and fill the positions as quickly as possible, the company wide hiring process is incredibly slow, and policy is such that they can't even start the process until the people have left and their positions are officially vacant. We will likely be short staffed for the next 6 months, maybe longer. The fun part is I work in a field that is pretty heavily regulated and certain parameters have to be met every single day or we could start getting fined. This means that while we are short staffed, we still have to get the same amount of work done every day. My line of work also requires someone on-site every day of the year, including weekends and holidays. Weekends and holidays tend to be slower, shorter days, so we all work a regular Monday-Friday, and take turns covering the off days, but with several staff members leaving at the same time, the rest of us will not only be working longer days to get everything done, we will all have to cover extra weekend days that wouldn't normally be ours. We will all likely be working 10 hour days, 6 days a week for the next 6 months or so. While I've done stuff like this when I was younger (in college I worked a full time job, took a full course load, and still somehow snuck in a few unpaid intern hours. I just put my head down and kept pushing forward), I'm worried that my stamina isn't what it used to be now that I'm older.

What are your tips for managing stress and making life just all around easier? I know I can meal prep on my day off so I don't have to worry about dinners during the week, but what else can I do? Any thing I can start doing now to make things easier in the future? Any tips for maximizing my one day off so I can get the necessities done like laundry, housework, and groceries, but still find time to unwind so I don't run myself down?

Thank you in advance for any advice you may have! I really appreciate it!

TL;DR I'm about to be picking up a lot of extra work, what are your tips/advice for maintaining my responsibilities while still finding time to decompress?"

I graduated in December and as for my experience, I did an internship a few years ago doing QA and data entry. The next summer I did helpdesk at the same company. Last summer I did an IT internship at a different company working with Power BI and setting up the data to be used (QA). Right now I am working at the same company I worked at last summer doing helpdesk work and they said they would give me a business analyst project this spring but I'm not 100% sure it's going to happen.

I graduated with a bachelors in IT and a minor in business administration back in December. As for my course work I have taken multiple business classes, an accounting class, a finance class, and I've learned SQL, semi-advanced Excel, and Tableau. I also took a systems analysis class that taught me a lot about business analyst work.

I am looking to do an entry level certification. The two I am looking at right now are the IIBA Entry Certificate in Business Analysis (ECBA) and the Associate Certified Analytics Professional (ACAP).

Does anyone know which one would be better for someone who is looking to be either a business, data, or systems analyst? Also do you know if these certifications would actually help someone like me who has very little experience?

Also if you know of any other that are good please let me know.

Also with my experience and coursework. Do you think I would be qualified for an entry level position as I am right now?"

The languages I use are C++, C#, Python, and Java, but I'm only proficient at Python and Java. I'm a Senior High School student (equivalent to freshmen in college), so most of my programming was just treated as a hobby back then and thus had no real incentive to keep going nor do I know if I missed some important part.

Context aside, I've gotten used to reading and writing code, but I never made anything of practical use nor do I have the motivation to. All my programs were just run as consoles or ugly GUI in Jswing. I don't know what to do next and it's hard to find the motivation to dive into creating programs with actual practical use without also being demotivated in the process.

My high school doesn't teach anything that I don't already know so I can't rely on it until next school year or maybe even until college. I want to be a Software Engineer at some tech company someday\*(I don't care which one, even smaller ones)  so I'll have to get into some internships a year or two earlier than usual (if even possible).

\*I included this bit because I thought it would be helpful to at least provide some info as to what direction do I want to go with this.

TL;DR: I enjoy programming and want to learn more to a professional level, but the next step is unclear. What do I do next?

EDIT: Updates and grammar corrections, plus this:  
Everyone's suggestions are very helpful and I managed to get back on the road again! I have stumbled another problem but I think it's specific enough to be a post of its own. Thanks to everyone!"

I'm interested to know if anyone has taken this route. I'm currently \~6 months into my PhD and not sure if I made the right decision. A little about my background:

I feel quite computationally proficient - I have a computational biomed MSc &amp; developed an R Shiny app for my thesis. I completed a bioinformatics internship and developed a complex analysis pipeline using Python, Nextflow and AWS. I really like data visualisation and am pretty good with ggplot2. I  have one second author publication from an analysis I completed during freelance work after my internship. 

My supervisors are very kind and helpful but are from biology backgrounds and do not have strong computational skills. This makes it hard to suggest changes or get guidance sometimes. I would like to do more pipeline development and ML. My project is also really interesting but it feels like I'm taking a step back in my computational skills, when I should be improving. 

I also have no desire to work in academia and honestly I want to make decent money too. I think I enjoy working with all data types, not just genomic. I also really feel like I'm wasting my 20s by doing a PhD and staying broke. I feel uncertain about whether its worth it, especially since I would happily take a data science job, rather than bioinformatics anyway. I feel like my project direction will push me further away from being a competent and desirable data scientist when I graduate. There are lots of data science jobs in my country but unsure how likely I am to get a job given my background. Any advice please?

Thanks in advance."

Reddit won't let me submit the picture of the page, but basically navbar looks good for the most part, except for the submit button that appears under the search box instead of to the right of it (the way I think it's intended to look).  How can I fix this within Bootstrap.  I know I could set the position of the button to relative and then move it, but I feel like that's pretty hacky, and I'd like to learn how to properly format it."

I have an internship lined up for after I graduate, but I didn’t have any up until this point. Here’s been my experience:

- I came into CS as a freshman with no prior experience. Literally thought the major sounded cool.
- Had to work really hard to get to where I am now — that involved attending many office hours and connecting with professors for help. 
- One professor I connected with ended up having a research opportunity for CS undergrads. I got the fellowship because he knew me personally as a student and that I was hardworking. 
- In addition to research, I got involved in a club for CS majors or similar. I became really passionate about the club and was able to include it on my resume because it ended up providing me with a good amount of experience. 

Long story short, even though I didn’t have internships, I got involved in CS outside of classes with research and clubs. I did this by making connections with my professors and taking a chance by joining a club I knew nothing about. 

Scoring an internship offer — or even an interview — comes with a lot of luck. People can literally glance at your resume for a second and trash it if it doesn’t have the key words they’re looking for.

The most important steps for scoring an internship if you’re having trouble are getting your resume fixed up (there are usually campus resources that help with this sort of thing), getting involved in CS-related activities outside of your classes, and doing things that you’re genuinely passionate about! 

A lot of the internship process is out of your control, but a demonstration of passion for your field (which you can achieve through clubs and research etc.) is something you can control in the meantime. 

Anyway, that’s just my take on it all. Everyone has a different experience — but the takeaway here is to try not to get too down on yourself if you haven’t scored an internship yet. There’s nothing wrong with you, and you are good enough. Take care of those things you can control, and an opportunity will eventually come up."

So im currently having a mini mental crisis on what I’m gonna do with my life after ns.

So some context, currently I’m a NSF soon to ord, have a diploma in IT and is trying to get into university with a gpa of 3ish. But I’m kinda stuck on whether to continue pursing IT or not since I kinda realised in poly I’m not really suited for technical work instead I’m better at managing groups and speaking/writing factual bullshit for projects. (Basically putting lipstick on a pig and smoking my way to get grades with like a 65% effectiveness)

I would say I’m a jack of all trades master of none. Since my mindset back then was to get diverse experiences so that I can pick what’s the most suitable for me but ehhh with me writing this I guess it didn’t work out...

Welp current I guess here are the things I’m interested in:

1. UX Designer 
Currently the job that I’m most interested in pursuing in the future. But my worry is more on how to get onto the pathway to become a UX Designer. Currently I’m trying to get into SIT User Experience And Game Design as my first step but I’m not too confident in passing since I failed to make the cut last year. Additionally with it being a new-ish degree I’m not sure how useful it will be in terms of skills taught and recognised it is.

2. Information Systems/Computer Science
This is more of the well... since my diploma is in IT these courses should be the natural evolution I guess? honestly not super keen on computer science consider all the math and theory involved but well it is a super useful degree that is relevant for many jobs and pays well. And I don’t really have much enthusiasm for information system too but it’s something I don’t mind doing.

3. Business 
Did my internship doing marketing and tech but mostly on designing honestly kinda crappy marketing material but that’s was enough to spark some interest in the subject. I’m probably more interested in marketing and business than continuing with Information Systems or Computer science but I don’t really think I can stand cooperate bullshit tbh and honestly I feel like the junior employee that will just flame my boss if he requests something redundant or pointless to pander to higher ups. 

4. Social Work/ Psychology 
This is a category I’m kinda interested specially mental health in Singapore but I would say I don’t think I’m suitable for it since I’m like 80% logic and 20% emotions. Like I always try to solve problems rather than look at things based on the person POV and how their emotional state may look like. (Basically I’m not the most understanding individual)

TLDR: kinda lost and don’t know what to do for the next stage of my life and need some advice"

It is now March, and I have yet to hear anything back. When I check my application page, my status is still ""in review.""

Does it typically take this long to hear back, or should I start getting concerned? 

Thanks."

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
$2000-$3000 (willing to go up to $3500 for a ""good deal"")  in the United States
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Performance&gt;Build Quality&gt;Battery Life
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
\-Not too important.  I will be taking it to classes, club projects, internships etc. but I would much rather it be able to perform/be durable than lightweight.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
15""+
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Professional Software: Lots of CAD like Solidworks and Autocad, Matlab, C++ and python programming.  Yes as well to gaming
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Yes I will be playing games on here as well.  I would like to be able to run games like Total War Warhammer II (III when it comes out) near the best graphical settings and running at least at a solid 60FPS.  I would say this is the highest demanding game I would be playing, but would like it to hold up to future games as well.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
I would like a thunderbolt connecter, if not I'm sure there's an adapter.  I already have a thunderbolt dock is the reasoning.
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I have seen the Alienware laptops and I think the specs are great.  I understand that Alienware is usually 'overpriced' but I do think that in terms of specs they're what I'm looking for.  The most attractive thing about them is a 3070 or 3080 GPU and a very good CPU.  I need a good balance between the two for gaming, CAD, and 3-D modeling programs!  Thanks for the help!"
lvgpr5,7,2021-03-01,Juggling two summer internships at the same time?,_Skys_the_Limit,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lvgpr5/juggling_two_summer_internships_at_the_same_time/,"I've emailed a few people about having a virtual internship this summer and I've gotten two offers. Both of them are going to be programming internships although I'm not really sure what the exact projects are yet.

If the internships were physical, I would most likely choose one. But I'm having a really hard time deciding between the two, and since they're both going to be virtual this year, I think I have a good chance of managing my time and working on both of them. Then again, I'm not sure if I'm subconciously trying to appear more impressive by doing two internships for the sake of my college apps, and it might hurt me by not giving my all on just one.

Do any of you have recommendations or advice? Thank you :)"

For example, a request may be made for the coder/installer to make a change to a certain policy, however, there are risks that the coding is not completed correctly due to a lack of the coders interpretation of the required coding and they may miss a very important part of the request update. If you have a peer reviewer looking at their coding, what if their interpretation is the same and the error is missed?

What are ways that the coder ensures they fully understand what the 'ask' is for to ensure there's no misinterpretation issue? (besides countless documentation)"

I do not have any coding experience before I came to the college. So far, I really like it though.

So, here is my question. For now, I am aiming for the 2022 SWE summer internship and I heard personal project is so important for my resume. However, I do not really know how I should start off with. What could be a good personal project that I can start with? I am thinking about making an app but will it be too hard for me to try it? (the language I am learning is Java.)"
lvh6r4,4,2021-03-01,What are the practical benefits to doing a minor?,Mobambamed,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lvh6r4/what_are_the_practical_benefits_to_doing_a_minor/,"I was set on doing a data science minor along w my cs major because I was thinking about doing data science for grad school but I didn’t wanna double major in ds. However, now I’m questioning whether this is actually beneficial for post-undergrad academics or even hold any weight in recruiting. Would employers even care that I have this little bit of extra ds knowledge if I apply to SWE or DS or product management intern roles? Or is a minor really just for you to pursue your own interests outside of ur main major and holds no weight outside? If it’s the latter then I might not do ds minor and just take classes that interest me in general for the next 2 yrs + my cs major lol"

I know the logical next step would be to get a full time job in the tech field.

lvitvk,7,2021-03-01,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (3/1/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/lvitvk/weekly_job_qa_thread_312021/,"Hi all,

Here is the fifty-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

Should I pursue a second Bachelors in something more technical than comms? I'm interested in data science and software engineering and a Bachelors in either of these fields would be more marketable than my B.S. in Comms.

So I am a student that will finish my degree in December. I am also in my late 20’s, married, with kids. This means that any internship I get needs to be full time and pay around $20/hr (my current wage) for me to maintain my bills and such. I also cannot relocate at the moment, especially for an internship that may or may not turn into an actual job. I can do remote or something near me.

So here is my question: 

How likely am I to find an internship that would meet these stipulations?

If it is unlikely to find this, would it be more beneficial to keep looking anyway or spend my spare time learning new frameworks, tech, and skills that I can bring up during interviews and such post-grad?

Any insight would be great!"

I can handle school difficulty but I just want to know if I have screwed myself over by switching into the major so late since so many people are already getting internships, have projects under their belt, and just really good coders.

After my 3rd year, I started a 16-month internship as a backend software developer. Most of the languages I'm using are Java, C#, Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, Python, MongoDB, SQL, AWS, Kafka, Redis, Docker, DotNetCore, DotNetStandard, Gitlab, Jenkins, Octopus, Cucumber, Mocha Chai Testing Frameworks. I've learned tons in my internship and I have about 6 months remaining (I go back to finish my degree in September).

My manager recently had a call with me. He mentioned that since there are 6 months remaining he wanted me to come up with some goals. By the end of the internship, I should aim to achieve \_\_\_\_. I'm not sure what goals I should have. I've already learnt so much--way more than I could have imagined going into the internship. I don't mean to say that in a way to suggest I've learned enough and I'm happy; I get excited about learning more and more about programming, but I don't know what my goal should be. What would you recommend someone in my position come up with as a goal? Maybe phrased another way, at the end of an internship, what are the top skills that a student should walk away with that I can emphasize in coming up with a goal? That might be to help employment down the road or just general knowledge that all software developers ought to know.

I'm fascinated by AI and currently think that could be included in my goal. So that I come up with a way to incorporate some AI element in our pipeline. Most likely with Python but not sure what that would look like. For reference, we work in telematics. My primary role is working with several vehicle types and parsing all related telemetry data. I'm not sure exactly what an AI project would look like but maybe parsing payloads to see if they are valid or something like that."

But anyway, I got into a couple T5/T10s for CS, and as of rn, I'm prolly going to GT. And I'm wondering what I should do to prepare myself for succeeding in college or landing an internship.

So far, I've thought of a couple options. Firstly, I've already participated in a couple of internships, but I was thinking I could maybe reach out to companies and ask for an internship over the summer; however, I think this might have a low chance of success.

Another option would be kinda chilling and just start working on a personal project using some of the CS knowledge I know already. In addition, I could take some classes at GT (or another college) to get ahead.

Third, I was thinking that I could email some of the professors at GT and basically volunteer to be free labor over the summer for any research that they're doing. I don't know how well this will work out or if it's even a good idea, so please tell me if it is!

Oh yeah, and lastly, I'm applying to Google CSSI, so if I get that, then I'll most likely do that, but I don't think I can get it since it's so competitive. And also please tell me if there are other programs similar to CSSI that I should apply to.

I basically major in engineering and economics, but I wasn't interested in my courses that much, and didn't pull enough of a difference in the numerous projects I did. I never made a difference much, I skirted by doing the writeup, or checking their work, etc. 

I listed out all my experiences and classes and work and I noticed that I was going through the motions a lot. I also have big social anxiety that stopped me a lot, I have no connections, I didn't talk to people about academics, that I have a chance to work through now in therapy.

Speaking with a counselor opened up my interests more in writing/creative but it is still hard for me to find the drive to go for something in the industry that is a little related. I do want to do engineering, I think it is stable. 

What should I do? I keep buying time hoping something will land just based off my credentials. But nothing has changed the last couple months. I've been to career advisers, for me I don't know how to keep focusing on something, nothing seems to interest me. If I get through the application, and then an interview, I have to then get through the prep, and each step my heart is not in it. (Like before the interview, I find myself walking 20 min to do it at the library, but when I get there I realize I can't have my mask on, so then I walk back to my room, barely making it (in other words my mind really doesn't want to do it)).

I'm also on the edge of failing most of classes when I am close to finishing. I've been getting more support with therapy. 

As time keeps passing, I'm just wondering are my options going to be temp positions, or internships, or gap year volunteer things? I was trying to prevent this last Fall when I started early, but my efforts still let it happen."

lvz3f3,31,2021-03-02,TIFU by letting my ongoing mental health problems end my relationship,MassiveloserIhateme,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lvz3f3/tifu_by_letting_my_ongoing_mental_health_problems/,"Throwaway. I am writing this as I (M23) sit in bed crying my eyes out and unable to fall asleep. I am writing this for myself to get my thoughts out and help reflect on how TIFU. 

So back in to the start. I met the girl (F21) off of tinder when I was returning to school after dropping out due to adderall addiction along with an array of other mental health problems and identity issues after quitting the division 1 sports team I was on. I had never done this before and only messed around talking to girls on tinder and never pulled the trigger on meeting someone. Her profile was pretty simple and was just a reflection of her hobbies and interests but to me she seemed perfect from the moment I saw her profile. I loved all the same things so I asked her on a date to an upscale pizza place near campus and showed up on crutches with a full leg brace. A great first impression that we had many laughs about later on. After that date I was even more convinced I wanted to be with this person and went out of my way to show it. Fast forward about a year into our relationship I relapse. 

I had been struggling with school, work, stress and just convinced myself to take the easy route with adderall and sleepless nights. It took a toll. I was abusing it. Eventually all the sleepless nights, drugs, and lack of taking responsibility for absolutely anything, I broke. I can’t remember what triggered it but I had a 2 week long psychotic episode that looking back at it very well could have been the start of schizophrenia if it had gone on longer.

Well in the midst of all this what does this angel of a human being do? Takes me home to get help and sticks by me while pushing for me to love myself and get better. The docs said I seemed like I was on the road to recovery so no need for sedatives, just don’t smoke weed or take any stimulants. And what do I do the same fucking day when I got back to school? Took a bong rip. And another episode. This one ended in me checking into the hospital for a week willingly on a 51/50. Meanwhile my girlfriend is dealing with her own school work and heading her entire sorority’s recruitment process. I can’t believe she stuck with me STILL after the hospital. I reluctantly started antipsychotic meds which I only stuck with for a month. The drugs were terrible making me gain 20+ pounds in a month and gave me extreme vertigo. I was not fun to be around and extremely embarrassed of my episodes. But given that all this was happening at the beginning of a new school year and I had already taken 2 years off for similar stupid issues, I felt like I had no choice but to push on and finish. I wasn’t psychotic anymore but I felt like I spent the next year masking my emotions about those episodes and refused to talk about it. Yet the girl of my dreams still found ways to make me smile everyday. We spent almost all night of our time together. We loved each other dearly and talked in detail about our future life together. Got a place together during the pandemic. She got an amazing online internship for the summer. I waited till after school to even apply because of anxiety and fear of rejection. I ended up taking the first thing that paid and it ended in me being a victim of fraud and with -$5000 in the bank. Basically the person took a giant shit on my summer financial plans. I ended up getting a restaurant job as a busser to cover my share of rent and expenses, but with the pandemic the income was unstable. We got shut down for weeks at a time and eventually permanently closed in December. I wasn’t making my fair share. These past 6 months since taking on this lease together I’ve been slowly losing my self worth and coping with weed and video games while my girlfriend worked her ass off. I took care of the apartment and that made her happy. Through all this I kept deteriorating, losing any vision I had of my future and began I questioning my will to live. I drifted away in my own pain while she kept us together. 

So here a month into our last semester of college. She finally broke up with me. It wasn’t an angry or resentful break up. We both knew it was coming for weeks and I respected her decision. The most painful part of it was that she said she still loves me and wants the future we planned for ourselves and that door will always be open in the future, but first I must get better, because she deserves better. She’s fucking right. 

If any of you readers have made it this far the moral of this story is a common one. Love yourself and don’t be afraid to seek help. I started therapy last week and I have to say it’s under appreciated and I have hope for the future. Also if you’re questioning my thowaway username please keep in mind I was a hot mess when I began to make this post. 

TLDR: I spent years with a girl who put up with my addiction, 2 psychotic episodes, and the depression that followed. She’s a saint and I did not deserve her. I’m seeking treatment and learning to love myself again.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind comments and support. Time to grab life by the balls and do what must be done to get better for myself."

I had an online meeting with my supervisor and my fellow interns. We had to present our findings to show our progress, cool no problem. Come my turn, i had to share my screen, cool still no problem. Then i had to show a video relating to the topic, still cool.

Here's the fuck up, i had to find the video in my computer so i have to open the file explorer. I went and open the file explorer and Windows being the ""helpful"" os it was, displayed in the quick access tab on the left, my past files with a few of them being nsfw. Me being an idiot and realising too late that my fucking screen was shared with everyone quickly stopped sharing my screen before finding the intended video and playing it.

At that point i was speechless and hoping desperately that they didn't notice a few files with some ""inappropriate"" titles, but i can never know. My options are to just hope they didn't notice and act like everything is normal or ask them directly ""hey, did you happen to notice the porn on my computer?""
Either way, i feel like disappearing right now.

And yes, i fucking knew windows would do that and i fucking knew i should have cleared that up from the quick access but I didn't. I procrastinated and forgot, which added with my slow thinking and reaction time, got me exposed as the nasty dude at work. Plus I'm in a conservative country where porn is seriously looked down upon. So the feelings of shame makes me feel double fisted fucked. The only saving grace i have from this is that i didn't accidentally open the smut files and gave them a screen full of nude women. 

TL,DR: exposed some nsfw stuff on computer to supervisor and fellow interns but not sure if they noticed, so now i feel like imploding to oblivion."

I'm a HS student from a 3rd world country seeking to study in either the US, Canada, or EU to eventually gain citizenship and live a comfortable life. I have zero preference for the location, environment, culture, etc. I'm mostly concerned about the job prospects, especially entry-level CS positions since I'd be a fresh grad, and the risks involved in getting citizenship.

I'll study Computer Science with an aim to be a Software Engineer. But more importantly, I aim to take the best option to a. gain citizenship, b. live comfortably while also having major financial security under my belt with a job I don't hate.

Here are some options I've considered:

Plan #1: Go to a (basically) no-name uni for undergrad in a no-name province in Canada (Newfoundland). Hustle to find internships, any related experience in general to my major. Then apply to SWE jobs in the bigger cities and move there. Get my employer to sponsor a work visa for me and get PR.

* PROS; Uni is cheap. In fact, the cheapest in Canada. I won't be much of a burden to my parents. A viable gateway to Canadian citizenship which is much more direct than the lottery-based USA. Cheaper living costs.
* CONS; Big risk of not getting entry-level positions in time by the time I graduate. I fear that my location and school will greatly reduce opportunities for internships and networking. Because of this I fear I may not be able to have enough time to secure a job and be sent back to my home country, square one.

*In the scenario that Plan #1 doesn't work, I'll save up money and go for a masters in the US (aiming for UC Berkeley and its top-ranked cousins) and shoot my shot in the US.*

Plan #2: Community college in California, transfer to a more recognizable name in Cali, hustle jobs in hot tech hubs up until 90 days after graduation, get my employer to sponsor work visa, Green Card.

* PROS; Location. I'll be in an area with better salary, more jobs available, and more networking opportunities.
* CONS; I ASSUME getting an internship by the 2nd/3rd year would be much harder than those in 4-year colleges. BIG BIG risk of not being able to get a job since I've read that many employers are unwilling to issue a visa, and I'll be sent back home to square one. Plus the location's highly competitive, I doubt anyone would hire a fresh international grad. Much more expensive than the no-name in Canada. So I probably won't get a Masters without big scholarships.

Plan #3: A year in the Philippines (not my home country) then transfer to the Netherlands/Germany (Most likely NL though because they teach in English). Look for work in NL, employer sponsors work visa, PR.

* PROS; Cheaper than CC + 2 years in Cali
* CONS; Don't really know about the job prospects, I assume since NL is in EU, you can access most of Western Europe without problems and so job prospects won't be that bad. I've read about salary of SWE though, somewhere around 2000 EUR, which is underwhelming ig? And part time jobs and internships will be harder to find as everyone Dutch can speak both Dutch and English well, so why should they hire an international and go through complicated paperwork when they can just have Dutch people?

Yeah, I really don't know what to do. I'm really scared of not being able to get an employer to sponsor my visa and waste my money and time studying abroad. Any help or insight will be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask me any questions."

I'm a fresher, with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, from a mediocre college. 2 internship at couple of PSU. Built a couple of Advanced Mechanical Projects, as part of the coursework and otherwise. Completed a few Industry oriented courses. 

Nothing boastworthy: well read, informed on current affairs, tech trends &amp; pop culture, follow mechanical tech closely.  

Plusses: have a very good eye for detail &amp; design, catch on quick, always willing to learn new skills related to things I love, and things I might enjoy(Robotics), incredibly realistic pessimist (generally) 

Minuses: lack extensive hands-on experience with the industry required skills(Trade skills)

Tech stack: Auto-CAD, CAMWORKS, CNC Programmin and Machining, SOLIDWORKS, Tableau, Excel, Tally, Python, FreshDesk - moderately proficient in all 

Problem - Need advice/help in transitioning and finding a good job in Finance/Banking sector, if anyone of you could just give me a chance to prove myself I could even work for free temporarily as long it's a finance/bank. 

What I have already done - Applied to more than a few companies, but have received no response. I have uploaded my profile to various job portals like Monster, TimesJobs, Naukri, etc (I am genuinely appalled at how inefficient &amp; incompetent they are). I have also tried to speak with a few people who have contacts within a certain company, or are working there themselves, and there have been a few leads but unfortunately, nothing has come to fruition. I'm 26 btw. 

So, my question is - 

What am I doing wrong? What more do I need to do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

For any redditors that might be interested themselves, or know of any available opportunities/openings, please feel free to PM me. Regardless, any help or advice would be immensely appreciated. I will answer any (follow-up)/questions you might have.

From time to time, students ask me for advice. While responding, I always do a bit of retrospective on my career in Data Science.

What did I learn? Would I choose a different path?

This article is a write-up of lessons learned through my professional career.

# Eight years ago…

I started my professional career in 2013 when I got a Data Scientist internship in a research institute - a dream come true. I was doing research in distributed Machine Learning algorithms, which was a popular field at the time. Those were the days of Hadoop.

Things were simple back then, Big Data was the only buzz word. Then came Deep Learning and AI.

I have the best memories of that time - working with cutting edge technologies, soft deadlines, great team… I could go on and on.

There was only one problem - salary!

A year and a half into the internship I was offered to pursue a Ph.D. in Data Science focusing on Natural Language Processing. While I was honored, I declined the offer as NLP didn't interest me that much that I would focus at least 4 years of my life to it.

Other reasons were that I was broke and I wasn't getting younger either - 26 with no professional experience.

You don't need to have a Ph.D. to work in Data Science.

In retrospect, I never regretted my decision not to pursue a Ph.D. By declining the offer, I had to make a jump from academia to the industry.

# A great leap

I'll never forget that day. A CTO of a small startup invited me to a job interview. The day I got the invitation was the same day as the interview itself.

I said to myself, what do I have to lose and I went. We had a nice chat about my experience, how would I solve certain things - not too technical, more concept-wise. In the end, he asked me what I was getting paid in academia and he offered me 3x more.

What do I have to lose?

I didn't intend to accept the offer prior to going to the interview. It felt great working in academia, but then I thought about the salary and those cozy offices with new MacBooks… I accepted the offer. There was no way back.

In November, the boss offered me a contract of 3 months, starting on December I was told. $15 a week, and $120 at the end of the 3 months to make a total of $300.

I asked him the first week and 2 weeks later, and he told me that it was under revision and I'd get a copy sent later. 

From December 15th to February 20th I did almost nothing. No calls from my boss, almost no messages from my superior (which has now quit and I'm my own superior now?). I felt ghosted but I was still getting paid (sometimes). A contract is a contract, I thought.

I'm a French student in an engineering school (junior equivalent for those in the US), and our school requires at least 4 months abroad during our 3-year cursus.

For our first internship, we have total freedom, except the fact it has to be at least 6-weeks long : volunteering, research, start-up, company, it doesn't even have to match my scope of studies (electronics, automation, programming).

The thing is, I'd like to get a paid internship, in order to at least amortize costs of living abroad for 6-8 weeks, and ideally make some spending money too. In France, if you do an internship for 8 weeks minimum, you have to be paid, it's the law.
I was wondering if it's the same in other countries (especially Ireland, England, Japan, Holland, Canada and the US), or if in those countries internships are at your own loss.

Obviously, I'm mostly interested in engineering fields (especially programming as I think it's the easiest to do abroad, talking about communication skills and all), but I'm open to all of your experiences regarding finding an internship (with or without an agency ?),m and finding a place to stay (couch-surfing ? Hotels ? Included housing ?).

**Backstory:** I am currently in the IT field working for a trading firm. I'm making good money but absolutely HATE everything about my job / career path and need to get back to what I've always loved doing. I attended an A tier university and in the middle of my Sophomore year of a CS degree when I earned an internship that quickly turned into a nice paid salary position. I was going to school part time and paying my way through and decided after the full time bump it was not worth continuing my schooling.

**Current:** I am preparing to take my bonus and live off my savings for a few months to a year and grind the development path. I've been taking React / Web dev classes and have several projects on my resume. I want to spend all the 60+ hours a week I've been working and put that into learning the skills I need to get hired as a developer. I have several friends / communities where I will be working on projects further adding to my resume / portfolio.

**Plan:** My current plan is to have my life revolve around the following:

* Projects with others (learn real world experience)
* Grind leetcode / hackerrank
* Continue becoming proficient in
   * JS / CSS / HTML
   * React
   * PostgreSQL
   * GIT
   * Node.JS / Express.JS

**Conclusion:** I would love any suggestions / tips / helpful critique to aid me moving in the right direction."

I need some advice whether or not to take this summer virtual internship offer. The only catch is that I have to pay the company that is offering the internship as well as pay my university as it will count towards a course credit. Overall, it will end up costing me an average of $3000CAD. I am a second degree student in computer science, my previous degree is a BSc in Biomedical Science and I am looking for some work experience in the computer science field. Is this opportunity worth it or should I just spend my summer doing personal projects using coding?

lw9vyd,1,2021-03-02,How do I stop being envious of my brother's relationship?,Kratos_Hashtag_0373,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lw9vyd/how_do_i_stop_being_envious_of_my_brothers/,"I'll keep it simple.

My GF broke up with me last year's may and that too on my birthday and she absolutely did not give me any hints about that earlier. ( Guess, she wanted to take revenge).

I was in relationship with her for 2 years in college. I invested a lot in her emotionally and financially and she left in the moment I needed her the most. Last year's Summer break, She was back home thousands of kms away and I was stuck in my campus for an internship during coronavirus outbreak. Didn't have any friends in the campus, family was back and she was the only one with whom I felt vulnerable enough to talk about anything. She left and shattered me. It took a shit load of time for me to get back to my normal self during the quarantine. 

Summer break got over, I returned to home cause our next semester was completely online. I knew my elder brother had a relationship going on for around 4 years but I didn't know anything about it until I started settling at home. 

Ever since the relationship, my elder brother has improved a lot in terms of happiness, mental health and career. He got into a good Uni for Master's degree at the same my next semester was starting. 
His relationship is really great and it seems like he and his partner are meant for each other. They do a lot of stuff for each other show how much they mean to each other and they talk to each other at the end of the day for like 1-2 hours. I am happy for him, that he's finally found someone good for him and is progressing with his career. I know he and his partner have a great life going ahead. 

Contrast to my EX, it was my first relationship and I was only in 2nd year of my bachelors. She didn't actually knew how to express emotions and feelings via words. The relationship was kind of ok for the first year but after that it started going on toxic. I didn't see the red signs at all and only until I waa deep down in that toxic pool did I realize I am fucked. She used to play with my emotions, manipulate me into doing favors for her constantly, used to gaslight me a lot, grew so much passive aggressive and sarcastic in her conversations and behaviour. I was constantly walking on eggshells with around her. Was always anxious about saying the wrong thing around her. And when I would talk about breaking up she would become ""good"" and ""caring"". She would do this and that for me, and would tell me that she has no one except me. She didn't have good relationship with her family and lost touch with her friends. Also had some mental health issues and depression. I would instantly feel guilty and changed my mind about breaking up. This happened a couple of times. I could go on and on but it would take me hours and hours of writing to summarize those 2 years.

I feel like I have got PTSD from that relationship. It's damaged me to the point where I don't even feel comfortable sharing my emotions and being vulner5 with anyone because of the slightest possibility of getting hurt. I felt regretful of wasting those 2 yearrs. I could have used them to excel at my career, explore life, travel, learn music, start a youtube channel. All those things that I actually wanted to do but didn't do because of her.

I have kind of set my mind that I would just try to improve myself at life, find better friends, give back to the community via social service and live life to the fullest.

But still, my brother's apparently ""perfect"" relationship makes me feel bad about myself. Not because having a girlfriend is so cool and you can brag about it.

But because, I don't have anyone in my life with whom I can find the maximum warmth and comfort. I don't have anyone in my life with whom I can freely talk about anything not feel judged. I don't have anyone with whom I can share my progress and achievements. I don't have anyone with whom I can be vulnerable and emotional. I don't have anyone with whom I can share what I did at the end of the day. 

I plan to get into Academia and life is going to get tough ahead. If you have someone with you, it becomes easier to get through life. I have always kind of needed someone to pull me out of the rock bottom.

Friends, familty, relatives, etc. You can only get emotional support from them to an extent.

I have already lost a best friend of mine because at some point he got tired from my shit and he got burned out emotionally when I was going through my breakup . Our friendship has never been the same after that. I don't want to do that with my other friends. I have and still learning on how to manage my emotions on my own but sometimes it's just hard.

Any advice? Sorry for the long post."

But there was a criteria where we had to summarise wtv points there were discussed in the discussion in the given 30 mins to which no participant did( I didn’t too) . Later no one was selected from my slot. Can not talking about the summary be the reason of rejection ? 

Nonetheless, I feel pretty horrible because I really wanted to do this program but I messed up I really don’t know where. Do people score jobs , internships, mentorships etc with their first try or get rejected 1000 times before securing something? Please help me cheer up.

Just want to start out with that I’m not trying to be ignorant but just want to better understand. 

I am currently a junior at a well known, public university known for engineering. While I’m a pre-med Engineer, nearly half of my friends (as well as around 35% of undergrad student body) are majoring in Computer Science. 

Compared with my course load, it seems they have much less work to do and have more free time throughout the day. Further, in terms of jobs, 90% of my CS friends have secured multiple FAANG, Uber, Microsoft etc internship offers seemingly without much effort and will be getting paid easily $30k over the summer and I assume high $100ks post graduation. 

The amount of effort expended as well as the potential returns for CS compared to other disciplines like engineering, medicine, etc seem too good to be true. 

Assuming you go to college with the only purpose of making money (regardless of interests), CS seems like  a fairly easy way. 

What am I misunderstanding? Or is this truly how CS is? Why doesn’t everyone do CS then?"

lwcefn,3,2021-03-02,Military vet son - 25 and going nowhere (again),clancampbell67,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lwcefn/military_vet_son_25_and_going_nowhere_again/,"5+ years ago my son was living with my ex.  During a visit, I confronted him to join the military since he was living at home, not going to any sort of school, and flipping pizzas PT.  My thought was that he could see the world, learn a trade, etc... After about a year of indecisiveness, he eventually enlisted in the AF for 4 years and worked as a F-35 crew chief.  Feb 2020 he was honorably discharged and was starting to re-acclimate to being a civilian and then Covid hit.  Perhaps a excuse, but he hunkered down for 6 moths.  Fast forward to present - he has taken a couple jobs - retail merchandiser and now a warehouse worker.

During his time in the service he has issues with his peers, at which time, I suggested he try and change jobs - this fell on deaf ears, as he just wanted to get the 4 years in and get out.   Like prior to going into the AF, he's in a state now where he doesn't know what he wants to do.  His interest is video games, but unless you have the skills required, it's a tough profession to get into.  To appease me, or so I think, he says he wants to get into computers.  Playing PC games and ""getting into computers"" is not the same.  His has GI bill benefits, but in my opinion,  he is not pulling the trigger because he honestly doesn't know what he wants.

I think he lacks the motivation required to pursue a degree at this point - I feel it might be a waste of his benefits.  I have suggested trade school, internships, etc...to no avail.  Talking with his mom, she thinks ""he'll be fine!"". I disagree, but I don't see him often and I feel like I am walking on eggshells every time we discuss school/career/goals.  I don't want to push him away, as my ex and I live in different states and we divorced while he was still in HS.  I feel guilt for not being there during his late teens.

I have had him take a couple ""what color is my parachute?"" tests to hopefully pique some interest.   I have sent multiple websites that have a 10000' view of the same.  It seems the further I push the more he shuts down.

I guess I am looking for some sort of advice and how to deal with this and I assume I am not alone.  Ultimately, it's his decision what he wants to do.  I guess this is more a psychological thing for me on how to treat this situation.  I appreciate any response."

lwdqfj,2,2021-03-02,Should I quit?,JebJames,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/lwdqfj/should_i_quit/,"I am sorta at a crossroads in my career and I was hoping to get some feedback, opinions, advice, and maybe some humor :). 

So some background is usually necessary, I am in the 2nd year of my experimental psychology Ph.D. program. I came into the program with a terminal master's degree in experimental psychology and in all honesty, I had to get the master's because I partied and had a good time in undergrad thus lacked the credentials to get into a doctoral program. Regardless I am in one now and I find myself pretty much every day saying out loud, WHY AM I HERE? 

Let me start with the things I enjoy because like most problems there are good sides. I LOVE teaching and mentoring. I'll spend hours trying to memorize lectures in order to convey the most important things to the students while keeping information interesting. I get to be informal and actually feel like most of my students like me as an instructor. I also really enjoy mentoring, I take every opportunity to be one in my department and find a ton of fulfillment and enjoyment from doing helping people who are smarter than me along in their careers. I also think I am fairly decent at mentoring, I have had the privilege to help several students get internships, acquire coding skills, and write letters of recommendation which again I actually enjoy doing. I also am a total weirdo and like to grade. I like the monotony of it, but also take pride in the detailed feedback I give.

However, all good things come to an end and the negatives come flowing. I guess my biggest issue I am having is that I still like the overall research question and topic of exploration but the day-to-day is a nightmare. All I do is sit and code, or test sound latencies on the presentation computer, try to communicate between parallel ports and TTL pulses. Basically, I feel like my day-to-day is doing computer science with little to no help (my PI doesn't even know how to code). I just feel so stagnant and now almost 3.5 years into graduate school I have 0, that is right 0 publications. I purposefully took only one class this semester and went back down to a teaching assistant so I could try and get more publications and today marks the 3rd time I have asked my MP to either help me use a dataset I collected to publish or use a data set that lab has that could use additional analysis and try to publish that. My emails have been ignored or I have been told by my PI ""I have to think about which data set to use"". So in my eyes, I can't publish, my daily routine involves a heavy amount of computer science, so again am faced with the daily WHY AM I HERE? 

Well, as soon as those words escape my lips I remind myself of what else can I do? Let's be honest a psychology degree even at a master's level is not an extremely employable degree so what other options are there?  It leads me down a dark spiral of feeling trapped and since depression runs in my family I'm concerned that the spiral will just get more and more extreme. 

I suppose in short if I had a prospect for a reasonably paying job I would drop this program in a heartbeat but who is gonna hire a failed Ph.D. student with a master's in experimental psychology?"

Since then I've got one **automated** email from Intuit saying we look forward to meeting you in the interview but first please fill these forms. I filled them. I haven't heard back anything after that (the forms were basic consent stuff).

Throughout the whole process my recruiter didn't contact me directly so I don't have their email. I emailed Karat Support to ask about my interview feedback yesterday but I'm still waiting for them to get back to me. 

I am going out of my mind waiting mainly because I thought the interview went well-ish? And then I got that automated email so I feel like I'm just hanging in the middle.

Should I contact the recruiter on LinkedIn? If not, any suggestions?

Also, for the people who got the internship did you get that automated email too?"

As I was going through the solution with the interviewer, our ideas seemed to align up and our solution should have worked, but as we were debugging it, we couldn't figure out why our output was returning the wrong thing. So, we spent the entire final 30 minutes, trying to debug it and try many different possibilities. Then when the interview ended, I went to check it one last time and saw that I had missed a parentheses and the compiler should have spitted out an error like invalid argument, but just gave me the wrong result instead. If it spitted our an error message, I would have for sure gotten that problem.

But man, this kinda sucks cuz this could have been my last chance at an internship this summer. :(

PS: does anyone know if its possible to request a redo of an interview on for intuit?

In January, I reached out to the hiring manager to ask if they were going to have the internship this year, to which he replied that he was unsure. 

Last week, he emailed me that his boss agreed to move forward with a remote internship this year and asked if I was still interested. After catching up via Zoom, he told me that I would have an internship position to honor last year's offer. He told me that he didn't know when an official offer would come my way, since he still has to notify HR of all the nitty gritty details. 

Everything was fine until my family friend, who also worked at that company, told me that some of the managers there did not like the idea of having a remote internship this year. Also, she told me that the hiring manager is going to be relocated to a different location soon. This information worries me a lot, since a company could very well cancel their internship with no impact to their operations. However, if I don't find an internship this year, I may very well be screwed since I'm a junior. 

What are the chances that my internship will be cancelled again?"

Me: 
- Masters in CS
- Looking to do MBA and push towards project management track rather than engineering track

My current role: Intel Cloud Solutions Engineer
- 102k base + 10k bonus + 15k stock annually
- 5 YOE (4 as intern + 1 full time) on this team
- No costs, I live with parents
- Basically 0 programming, all customer work and some project management

Goldman Sachs offer: Software Engineer 
- 100k base + ? bonus (I hear bonus is good) + relocation
- Associate level programmer with Global Investment Research team
- No stock but will ‘buy out’ the rest of my Intel stock and match vesting schedule (~30k value)
- Dallas, Texas. Would have preferred NY, will have to rent or buy

I guess GS has fancy prestige and I probably should be looking to jump jobs sooner rather than later unless I want to become a lifer at Intel and sleep in my childhood bedroom until I’m middle aged. But I could just jump to an Intel Bay Area programming role for more money anytime I want. In terms of financials and job position, GS seems somewhat horizontal, but I think I need some 3rd party perspective. For me getting an MBA and doing tech program management is the goal. 

I appreciate any advice."
lwhziy,1,2021-03-02,Chemistry Teacher or Chemist?,Fluffy-Tone2078,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lwhziy/chemistry_teacher_or_chemist/,"I am basically looking for some advice or insight to help me decide whether I should go into a career as a chemist or a chemistry teacher.

I am a chem major with a secondary ed minor and I am finishing up student teaching this semester. In high school I kind of planned on becoming a chemist or doing chemical engineering, but then I started becoming interested in teaching, so I decided to go for a chemistry major and secondary ed minor so I would have the option to do both. At college I gradually started to lean towards going into the industry with chemistry because I hated my education classes and started developing a deeper passion for chemistry. However, now that I’m student teaching, I’m reminded of why I wanted to go into teaching in the first place. I’m having fun and I’m enjoying what I’m doing, so now I’ve become torn between the two. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to do the internship I had lined up last summer because the program was canceled due to COVID, but I’d still like to do some shadowing this summer just to see more of the field.

I see pros and cons of both. Working as a chemist would pay more and probably have less stress, but I would be working longer hours and have less time off. Working as a chemistry teacher would be more social, has good hours, and good time off, but would probably have more stress and a lower pay. 

I would say I’m good at both as I have had professors push me to go to grad school to get a PhD in chemistry, and I have had teachers at my school tell me to apply to the open positions they have because they want me there. Part of me feels like I could come back to teaching after I get a chance to explore the field of chemistry more, but it would be harder to go from teaching to the chemistry field.

One thing a neighbor told me that has stuck with me is that he said he’s never seen a chemist that wasn’t happy. I believe I’d be happy in either job. I really value a work-life balance, where I’m not drained coming home from work or coming home late at night every night, so any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm guessing you guys will be a bit biased towards UIUC, so please try to be objective. To get the basics out of the way, we are OOS so no in-state tuition advantages on either side. We visited both schools last Feb, right before covid hit, and she liked both, maybe leaning towards Purdue a bit, but I'm not sure why, probably just an overall feeling. She goes to a STEM school now, so has taken several classes related to engineering and is on the robotics team. From those experiences, she seems to think she will like mechanical engineering the most. She doesn't want to do a lot of programming, likes physics more than biology or chemistry, and doesn't seem to want to do EE. 

With this in mind, it seems that being admitted to ME at UIUC is an advantage bc she won't have to go through all that competitive stress the first year. But...has anyone started at UIUC thinking they were going to do one major and ended up doing another? If so, how hard was it to change? I do think that going through all the engineering options will cement her choice better than guessing as a high schooler, but maybe it will work out in the end.

Secondly, how much of a balanced life do the engineer majors have? From what I gather, it is tough at both schools for eng, but I'm hoping she will be able to have time to also join clubs and go out with friends and relax. 

I think both schools have very close rankings, so how would you rate the ability to get internships, co-ops, and jobs after graduation? Do a lot of companies come to job fairs or do students have to go find their own opportunities? 

If she chooses UIUC, any recommendations on how to succeed? Are there learning communities? Are there many female engineering students, and if there are any on reddit, we'd love to hear from them about their experience.

I think these are most of our concerns that will help us make a decision, but if you think of anything else, please add it. I just want her to have a good college experience. She is a well-rounded person, who is good (but not great) at math and science, but also has a creative side (art and music), so I want her to be happy with what she does in college. Thank you for your time!

Edit to add: do engineering students typically do any study abroad programs or is there no time for that? If so, any feedback from anyone who has done that?"
lwlg7g,4,2021-03-02,How is my career outlook?,JonF1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/lwlg7g/how_is_my_career_outlook/,"So, hello /r/EngineeringStudents. Also, I am sorry if I am making spelling mistakes.  Last December, I suffered a severe brain injury that I am still trying tor recover from. My low GPA is related to that, I will go into more detail later.

**Here's a breath rundown of my profile:**

* Mechanical Engineering with with a Minor in German Studies.
* Current GPA of 2.88
* 3 years of good experience in a FSAE club
* As of writing, no internship/Co-Op experience but lots of general experience
*Looking to graduate on May 2022


It wasn't my intention to wait this long to start searching for jobs. If everything went as planed with my education experience that is to say, no COVID19, i would have been in Germany right now working a virtually guaranteed internship for a German Company as part of my study program Engineering &amp; German. The program was set up in a way that i would spend one year studying abroad at a German uni then for the next spring/summer, i would complete an internship with a German company such as Siemens or Porsche. The COVID19 fired made it so that I couldn't study abroad and intern as planed for years (2020-2021), I was planning to do the experience for (2021-2022) but with me suffering a brain aneurysm in December and with COVID19 still running rampant around the world, It doesn't seem like (2021-2022) will be possible either. I guess that's enough about my sob story.


**The interneship search is pretty rough so far**

It seems like internships are very competitive and sparse, so I think I need to really start planning for the reality that I may just have to graduate without an internship.It's been about three works or so since i applied to some and there hasn't been a call back. :/. I plan on keeping on with FSAE for another year so that I graduate with four years of FSAE experience underneath my belt, but that's still not really an internship. How bad would it be for me if I graduate without an internship? Could I just apply for some post graduation and get my foot in the door that way?

**Should I disclose my ""disability"" on apps or is it better to keep it hidden?**

A lot of company state that they are ""equal opportunity employers"" and have their applications so that they are asking me if I have previous history of disability. So far I have just been saying no because I feel uncountable about answering this question honestly because I feel that It would be used against me. 

I have never been officially disabled by a doctor but up until very recently, i did have something on my brain called a **(Warning, the link contains a somewhat realistic depiction of brain anatomy).** [AVM](https://www.sagarhospitals.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2_tn-28.jpg)   This AVM was actually  where my aneurysm was located, thus when I had my brain bled, it was completely removed.

AVMs are known to cause severe, migraine like headaches for me during stressful events such as exams, learn about it more [here](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/arteriovenous-malformations). 

SO having that AVM on my brain since brain and it causing a bad brain and edema recently, it has been having an effect on my academic performance. One of the reasons why my GPA is so low is that my brain stated to bled during finals without me realizing  (as the systems of the bead were very similarly to normal AVM symptoms) and eventually before my last final i was sent to the ER for emergency brain surgery, so  right now it's a 0 give me a C- in that class until I can take the final later.



I know that was a probably a long read, but I just really kind of want to know  where I am at right now. Am I up shit creek without a paddle due to me probably being unable to get an internship before I graduate? Do you guys have any advice for me?

Thanks"
lwlwvn,3,2021-03-03,"Given a promotion, told a raise would come with it, it’s now 3-4 months later and I got the promotion but not the raise. Advice wanted.",elegantpudding2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lwlwvn/given_a_promotion_told_a_raise_would_come_with_it/,"Hello all, thank you for taking the time to read this post.
Last year around September to October, it was suggested I become a supervisor at my job because management thought I had potential. I approached them and formally asked all the questions pertaining to an undisclosed amount for a raise (I was understanding that COVID was making things tight and I particularly wanted the position more than a huge raise). They agreed and said I would be a supervisor and that they could work with my school schedule ( I’m in my senior year of college and starting an internship during the summer). 

Last year, they started “training” me before I was officially a supervisor by showing me how to do things like counting registers (I already have experience in this from a previous job). It was a lot to adjust to as it is a lot more stress that comes with many additional duties but I was interested in growing in my new role. 

This year started and they told me I would be acting as a supervisor so I assumed I would get the raise since I was doing the job. I was given keys, a safe combination, special permissions, etc. I’ve also taken on more responsibility than I intended as I am expected to pick up any slack when I do not have a worker, which is fine and I am prepared to do. I always work whatever shifts they need and volunteer for weekends and the “unwanted” shifts. I do not mind, whatsoever, but I assumed I would be compensated. 

I have been officially on this roll for almost 2 months and I do not have a raise. I have gone to my boss in charge of the raises several times, all of which I felt as if I was bothering her and she would be doing other things at the same time so it was hard to feel like I was being taken seriously. There is pressure from management above her to not give raises at this time despite it being time to give annual cost of living wages to every employee as well. 

I was first told that the beginning of February would be when I would get the raise. Then mid February. Then late February. Finally the current paycheck I am receiving this week, yet when I checked my paystub this morning; no raise. I got very upset and asked if others received their raises we were told we would get snd the answer was no. 

I texted my boss, mind you it was early in the morning but she is usually up, and asked if the raises were supposed to be on this paycheck. She said yes, to her knowledge they would be. I then told her, “I feel frustrated because it keeps getting pushed back and if I’m working in a supervisor capacity, I’d like to be compensated for the position. I understand that there is push from upper management, but if I am unable to get the raise I will have to step away.” I considered this reasonable. 

She responded with, “I understand that and know that I’m working on it, but keep in mind you make more than several supervisors already there. I make more inline with someone a position above a supervisor would make. That being said, I said I would get you the dollar and I will follow through with that.”

So not only have I been being used for almost two months to fill a position they desperately needed, I’ve been told several times I’d get a raise and there was no communication from her it wasn’t happening until I would begrudgingly find her and ask her while she was busy with multiple things and unable to pay attention to me or sit me down and explain that. 

Had I been told of a cap in pay and what I was making before, I probably would have still taken the position for less just to get experience. Being strung along then told essentially I should be lucky to receive what I am getting makes me feel like it’s a hassle to have to pay me what was promised for doing much more work than I was doing before. Something about the way she threw that in my face does not sit well with me.

I’m curious as to how others have handled situations like this. Please share any stories or advice because at this point, I’m fine with finding a job that offers less but also has a more firm set of promises that will be met for a better work life balance."

This training included an 8-hour red/blue team competition in the lab's multi-million dollar mock chemical plant, where the read team tries to hack into a network while the blue team tries to defend it. I was put onto the red team. For god-knows what reason, my 12 red-team teammates - professionals with decades of experience, many of whom worked incredibly important national security positions - unanimously elected me as their captain. It went really well!! Just as a side note, I took a risk and described this activity in its fullest in the additional information section rather than in the small description MIT gives you in their application.

I'm working as an Applications Engineering Intern currently at a medium-large-but-unknown company that builds custom vehicles.

I was ecstatic when I got this opportunity, I still can't believe how cool it is some days, but it has soured. It's amazing that I'm in my early 20's, without a degree, and I am able to go to work everyday and literally engineer these vehicles for customers. But man, they don't pay me for it.

I get paid $13/hr.

The scope of my job has changed drastically since I've started. Honestly, $13/hr was probably perfectly justified when I started. All I was doing was learning solidworks and shadowing/doing small tasks for coworkers.

But It's gotten to the point where I literally do the whole job. I am sent a quote by my boss. I do the preliminary structural engineering, I reach out to the Tech sales rep with any major issues. I am sent the work order. I order the vehicle's body manually and communicate with the body engineer. I engineer the vehicle entirely. Identify issues, conduct a stability assessment, all of it. I am the sole designer on calls when we present the model to the customer with the account manager for approval. I make the changes. I have parts made. I follow up on the bom. And I support production. 

Today I was able to go up on the production floor and see my vehicle being built. It's amazing to me. I'm really doing it. I could have never imagined this. 

But they refuse to give me a raise.
Last friday I had a heated talk with my Boss's supervisor. They just wont do it. I could go into details, but please just trust me, after numerous attempts they will not budge. 

This week is terrible. I normally take pride in my work. This week I am so unmotivated. I feel so unappreciated here. I don't know what the point is anymore. It's making me feel depressed, honestly. I just feel so unappreciated and taken advantage of. I can't keep doing this.

I'm planning on moving to the production floor soon, the starting pay is $17.30. It's what I'm going to have to do until I start at a new university in the fall.

Edit: [https://evildrcoconut.github.io/index.html](https://evildrcoconut.github.io/index.html)

Here is my website! Please mind the spelling and grammar errors, they will be fixed. I mostly am looking for criticism on color schemes, layout, etc

I decided to take a break from another personal project to create my own website to help ""market"" myself. Unfortunately, due to covid, internships are not easy to come by. So to help market myself further, I decided to further my html, learn css and js, and create a website to insert into those pesky application sections where they ask for ""website"".

However, I would love to learn where I can find some criticism on how to further improve my website and where I could look to find such improvements. I would also love any information on getting this project onto the web for others to see, so any information on good, affordable web hosting services would be appreciated!

Thank you!"
lwn9xd,5,2021-03-03,Should I lie to my recruiter to pressure them to respond sooner?,lookingforhelp007,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/lwn9xd/should_i_lie_to_my_recruiter_to_pressure_them_to/,"So I had an SWE Intern interview with a F500 company on Monday last week. I contacted my recruiter today to check if there has been any update, and she said they usually respond in about 2 weeks. She asked if I have any pending offers, and she can update the hiring manager. I haven't responded back to her email yet. My main concern is that by the time they get to my profile, there won't be any open position left to fill. Several people on this subreddit have had their interviews a couple of weeks before mine and they have already received their Intern offers.

Here the 3 options that I am considering:
1. Not reply back and wait for them to reach out. 
2. Tell the recruiter that I have no pending offers. 
3. Lie to the recruiter about a pending offer, so that they can speed up application. 

I really need this offer because I don't have anything else lined up for summer. 
Any suggestions on what I should do?"
lwnj87,4,2021-03-03,Please help! CPP vs UCD Dilemma (Animal Science student),Damn-Deedly-Da,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lwnj87/please_help_cpp_vs_ucd_dilemma_animal_science/,"Hey y’all. I am currently a Senior in high school who is in the midst of deciding between Cal Poly Pomona and UC Davis for their pre-vet Animal Science programs. So far I am leaning towards Pomona, who accepted me for their school’s program back in February. To make things easier (or at least I hope it is) I’ll put my pros and cons list for both schools so far.

Pomona Pros:
I really like the fact that Pomona has a heavy hands on approach. I am a kinesthetic learner and would benefit greatly from this type of program. Pomona’s program is also smaller which is better for me both in terms of getting letters of recommendations for Vet School later on and because I am Hard of Hearing. It is also diverse (most people in the Animal Science program are Latinx) which is nice to me because I’m Latino myself. It’s also only about an hour or so away from my house without traffic. It (now) runs on a Semester system, which is something I am used to at my community college, but I am willing to be on a Quarter system as well. Housing is also cheaper compared to the UC’s so that’s a plus too. I’m not sure how the program is holding up during COVID though.

Pomona Cons:
But it is also not in the safest area, even if it does have a lot of things within its vicinity to look forward to (LA, Anaheim, Santa Monica, etc). Though I can’t drive as of right now because I wouldn’t have my own car. CPP is also a commuter school so there’s typically less people on campus on weekends. Thankfully, money is not as big of a concern because the Department of Rehabilitation is willing to pay for my tuition fee, which means I only really have to worry about affording the housing fee. I’m also starting college with all my GEs completed thanks to community college, which means that technically I would have a junior standing from the get go. I want to have the best college experience that I can even if it is short.

Davis Pros:
Here’s where the issue lies. I’m not really one for going based on branding, but if you are the top Veterinary school in the country then your undergraduate program is bound to be pretty great just by default. Davis has also been said to be safe and have a “college town” vibe to it. It is also about eight or so hours away from where I currently live so it would feel less like I was commuting and more like the genuine college experience that I’m looking for. Especially because the campus is so big and freshmen can’t have cars! It’s also stated by GLAAD to have the best LGBT clinic, which is important to me because I’m transgender and in the process of beginning my medical transition very soon. 

Davis Cons:
 The only issue is that I’ve heard students don’t really find it as much hands on. I’ve heard that going here would be more research based due to being a UC rather than career based like CSUs are. But there’s always summer internships to make up for that right? I’m also planning on attending Davis for their Veterinary Program but I have heard that it is harder to get into it if you have been in their undergraduate program. And even so, I am planning on working more with endangered/conservation/wildlife work so I might not end up aiming at Davis for graduate school after all since it focuses on small vet.


Now we’re finished, sorry that this was so long! I wanted to address as much as I could because most of the posts I have seen asking this question online either mentioned SLO or were in pre-COVID times. I have yet to hear back from Davis so if I am denied I guess that answers this question haha. I just want to know that I made the most informed decision I possibly could’ve and have no regrets in my college experience. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this! Any information or advice that you guys can give me is very much appreciated. Stay safe guys!

TLDR: I like Cal Poly Pomona’s Animal Science program better but I would want to go to UC Davis for the college experience (assuming campuses are open in fall 2021)

UPDATE: Accepted into UC Davis’ Animal Science program!"
lwnni5,0,2021-03-03,University does matter,templecancelclass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lwnni5/university_does_matter/,"I asked myself this question before going to college: does college matter in getting a CS job?

The answer is: yes it does. A high tier college increases chances of landing a job in companies significantly. By high tier I mean less than 20% acceptance rate. A low tier college decreases your chances. Even if your GPA is high and you put a lot of effort in projects, it's hard to land a good internship.

High tier colleges have good networking with major tech companies. Lower tier companies have networking with banks and etc, and minor tech companies.

And yes, a good college increases your chances for an interview when you apply online to other companies. The only way to beat the odds with a lower tier college is to stand out among the many other students. And I don't mean just GPA, but stand out in learning, projects, work, and academics.

As an example, we have student A in an elite university, and student B at an average below 40% acceptance rate university. Student A just needs to focus on academics and his or her side projects to land the first internship because student A knows that 50% of his class will get into Amazon, Google, etc. But student B needs to stand out among all the students in his class. And not only academically he or she needs to stand out, but in course load, job, projects, and online presence. Because student B knows that only 10% in his or her class can get into Amazon, Google, Facebook, and etc.

Now I am not suggesting you to go to an elite university, but consider this aspect as well. If you have other networks then don't worry. But if you think you will stand out, make sure to reevaluate.

I believe this is a major reason I am still unemployed. My internship got cancelled from a company which hired a lot of people from my college. Yes, Covid was unlucky, but if we were an elite college, they would not just cancel the internship, or I would have many other options that could replace it. 

Welcome to my ted talk,

Thanks for listening to my rants."
lwny5e,3,2021-03-03,Do I quit a job after 2 days when I already know it's not right for me?,nikkilu21,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lwny5e/do_i_quit_a_job_after_2_days_when_i_already_know/,"Let me just start by saying I've never done anything like this before. When I start a job, I usually stick it out for a long time (at least a year) so I know I made the right decision. But this time, my gut is screaming at me to run. The issue is I have a lot of anxiety over quitting jobs in general, so I need some advice.

So, a couple of years ago I got my master's degree in clinical psychology. I completed my clinical internship but then covid hit. The company I used to work for asked me to come back and work remotely as a project manager. I accepted because the pay was good and my s.o. just lost their job.

Recently, someone I went to school with asked me if I was interested in a job with her non-profit. It all looked great on paper. Good pay, full benefits, work/life balance, etc. I went through three rounds of interviews and was offered the position. Well, today was day 2 and I already know I want to quit this job.

Everything has been very chaotic since the minute I showed up, and I'm usually pretty flexible when it comes to chaos. I'm upset for a number of reasons:

* I was told that I would be working with a higher functioning population base, and today I was informed that I'll be assigned almost exclusively those diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar, heavy substance abuse, etc. I believe those living with these disorders arguably need mental health assistance the absolute most, however, I did my internship with this population and my own mental and physical health suffered as a result. These people need so much help, I just can't be the one to help them.
* After speaking with another clinician at the company, she said, ""ah, so they hooked you too, huh?"" and when I asked her what she meant, she said that the pay, benefits, and work/life balance is what drew her in too, and now she feels stuck. She said, ""I hope it's different for you"". Major red flag.
* I was not told that I would be conducting therapy in the field, and that is exclusively where I would be conducting *all* therapy sessions (ie. shelters, board &amp; care facilities, government housing, etc.). It seems extremely irresponsible that this wasn't told to me during the interview process. I will be traveling anywhere between 20-100 miles per day depending on session scheduling, sometimes transporting clients to psychiatry appointments in my own car.
* There was a company-wide email sent out at the end of today that said something along the lines of, *this pandemic has made us lose too much money so telehealth is no longer permitted, as of today you must perform all therapy in-person so we get properly reimbursed by the Department of Mental Health.* I think this was the nail in the coffin for me honestly. This speaks volumes about their priorities.

I have been in so many toxic work environments and have done enough personal therapeutic work to know one when I see it. I absolutely don't want to get myself into yet another toxic work situation.

*Pros of quitting*: I already know in my gut it's what I will eventually do, HR hasn't processed paperwork yet (see below), I can get my old job back easily (they've said I can come back whenever), and I'd finally be learning from my past mistakes

*Cons of quitting*: upsetting my friend who put me up for the job, pissing off new supervisors, confrontation of quitting (very anxiety-provoking for me), and I'm not sure how easy it would be to get another job in the field after not working in it for over a year.

**Here's why I feel like I need to make a decision tonight:**

I haven't yet turned in any of my HR paperwork. Tomorrow morning, I have a meeting at HR headquarters at 9am to turn it all in and make everything official. I don't want to waste their time inputting *literally* an inch-thick pile of paperwork when I already know that I want to quit this job.

**So here's my question:**

Is it worse to quit after two days before HR paperwork has been processed? Or stick it out a week or two so they know that my decision wasn't hasty?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I don't get assigned a caseload/clients until the end of next week, so I do feel like I need to at least make a decision before then."

I am a 3rd year student, currently looking for internships. I was lucky enough to get offers from 2 companies in IT. Let's call them company A and B.

Company A is very big, but i wouldn't do something i am completely passionate about. The internship is easy and i quite like it, but i don't see myself doing that in the future. However, the salary is very, very good and i might have the opportunity to convert to a full-time job at the end of the university.

At company B i would do something i like very much. However, the company is not quite as big and the salary is not as good. Moreover, the process of converting does not really work the same, i think i could get a job here later, opposed to the first company.

I would also want to mention that i support myself financially and if i accept company B, paying rent would be difficult. However, it's what i want. What would you do?"

Now, I know there will still be fees or things I have to pay for if and when I decide to study there, but I'm not sure which ones since Google results have somewhat conflicting between articles. To be honest, I'm still not 100% sure about it but I do want to move out for personal reasons.

Is the housing typically included in the program or is that on me? Learning materials? I'm trying to figure out if the cost of living there (even with the free education) is greater than if I continued to study in a well-known university in my country. (Assume $2000 is the tuition here.)

However, my mental health has been seriously suffering these past few months and so I dropped the class a while ago. My mental health also started to affect me in end of last semester in EECS 280, to the point where on the first exam I scored in the 90s and on the final exam I was in the 70s. This made 281 immediately overwhelming because a lot of the topics at the end of 280 are used in 281. I’ve been struggling with imposter syndrome and questioning whether or not I am actually smart enough to be a cs major because in 281 I felt like I just had no idea what I was going and it made me seriously doubt myself. I dropped the class to help my mental health but instead I’m finding myself dreading the class and also beating myself up for dropping it in the first place and failing to learn the content well enough in 280. 

So now I’m trying to decide if I should take 281 in the spring semester or just wait to take it next fall. If I take it in the spring then I would be ready for fall internships, but I am also very intimidated by the shortened semester and heavier workload and I don’t know if I can do it. I have actually been having nightmares about the class it’s been stressing me out so much. 

So, does anyone have any experiences or advice about EECS 281 in the spring? Ways to prepare for 281? How to combat imposter syndrome and self doubt? Also, if I do end up taking 281 in the fall, do I still have a chance at getting an internship?"

My entire academic career I've started out passionate about the thing I'm studying (I do engineering). I started out so excited but as my degree progressed I have harboured so much resentment for this industry. To me it is so adhd unfriendly (as are a lot of jobs). So much of engineering is about gaining experience through internships which you need to get on with extracurriculars or very above average grades.

 I have tried and failed so many times to take up extracurriculars. Joining projects and then leaving them halfway through because I simply don't have the focus or energy to see them though. This means my only concrete achievements are my grades. And even they're only slightly above average, because again I find it so difficult to focus. I'm looking for grad jobs now and I feel like I'm so far behind everyone else. Every job listing asks for experience and I have none. I list on my CV academic experience I have gained through projects, but even then I know its not enough. 

I just feel like no matter how hard I try, there is no place in the engineering world for me. Everything requires so much multitasking to prove you are worthy of a job and I just can't do that. It makes me so sad because people have always remarked at how 'smart' I am, and I feel like I am letting them down. My family is full of successful people who have managed to get where they have through hard work, and I'll just be the disappointment.

It's for a basic PC Technician position, featuring basic help desk duties. I did a phone interview with several individuals. It could end up being a temporary position so nothing is guaranteed long term, but I don't have any experience so I think this could be a good opportunity. Starting pay is $18.

I am doing my best to pass everything to finish and I should be able to manage.

However, I've asked my career adviser, about how my interests may not lie exactly with my studies, about how I bullshitted a lot of my work without developing more of an interest in undergrad. I told her the troubles I had with answering basic interview questions since I couldn't see what I wanted to do. She suggested things like looking into internships that more relate, or other positions. 

I'm looking, but I'm really lacking that urge to go through and apply again, I keep holding back and letting time pass. I know all the times I apply for jobs and I get an interview and I need to do the interview better, but to do that I need to process my undergrad experience but every time I try it just feels so fishy. (I know I can spend time to make answers but even questions like why this major/what was your favorite project are hard to answer) Like I did things just to do them, without any meaning behind. 

Does anyone have suggestions or can relate? I know I can't just blindly apply, I need to feel more of an empowerment to get something and actually want it. I've had a rough time with social life in college so what I would like is to make friends, get a girlfriend, be better with people haha, to 'catch up'. But I know that's not related but still. I am starting therapy again too."

Please read, I really don't know what to do",PopCandy420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lx1i4p/scared_for_the_future_and_experiencing_unwanted/,"So essentially due to online college, my (20F) competitive gpa tanked down to an okay gpa.

I'm in the middle of transferring to a uni with a 2 year research program. Its one of the main reasons why I want to transfer because rn all the good internship opportunities out there are 1) cancelled, 2) not sure if it will even happen or if itll be virtually, and 3) are out of state and me being in california( a.k.a the hotspot for 2020) is essentially a big nope.

I feel like dropping out or at least not transfering because I don't have any sense of direction and no matter what I try, I just struggle learning online while professors decide they wana be cocky and take pride in giving you the worst grade possible.

My major is in Bio and even though I understand that right now I can graduate to get an AA in bio at my cc, I really need a few research internships going so I can use that to combat my meh gpa. This is critical for grad schools and post bacc's I want to attend.

I know I have this semesters classes to improve my gpa as well as 2 more years approx of classes for a bachelors so its not the end of the world.

I just don't know if its best for me to hold off transferng to uni this fall until its at least hybrid learning.

On top of this all, I ended up having to submit my fafsa without my parents tax info since I am a dependant and they don't want to give it away since its ""private information"".

I been stressing and crying over this ever other day, and these bad unwanted thought of suicide have been making me feel worse.

I have been trying to get help, but im broke rn and therapy is expensive. Free help is kinda good, but its not helping me remove these thoughts from my brain.

We depend on my grandfather to live, we can't afford even to rent a place just for us. My dad's business (a restaurant) never returns any profit, he works only to pay the people from whom gets his commodities. He a is hard working person, but has no ability to invest. He drove my mother into this business after she was fired from her well paid job but she hates doing calculus. Now with the pandemic I have never seen her so depressive. My father goes out to work everday, he isn't a quitter, but blames her for her disease (depression). Im a law student and just got out of a paid internship - few firms are hiring clerks w/ pandemic and shortage of resources - and can't financially help and find myself also depending on them. And I myself got depression too, specially cause I can't stand seeing my mother like that. It will take years for me to just have a good salary and be able to help them. I don't have any hopes of improving anytime soon. And for our situation I got a repressed anger towards my father that I can't control sometimes. I love him but I believe he's the cause my mother is that way. She is drinking a lot and smoking at a dangerous age (50s). All of this makes me wanna end everything."

Got thrown into a Infrastructure teams out of school, they used Python which I had never used before, started scripting with Python to automate stuff, also used some BASH. Fell in love with the automation work and here I am 2.5 years later.   


Alright so, starting out I just looked up a lot of stuff (still do) and didn't really ""formally"" learn anything about Python. I changed that by going through LPTHW and continuing to use Python at work frequently. Now, I decided for 2021 I want to try and get through a technical book every month, so for Python learning I am doing TDD with Python (Obey the Goat!) for March, and I'm thinking the next book should be Fluent Python, it seems aimed at more intermediate level Python devs who want to get more efficient and learn the lang deeper. I was also considering Effective Python, not sure if that one would be better, or if I should also do it, or if they're about the same. Open to suggestions."

lx4ny7,0,2021-03-03,[AL] Drug Screening on Offer Letter Question,BlindTigerFittyOcho,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/lx4ny7/al_drug_screening_on_offer_letter_question/,"Hey [r/AskHR](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/) !

I recently received an offer letter for an internship position with a bank this Summer. On the offer letter, there was no mention of a potential drug screening. It did of course include all other regular pre-employment screening practices like fingerprint check, criminal background check, and educational record verification. I've come to this sub-reddit to ask if it companies are allowed to drug test (post-offer letter acceptance) if it's not mentioned on the offer letter itself. I have a friend who interned with the same bank last Summer and got drug tested. After cross-checking my offer letter with his, we noticed that his offer letter from exactly one year ago DID mention that he would be drug tested. So, either the bank has changed their pre-employment screening practices or they're just not making note of in the offer letter anymore. Regardless, this has instilled some confidence in me that there's a chance I will not be drug tested, however, I'm too scared to be certain. 

So, I will reiterate my question: **Are companies legally required to include mention of a drug test in the offer letter if it's something they will require before employment begins? If it's not a practice that is legally required, is it a typical or regular practice for companies to include mention of the drug test in the offer letter if they are going to require it later on?** 

I would greatly appreciate any insight from individuals within HR that could help me, even if it does not directly answer my question(s). I'm absolutely terrified and would appreciate anything."

I don't have any work experience, so I really feel like getting an internship this Summer is an absolute must. I'm firmly against starting in Help Desk as well(not that there are any jobs in my area for that anyway). 

So, my biggest problem is that I live in an area that has zero IT jobs. I don't live in bumfuck nowhere, but my area is a tourist beach town in New Jersey - nobody lives here in the Winter. The closest IT jobs are about an hour away - and even then, there aren't very many available. 

Now, I'm not opposed to moving up to 4 hours away when I graduate, but I really think it's important for me to get an internship this Summer, and for that I'm going to need something within an hour or so(maybe a little further, but not much) of where I live. 

Also, I have imposter syndrome pretty fucking bad and I don't feel capable of doing a lot of these jobs, but I'm still applying to the limited listings anyway. Any recommendations or advice for finding that internship?"

lxa2dv,1,2021-03-03,IT Help Desk Position or actually try for SWE?,xkaoticwolf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lxa2dv/it_help_desk_position_or_actually_try_for_swe/,"Hey, so I graduated in Spring 2020 and I've been having an absolute rough time being able to find any jobs at all. Most of the ones in my area(not sure if allowed to say specific region of US)  all require 2+ years of experience for ""entry-level"" jobs.  I managed to snag an interview with a local company for an IT Help desk specialist position through a family friend but I'm not sure if that's going to be a good idea for my long term goals in SWE. I'm also waiting to hear back from my master's program app and I'm not sure I'll end up having time to juggle my 40 hr job and CSMS and being able to work on solo projects later this fall. I'm assuming that I am a decent candidate due to my good GPA (3.4/4.0) but I can't manage to do well in the interviews I happened to get over the past year. I also didn't have any internships when I was studying because I never was accepted to do one. I have had my resume and cover letter analyzed by many people in the cscareers discord and by some professionals so I'm assuming that isn't an issue either. Pay isn't really a problem but the position will pay about average for that type (40-45k) when I'm expecting to be paid 60-75k from any swe in my state. Can anyone give me any guidance on what I should consider doing?"
lxabsq,0,2021-03-03,Help evaluating SWE offer,Massive_bull_worm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lxabsq/help_evaluating_swe_offer/,"I am due to graduate this May and have received a full-time offer at a Defense Contractor within their Space unit as an entry level Software Engineer. This position requires a TS/SCI clearance.

I have spoken with my potential boss, and they stated that I would ""be supporting the development of enterprise products following the DevSecOps philosophy leveraging Agile processes”. Some of the technologies I would be working on or using are: JAVA, VersionOne (Agile tracking), Cloud tech (AWS), Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK), Ansible, Tomcat, Software configuration management tools like Jenkins for builds, code reviews, and source control.

That being said, I previously did Data Science for this very company in my previous position as an intern, and my entire resume has been crafted around my experiences which reflect Python, Data Science, AI/ML, Software Engineering, and Technical (AI) Consulting.

Is this a bad job to take if I have been leaning towards/working in analytics? Why?

Moreover, what sort of second jobs (that also require TS/SCI) could I leverage this first one into after a bit of experience if I accepted? What is the endgame for TS/SCI software jobs? What do they look like?

Lastly, what should total comp look like for a position like this (assume MCOL)?

I am simply worried that I may become pigeon-holed in the defense industry / Java / their version of software engineering (that may or may not fit me). I know this company is amazing to work for, but I still cannot keep but wondering if this will forever negatively alter my career trajectory away from Data Science/AI/ML which is where I really want to continue to be involved in."

Graduated a year ago but still no SWE job landed; want to know what I should do next.



My background:

I graduated last May with a bachelor's degree in math but took enough CS courses to get a minor. I applied to about 150 jobs since last August but most companies haven't gotten back with me. Some of those that have replied have told me the positions have been eliminated or put on hold. Others have said they want more experienced professionals. As for experience, I did a remote internship last year, it went well, but they want their full-time employees to work on-site and I live over 1000 miles away from them. I would prefer to stay in the DC Metro area (my home).

I've been solving coding problems on websites like HackerRank and LeetCode, and have done well on coding challenge tests given to me from various companies I've applied to. I also took some online courses on Coursera and Udemy to learn about topics like Machine Learning and App Development. I have a portfolio of sorts on my GitHub page.



I would like to know what I should do in order to land a SWE/SDE role in either my location or remotely. Should I do more coding challenges, apply to more jobs, go back to school, work on side projects for my GitHub? I'm open to all suggestions, especially from those in (or were in) my situation."
lxbtq6,117,2021-03-03,[CA] I'm legally blind.

I'm trying my best to look for internships or part time jobs where I could work directly with clients struggling with mental health issues. I decided to apply to mental health treatment programs near me (inpatient care, residential treatment facilities, day treatment programs, etc) for direct care staff/mental health technician floor staff positions.

However, I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I am completely blind in my left eye and have 20/200 vision in my right. It's blatantly obvious because I wear glasses with one centimeter thick prism-like concave lenses.

I have chosen treatment facilities where clients stay in one place all day long so it's doable for my limitations (i.e, no home based therapy or field based work driving from client to client). Every place I have applied to – mostly mental health residential treatment facilities – requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc. 

I've managed to land about 5-6 interviews throughout the past month, so I think my resume is pretty good for a college student with limited experience. I do not mention that I am legally blind or anything of that nature on my resume.

However, in every single one of these interviews, things go great until I mention ""I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I do have reliable transportation (paratransit/Uber) to get to work on time and I do not require any additional accommodations otherwise. I just cannot drive clients to appointments or other services in the company vehicle when at the facility. Is that OK?""

I've received the following responses from the program directors that have interviewed me:

-	""Good question. I'm not sure. Let me ask HR and get back to you."" The next day I was told ""Your interview was great and we'd love to have you, but being able to drive is considered an essential function according to HR. If a client has an emergency and needs to go to the ER or something, staff needs to be able to drive them. I'm very sorry.""
-	""Sorry. Our insurance company requires that all employees be able to drive for liability purposes.""
-	""Sorry. We require all of our employees to be able to drive. And no, it can't be another coworker with you who does the driving for you.""

The very last company I interviewed at, a residential treatment center for substance abuse, made my blood boil. I was told during the interview that being unable to drive wouldn't be an issue. I was offered the position – signed the offer letter, W-2, direct deposit information, employee handbook, etc – and turned in all the hiring paperwork. I was then told to expect an email soon from HireRight to proceed with the background check...3 days passed and I hadn't yet received any emails.

Worried, I went back to the website where I had applied for the job – and sure enough, I found the job opening for the exact same position with the exact same shift schedule and pay had been reposted. I called the treatment facility and was told that they had changed their minds, being unable to drive would unfortunately be an issue. Yep...I was essentially ghosted AFTER signing the official offer letter and giving out my social security number, bank account details for direct deposit, etc.

I'm just so frustrated with all this discrimination I'm facing all because I am legally blind and cannot drive a car – all things that are not even within my control. I know I am protected under the ADA. What should I do? Should I file a complaint with the EEOC?"

I also actively network and attend events and competitions in addition to undergrad courses.

Would career growth in the private sector be limited without certs?"

I live in the middle of nowhere in Arkansas and want to move to major city where there is actually stuff to do, culture, ect. However I'm trying to be realistic about my goals. 


Background: I finished college of the summer from a state school with a shit gpa, no internships, and no references. My resume basically just says ""he got through college"". I Don't even have work experience I can put on there cause I quite my job in order to focus on school full time. I really dropped the ball. I'm also a little older than most at 28 ( I had health issues in my early 20's, long story which no one cares about but thats why I went to college later than most). 

Currently I live with my mother who I'm helping take care of during covid (she is high risk so can't really go out much right now). However covid is going to be over before to much longer and I need to get off my ass and get a job. 

Ive got a lot working against me, and I know that. However I have zero doubt in my mind that if I can get that first job I'll be able progress in my career. I'm a hard worker who will get stuff done and done right. But its that first job that the problem. 

Ideally I would get a job as an analyst but honestly I just need to get my foot in the door somewhere in finance before this gap on my resume gets any larger. I'm not opposed to back office work, or whatever work other people typically don't want to do.  But I don't really know where to go from here. I'm currently working on the CFA Investment Foundations Program just so I have something else on my resume but I'm aware that probably doesn't amount for much at all. After that I'll be working on learning some basic python and I'm pretty comfortable with excel at this point. 

So basically in summary. I want to move to a major city, I'm starting my career. Is there any reason to not look for my first job in a major city? will their be more competition? Is there anything I can do to better improve my resume with all this down time I have right now?"

If I were to attempt this, I’d reserve my Data100 work to around 5pm-12am each day for the entire summer term. Is this enough time to invest per day into the summer course to be successful in it?

I just want to start this off by saying.. This subreddit has helped me a lot on what people think within the Finance world. I just graduated out of college in May of 2020. I WAS pre-dental and currently work at a dental clinic as a dental assistant. After many weeks of working there... I realized I do not want to become a dentist. I have seen terrible management, my coworkers have always had terrible dentists as a boss, and it is over-saturated in my area. I cannot emphasize how many offices there are. There are at least 2-3 offices on the same street every time I drive to work. After talking to my cousin (RN as a nurse) and my girlfriend (BIS major and has an internship with Amazon this upcoming summer), I realized that I love Finance way more than any health career profession! I watched my girlfriend take her Finance class and I understood a good portion and enjoyed the class more than she did. 

I just want to ask people (anyone that changed careers) about their experiences and some advice on what to do. My girlfriend recommends me to go back to college for another degree in Finance, intern at any company that accepts me, and apply for an entry-level job.. then climb up there. I do not know much about the business side since I was confined and shaped within the science field. The only experience I have with business is that I took Accounting, Entrepreneurship, Communication, and Marketing. They were to help me see what people in business worked on. 

I also want to know what I can do with a Finance degree if it is worth it. I have been researching on what to do, salary (jealous of my girlfriend because her major is in high demand but I understand she has worked her a\*\* off so I am happy for her in the end), and anything within the Finance field. I love to research companies (especially about stocks) and want to learn more about them. I feel terrible because I studied for 4 years for something I am not happy about and resorted to wasting a good chunk of my life for nothing...

Please let me know what y'all think I should do, if it's worth going back to college for a Finance degree, what there is to do in Finance, and if I have any chance in the business world... 

Just want straight answers without beating around the bush. I understand the business world is hard so don't hold back. 

P.S. currently working on certifications in Microsoft 365 and thought about IT (Idk if IT and Finance can be together, just heard IT is used a lot in the business world)"

So, you read the title. I'm from East Europe, Romania to be precise. And lo and behold, I want to move to West Europe.

My plan is this:

* Start a Master's in Software Engineering or Databases in Romania. I cannot do a CS Master's in West Europe because I am getting my Bachelor in Management Studies. While in Romania I can just take an exam and be accepted at the Master's, I do not think I can do the same thing in West Europe if I did not graduate from a more technical Bachelor's program (credit requirements and all that)
* Do some local or international internships with Erasmus (exchange program for students in the EU, for those of you that do not know)
* Find a job in tech in Germany, Belgium or Luxembourg
* Enjoy life

Now, just be honest with me and tell me what are the chances of my plan being a success if I put in the work. I sincerely do not care if I have to study astronomy to move to West Europe, I just want to move.

I'm currently studying web development. But my preferences can adapt to the chances of getting a job. If web development was less saturated, I would totally continue on that path. But as it stands right now, I have to specialize in another niche, like mobile or something else, to increase my chances.

Again, my goal right now is to increase my chances of getting a job in the west, so what I study can adapt to that. If you have any suggestions, feel free to bring them up.

So, what do you think? Is my plan feasible or not?"

lxgxvs,1,2021-03-04,My depression and anxiety completely ruined my college experience,nihilistrainbow,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lxgxvs/my_depression_and_anxiety_completely_ruined_my/,"I'm a senior in college and I'll be graduating in December with a biology degree. I've struggled with my mental illness for all of my life, but it got really bad my sophomore year, and it only got worse. I developed test anxiety about this time last year. I was at the point that I was missing classes because I could not get out of bed and I was actively self harming. Last semester I had to take a leave of absence because my university didn't want to be liable if it escalated.

I feel like I've missed out so much because of my mental illness (and hypothyroidism that I only recently found out I have). A lot of my friends have done internships and research projects, but I haven't because I've exhausted myself with just trying to get through school work. Unfortunately my mental illness doesn't just make me emotionally unstable, but I have to deal with fatigue and chronic pain. I've had opportunities, but I had to give them up because I had to think about my health. 

I also have intense social anxiety. I've basically had it forever and I'm still struggling with it. I know a lot of opportunities I've bypassed because of it. I'm too scared to talk to professors. Thinking about an interview for an internship stresses me out because the last time I had an interview like that I majorly messed it up. When I'm not falling apart I feel like I can talk a little bit more, but when I am falling apart it gets so bad.

And just in general I haven't fully enjoyed college. It's hard right now for everyone because of COVID, but even before that I was miserable. Classes I thought I would love I would come out hating because they were so hard for me. Not just because the content was difficult, but because the time and brain power I had to put into it. It's hard to do that when you're depressed and have brain fog and your body is in pain all the time. I even took an art class because one of my hobbies is art, and I ended up hating it so much. I haven't been enjoying my sorority like I used to because it just feels like another thing on my plate, I've been a bad member and have skipped things because I just can't do it.

I just wish that I would've taken a gap year when I started getting bad so I could've gotten actual therapy and had the time to try out different medications. I would've been overall feeling happier and I think I would've been been in the right headspace to do research and apply for internships. I've been thinking about going to grad school, but now I just made it so much harder for myself because I'll have no experience. I feel like even getting a job in the fields I'm interested will be hard.

I know people will say that me just getting through college, hell, just being alive despite my mental illness is amazing and makes me a strong person, but I still feel like I'm not good enough. I'm not strong enough, I'm not smart enough, I'm just not ENOUGH."

(working students),anelad_hin,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/lxmk6e/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_get_good_or_even/,"Hi all, I recently started a part-time job at an engineering company. I'm finding it really hard to get into since I only work there for 15h/week. I've had summer internships before, where I worked at a company full-time for 1-2months. There, I always found that after around 3 weeks I kind of got the hang of things (as in: no longer needed to ask for help a lot, able to finish some tasks by myself).

However, I've been at this job for a little over a month and still everything I do seemingly takes forever and I just feel like an incompetent mess whenever I'm there (basically the way I've felt at other jobs for the first week or so).

I realise that this is in part due to the fact that I don't spend a lot of time at that job and I can't really use much of my free time to do additional research etc because I'm also a full-time student.

Does anyone have a similar experience? How long did it take you to be able to be somewhat competent at a part-time job while also getting your degree?

If so, what accommodations did you receive?",grayandgaye,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lxmlhr/have_you_disclosed_your_adhd_to_your_employer_if/,"Hi everyone - I'm weighing my options on whether I should disclose my diagnosis to my employer. As context, I've been at this job for almost two years now (started as an intern out of college, and have been full-time for over a year and a half) and I feel valued and respected at the company. I'm currently slated for a promotion and I'm hopeful about getting it.

One consistent piece of feedback that I've received is about time management and planning ahead. My work is highly collaborative, and I sometimes struggle to give accurate estimates on when I can finish something, or take on too much without realizing and end up struggling to get it all done. I am taking medication (Adzenys 15.7mg + Adderall IR as needed) and while the meds help greatly with focus and accomplishing tasks, they don't help as much with the time management/planning ahead. 

I don't want those challenges to cost me the promotion, nor do I want it to look like I'm not trying to improve on those things. So, I'm wondering if I should tell my employer about my ADHD. My company is progressive and I believe they'd be understanding and flexible, but I guess I fear that coming out now with the disclosure would seem like a cop out or something after receiving that feedback - especially because we're in annual reviews right now. 

Have any of you disclosed your ADHD to your employer? How did it go over? What kind of accommodations did you ask for or receive? Any advice for this situation?

I worked random jobs in different industries until August when I could finally (and freely) pursue my dream. This occupation had been my dream since I was a teen and I was delighted to get accepted on a non-salary probationary verbal contract as it was a foot in the door. I was working part time while I was trying to get my dream going, however so many covid hurdles came and it just made everything impossible. I basically couldn’t do the job I was meant to because of covid restrictions. Things went stale, and I tried my luck with another employer (again non-salary and commission based this time). I felt as though this employer because he was the lead of a much, much smaller set up was trying to shaft me into doing free work. I work 40hr work weeks (in a dreadful min wage job I hate btw) and for weeks was going home and working my ass off and realised that along with covid (making the job impossible by normal standards), because of my situation, he would be winning from any clients I brought him, while I’d be left with 40% commission of an already tiny percentage. Anyway.. I justly cut him loose and gathered my thoughts and decided that I should just follow the law path as this would be the more straight forward and ‘safer’ path to take with an established career path that I can follow and stick to. Especially in times like these, stability is everything. 

For weeks now, I have been job hunting HARD, applying for anything I see that is a legal entry level role (paralegal roles mainly). I am pouring every last minute in the day I have spare to writing cover letters, adjusting my cv, and generally scouring the internet in the hope of finding something. I hear nothing back or I get to the interview stage and get rejected. I don’t know if they can see the lack of passion in my eyes, or if it’s because I have no experience in the industry. There are some areas of law that excite me but I either have no experience in them or they are niche areas and therefore can’t find anything in them for me. 

I swear to God, I come across so many adverts and they all want damn experience. How the hell am I supposed to get experience if nobody is willing to give me a damn chance?! For some flavour, I have no experience because I never planned on going down the law route as I said above... I have called high street firms in my local area, and even asked for work experience. I come from a not very well-off socio-economic background and all I want to do is change my parents’ life as well as give myself a brighter future. At this point I don’t even care if it’s not doing something I love.. sorry I digress. I have applied for internships, you name it... NOTHING. ZERO. ZILCH. 

I am really on the brink of losing my mind, my current job contract runs out at the end of the month, at which point I will be unemployed. It looks really bleak. My parents who are divorced don’t understand my situation. My father has been unemployed/self-employed for years and feels like he has given up on life - he just doesn’t understand my situation or frustrations at all. I have nobody to help me and it feels like my life is slipping away from me and I am falling further toward a bland, meaningless, uninteresting and uninspiring life where I just wait to die. I don’t want to end up there, but I feel like it’s where I’m headed at with my current trajectory and by just being realistic. 

I’ve never thought about death so much than just lately. I feel like if there was a better place for me to end up then I’d rather be there because I can’t do this anymore. It’s breaking me. I feel empty and without any hope or optimism about my future for the first time in my life.

I write this as I sit at the desk of my torrid job where I try not to tear up at the thought of my bleak future. 

If there’s anyone willing to advise me, I’d appreciate it. I’d appreciate if you’ve even bothered reading this far."

I'm a final year compsci student hopefully due to graduate in a few months time, and I have a couple of questions pertaining to that:

- I failed the first year of an embedded computing course when I was 19, and didn't go back to university until 2017. I'm now due to graduate a plain computer science BSc as a ""mature"" student at 26 with no relevant career experience. Is that going to count against me when I apply for jobs?

- I'd really like to do a masters, but in the UK the postgraduate funding is only just enough to cover your tuition costs. Because of that, and because I'd like to get some career experience as soon as possible, I've been looking for a paid year's work placement after I graduate. The vast majority of placement schemes I've seen only seem to be considering undergraduates on the second year of a sandwich course, and because of the one year I spent on the failed embedded computing course, I wasn't eligible to get funding for a four-year sandwich.

I set up a local nodejs server on my computer with a local MySql database and got everything working nicely together. 

Finally it was time to move onto the web so we used GoDaddy for a domain and hosting.

GoDaddy gives my a cPanel to configure the server, and there were several options for ""installing applications"", but none for node.

  
I don't know how unorthodox my solution was but I simply installed node through ssh and cloned my server code into a folder, edited the .htaccess file, and it worked.

The only thing I had to change was all the server routes had to be prepended with public\_html/

I run the server by using &lt;code&gt;nohup npm start &amp;&lt;/code&gt;.

  
I'm mostly curious if this is anything like a professional backend dev's experience and what is janky or might not work in the long-run, or won't scale?

For those who read this, I thank you for your time and input. I apologize if it seems like I am going off on a tangent. I am just trying to give a better understanding of where I am at in my career and to give as much information as I can. The purpose of this post is to ask for advice of potential paths for the fields I am trying to get into.

To clear up any questions, I am going to give some background information. I have a bachelor's in history (queue the jokes). Yes, I wanted careers in that field but those jobs are limited in my area and they only ever offer unpaid internships and I can't afford to work for free. I don't regret getting it, though. I currently work in the utility industry. I thought the experience would help me move to a better position or transfer to another industry under the same position title. It has not and I really don't like working in that industry. I am unable to relocate because I'm married and we both work. I have always been wanting to get an IT related job or something I can actually analyze, plan, and have a little more freedom to design something or work independently. I also love troubleshooting and solving problems. I knew how to code in C++ and some java in high school and can relearn other languages. I understand hardware due to my interest in it from building PCs. I also greatly value my time. I put a lot of value on spending time with my family, friends, and improving my skills and knowledge. I would prefer to not have to constantly work OT like I currently do in the utility industry but I understand it is required with most jobs. I just don't want to do it regularly.

That being said, are there any positions I can get, for example, systems analyst or intermediate role in IT without having to start from square one (help desk) again? I have already had many different jobs before and during college like sales and cold-calling and just don't have the patience anymore to deal with someone yelling at me on the phone for not having all the answers. I read from other threads that it is very stressful and has long hours with not much to gain. I wouldn't mind working in a physical location to help people, perhaps in an office building or shop. I don't necessarily mind starting at entry level, but I want to know if there are other positions other than working at a call center. I know certs could help get my foot in the door. I can get an a+, net+, sec+ and more, but without experience no one is going to hire me - especially not at an intermediate role. So what are potential career paths and other entry level positions in the IT field (or if someone has another industry idea that relates) that I can get from certifications and without going back to school? I'm currently studying for the a+

If there is something that I'm not even thinking of in terms of career path that someone thinks could be a good alternative, I'm all ears! I always try to keep an open mind and learn new things.

I appreciate your time reading this and your advice. I would be grateful for serious/helpful responses because I am genuinely curious into getting into IT. I apologize for the potentially repetitiveness and vagueness. I want to keep my options open."

I am currently in the DMV Area and I am graduating this May with a BS in Information Systems with a focus on Networking/Cybersecurity. Experience wise, I have worked as a research assistant and currently interning at a company. At my current internship, I am spearheading the migration of our cloud application into an ""on-prem"" solution running on Azure. I have great time management and project management skills, and I always take the initiative to lead group projects in my courses. My GPA is above 3.9. I have a couple of certifications under my belt (Net+, Sec+, AZ900, working on AZ104).

**My dilemma**

One thing I keep wondering about is why are people rushing to work right away after college? Like this is time you probably won't get back to take a break because once you start working...well you keep working. So why not take this time to do something you really like doing? For me it's reading, studying for certifications, spend more time with my SO, etc. I know this kind of thinking does not apply to everyone because some people really need the money to work but for me I am grateful to have my parents to back me up in case I don't get a job right away. 

**My plan**

I plan to take 2-3 months off after graduating and probably sometime within that period start applying to full time jobs. Probably look for jobs in the DMV area, but will consider relocating.

**Your thoughts**

What do you guys think? The COVID situation seems to have been getting better(?). Would it be more difficult to find jobs still? Should I not be taking the time off during this time?"

I'm enjoying it so far as the people are nice, the pay is good, and I enjoy the work. The only thing is that I would prefer to do a Software or Fullstack eng role. However, I've heard that recuriters won't choose people with SRE experience. I don't think I will be able to get a job at another company during the summer, so should I just take the extension? Or should I spend the summer to work on some projects and stuff?"

The place where I actually shine 🙃:

1. 850+ hours over 5 years volunteering with my local zoo. Duties included reptile handling, special keeper projects where I helped with constructing the Koala exhibit, removing invasive species in the field, promotion out of 500 people to work in the commissary where diets are prepared, public education etc. etc. I can talk more about this if you guys ask.

2. Wildlife Rehab volunteer intern for a year. Fed/handled injured animals from reptiles, to songbirds, raptors, mammals, etc. Cleaned cages. Provided enrichment and filled out data sheet.

3. Researched endangered California Condors after getting a scholarship for a camp at Big Sur State Park.

4. Questbridge College Prep Scholar. I chose not to become a National Merit Finalist because I didn’t want to go to an Ivy. I didn’t like the pretentious/elitist vibe that some Ivy kids have. We all struggle with pride; I don’t want to be boastful (obviously not all Ivy ppl are like this, but you get me). None of the ivies had a major that was titled in wildlife either.

5. Joyce Ivy Foundation member. I eventually became a Fellow as well who mentors other young women in the Midwest .2 years

6. National Honors Society tutor/peer mentor 2 years

7. Student Advisory Board 2 years

8. Steve Harvey and ESSENCE Magazine’s Disney Dreamer Academy. 10,000 apply, 100 get in. You go to Disney World for free, network with famous ppl/high-up people in careers, and learn career skills. Life-changing experience. 

9. (Insert the university in my city I don’t feel comfortable saying) Excel Scholar. College prep program for minorities that would have given me a full ride to the university. 5 years.

10. Attorney General’s Ohio Teen Ambassador program. 1 year

11. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources Conservation Teen Advisory Council. I became a Team Chair for my region in the state and created an initiative to combat litter in my city, particularly in and near waterways. 1 year.

12. This was with the zoo, but is still significant; I did reptile research. Species included the endangered Blanding’s turtle, painted turtle, endangered spotted turtle, common snapping turtle, the threatened Kirtland’s snake, etc. 2 years?

13. Upward Bound 1 year

14. Attended Yale Young Global Scholars virtually (solving global challenges section, which had a strong climate change/environment component). Note that I was accepted into Notre Dame’s Leadership Seminar (full scholarship), into a Brown University college class, and into Ohio State University’s Stone Lab program (with a scholarship), but I didn’t attend because YYGS conflicted/covid. Joyce Ivy paid for the full cost!

15. Leadership Institute at the zoo/education committee member for zoo volunteer program 2 years

16. Recently started monitoring breeding raptor (owl/eagle/hawk/falcon/etc) populations at my local metroparks 

17. Wildlife Leadership Academy wildlife photography specialist

**Letters of Recommendation**

Lady in charge of NHS at my school (I thought 6.5/10 because we’re not that close, but I guess it was a 10/10 because she was the recommender for a full-tuition scholarship I got)

AP English teacher: I LOVE THIS DARNED LADY. 10/10 easily. We still keep in contact. She made my writing skills immaculate.

(Favorite teacher)Enviro Science/old bio teacher teacher: 1000/10, recommender for most of the scholarships I got/the common app. She spoke about me on the news. She always has nice stuff to say.

**Interviews**

I didn’t have any interviews to get into college, but I did for the scholarships, so I guess I’ll go over those???

[Cameron Impact Scholarship](https://www.bryancameroneducationfoundation.org/scholarship) full-tuition finalist: I THOUGHT it was a 9/10, but I didn’t get it. This was my very first scholarship interview, and it was the only outside scholarship interview I got. I thought that I had made REALLY good connections with the interviewers, but oh well. I noticed a pattern where most of the recipients came from extremely high-ranked private schools.

[Northern Michigan University Presidential Scholarship](https://nmu.edu/admissions/scholars): Competition was fun, but it made me quite nervous (almost threw up, but I do have a severe anxiety disorder. You see, my mom told me that if I didn’t get a full-ride, I wouldn’t be able to go to college because of our finances ). Interview was quick, just 25 min. I connected with the interview really well because we both are interested in PhDs and we are both first-gens. 9/10, I GOT MY FIRST FULL-RIDE. 

[Michigan Technological University Leading Scholar Competition](https://www.mtu.edu/admissions/scholar/): Essay was the best I ever wrote imo, 100/10. The competition was fun, but I had to compete with 200 other which was scary! That was a 8/10. The interview was with a hippie wildlife biologist. We literally just chatted about how cool animals are and life in general. The lack of structure made me nervous, though. 8.5/10. Got the full-tuition scholarship ❤️ (a full-ride if you count financial aid).

Purdue Honors College [Beering Scholarship](https://honors.purdue.edu/current-students/beering-scholars/index.php) . One of, if not the most valuable scholarships in America. Covers cost of attendance for bachelors, masters, + the choice of a PhD, finishing vet school or med/pharmacy. This is ideal for me because I want to get my PhD so I can become a wildlife professor/do my own research. Interview was very short; just 25 minutes with *eleven* people on the zoom call. It made me very nervous, but we ended up talking about cats for a little bit, which was nice. 
7.5-8/10 due to anxiety. GOT THE SCHOLARSHIP TODAY AYYYYY PURDUE 2025


**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Common app statement: basically the whole “ive been passion about animals since I was 7 and delved into books/ here are all of my fun experiences that show how I’ve stocked to that passion and worked towards it). I talked about my crappy financial background. I promise it sounded a LOTTT better in actual essay form 😅. 9/10, I’m still not a perfect writer, and I kind of wish the essay was more unique/“quirky”, but I guess it worked?

Michigan Tech Scholarship Essay: Prompt was to literally create your own question and answer it. I thought of the question “Are young people really able to help the environment?”, and I talked about Greta and other young environment/climate change activists. Then I mentioned all of my work over the years, blah blah blah. Best essay I ever wrote though. 100/10

Purdue Honors College/Beering essay: Some of the most exhausting essays I’ve ever written. Very long and tedious, but obviously worth it. The honors college essays basically wanted you to talk about the pillars of the honors college on their website and relate them to your life. The Beering Scholarship essay wanted you to talk about a problem that students go through during the college app process. I talked about how many people don’t know what they want to do, and I contrasted it with how I’ve been blessed enough to know what I want to do basically my whole life. Like I said, exhausting. I thought I did a bit beyond mediocre in the Beering essay. Guess I didn’t. 7-7.5/10

Ohio State University Honors College essays and  [Morrill Scholarship for Minorities](https://odi.osu.edu/undergraduate/msp): *TRIGGEGR WARNING, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION* 

wrote a very detailed essay on racial discrimination/bullying I’ve experienced, being the only minority/black kid in the majority of the schools I’ve been too (touching/pulling hair, being trampled/called slurs/arm twisted, pinned against a chair). My writing kinda sucked to me tbh. 6/10, but I did get the full tuition (not full-ride) version of the scholarship. *END OF TRIGGER WARNING*

With the honors college essay, I got to choose a fictional character that I really connect to! I chose Samwise Gamgee 💕 and talked about my urge to help others and love for nature. Fun essay, but I feel that my writing could’ve been better. 7/10. I also applied to their full ride +$3000 enrichment scholarship called the Eminence Scholarship, but I could have been rejected because I already got a scholarship. (Or it could have been because I submitted it 5 minutes to the deadline and did a crappy job. Whoops).

**Decisions. ALL decisions for me were EA***

*Acceptances:*

Purdue University West Lafayette+ Honors College w/ Beering scholarship 31000+ students applied to Purdue, 100 chosen to apply, I think somewhere between 5-8 including me probably got it, based on the past years, but who knows. (COMMITTING 💛🖤💛🖤)

* The Ohio State University+Honors + full tuition (go bucks ❤️🤍)

* University of Delaware + Honors (I was about to do another full-ride competition, but I just got the Beering Scholarship at Purdue which trumps everything, so I’m cancelling).

* Michigan Technological University w/ full-tuition (full-ride with financial aid)

University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) w/ honors +20,000 a year

Ohio University (Athens). Probably would’ve been a full-ride if I actually wanted to go/applied to the scholarships they left in my voicemail lol

Colorado State University, 10,000 a year

Applied to the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a half-joke, got 8000 a year 🤣

University of Maryland, Washington State University, and Iowa State University (11,000 a year) were withdrawn. I have a suspicion that Iowa State was about to give me their full-tuition George Washington Carver scholarship for minorities before I withdrew.


*Waitlists:*

None :)

*Rejections:*

None :)

**Additional Information:**

In short, what do I think made me an outstanding candidate?: Having a huge set of extracurriculars/experiences/honors that *clearly* related to my major. That, and my passion is pretty clear. At least, all of the people who gave me scholarships said that that’s what they noticed. *ALWAYS* apply to the honors college if you want a better chance of getting $$$. Some scholarships (usually the huge ones) *require* you to get in the honors college.

If ANY of you guys want advice/have questions, don’t hesitate to dm or comment!! I love you all ❤️

Also, please don’t leave any hate/controversial comments. Lots of members of my family aren’t even happy for me, and it’s a lot to go through."

During my studies I realized that I didn't really like what I was studying, but I finished my bachelor's degree and I decided not to continue. My resume is almost empty, except for a few years of copywriting experience and a month-long internship at the court of my city. My financial situation does not allow me to obtain a new scholarship to possibly undertake a new bachelor degree and despite all my efforts I cannot find a job. I have sent my resume to various companies, I have applied on a myriad of job search websites, including linkedin, but for 8 months now I have only had an interview from which I have not heard from. It's really frustrating, as I don't know how to get out of this situation where I don't know what I would like to do in my life but at the same time I can't find any kind of job. If I could, I would work and stop studying, but apparently my bachelor's degree in Political Science and International Relations does not allow me to find any work. Maybe it could serve as an experience doing an internship abroad, but my few applications for internships were also rejected. I honestly don't know what to do anymore..."

I had an interview with a tech company last week, and it went great.

He said that he definitely wanted to hire me and was going to fill out the paperwork for an offer, but to go for that other interview and make my own choice. The other interview was today, and I haven't heard back about the first position (which is the one I think I'll accept). Should I be worried? How long should I wait to reach out?"

Where my ladies at?? I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of constantly trying to prove myself just because I'm a female in computer science. My grade only has 15 women in computer science out of 100 people. There's like 2-3 other women in my courses, and I'm just tired of it always being this way. The guys almost never take what I have to say seriously, and if a guy answers a question that I actually said earlier, suddenly everyone else believes it. Constantly getting belittled in my abilities is only the start. 

This morning, we had a breakout room and they were talking about how our professor sounds really cranky over emails. Someone in response said that it must ""be his wife that sends his emails then."" I know that not all guys are sexist or misogynistic, but dang... it gets tiring when you're around the ones that are. 

OH but not to mention the ""you only got those internship offers because you're a girl."" I somewhat agree, that probably plays a little bit of a role in companies decisions; but that doesn't mean I didn't do countless hours of LeetCode, fill out 132 applications, work hard in my courses, fail coding interviews, and keep up with sexist slums everyday.

Anyways that's just a little rant, hoping things get better when I'm in industry and HR is a thing :/"
ly23y8,1,2021-03-04,Gaming and not being able to reduce time in it.,Takahashi_Raya,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ly23y8/gaming_and_not_being_able_to_reduce_time_in_it/,"Upfront I wanna say I'm not addicted or anything really I don't feel a need to do it or anything.  


My current dilemma that I would love to hear some advice for is one that is kind of difficult for me. I'm a student that is going for a bachelor's right now and am able to finish all my  work up fairly easily. Due to corona I had to re-do  a class which slowed me down a bit because the initial stages of covid kind of screwed me over in a group project. (long story short, Hardware did not arrive which caused us to be fully stuck and fail the class by about 0.1 point of passing.) 

This gave me a rather decent amount of free-time and has caused me to pick up Drawing as a hobby since I used to do it a lot and due to certain reasons I won't mention I dropped it. I'm truly enjoying involving myself in art again and am thinking of striving forward to practicing enough to get to the point I could do it as a side job.

The problem is I'm an avid gamer always have been but I wanna invest more time into practicing art as well as practicing coding for uni. But I can't seem to get in a mindset of reducing my hours of gaming not because I'm addicted and  now this is gonna sound kind egoistic I guess. But because I'm generally good at games. I am very competitive and feel it is wasted potential if I reduce the hours I invest in games I play. And because of that I usually push towards being in the upper echelon's in MMO's or competitive games like League,CSGO,Overwatch,Osu!,etc.

now my issue is I have to juggle Learning code ( which I'm doing by doing 1 hour a day with no compromises on that i started doing this this week since in half a year I need to do an internship. ), Developing my art skills all over again since I lost most of mine, And my competitive nature in gaming.

I have an immense fear of failure on-top of all this which kind of makes it even more difficult it used to be held in check a lot for me when I was heavily investing into badminton when I was younger. But due to my weak ankle's I had to quit.  I'm now at the point of my life (25 years old) where I have to start getting this under control or it's going to be a disaster once I graduate in 2 years. ( I already have 2 vocational degrees if you wonder why I'm only in my second year of uni at this age)  


So what I'm mostly asking is if someone has had similar experiences be it gaming or something else that impeded their lives in the same way my competitive nature is doing it to mine. It would be nice if someone could give me some form of advice.

I also kinda want a check on my mindset and see if I have a misplaced view of the industry and the competitiveness.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have my Data Structures and Algorithms final of Saturday (Please God help me). I have been trying to fit in some leet code problems throughout my days and I have been applying to tons and tons of internships for the summer. I currently am working an internship as a System Admin which is fine, its been about 3 months now; however, I am doing hardly any coding. I work closely with servers and I perform updates (backing up, running scripts, etc..) I got in contact with my boss and asked to be transferred to the development side. Good news! He got in contact and I was assigned some videos to watch, these are all word document template videos. The issue is, I am pretty certain I won't be established under that development side really at all. I think I will get a day or two of training with the Dev team and that will be that. The application is just a web application for the most part with not too much of a backend. I currently work this job about 25 hours a week. All of this sounds great, but I am leaving out a part.

I am also a highschool student, a senior who is graduating this year. I feel extremely stressed and overburdened. At the end of this semester I will have 60 and some odd credits upon my graduation at highschool which is good I guess; I should add, I have been attending community college to get this education. It is curse at the same time. In college, I will graduate in 2 or 3 years max, this puts me in the position where I should be looking for internships right about now.  I have a decent education for them: the aforementioned data structures and algorithms, HTML, CSS, Python. I am currently learning DJango and Flask. With all this being said, I am averaging a 5 or so hours a sleep a night and get hardly any exercise (I used to frequent the gym). I feel stressed because I know I need to continue to study and work towards getting an internship with how competitive the industry is. I currently have a 3.81GPA as well which I thought would be beneficial. I think by this point I have applied to well over 200 jobs and I have got 3 responses. All of which I ended up being rejected from. I think this summer I will grind out more leetcode and learn more stacks. I didn't mention my personal projects but basically my main one has been a giant automated social media account system. I run two bots on twitter, one that combats mis-information, and one that tweets out two quotes a day. I also run a bot on Instagram that tweets a quote on a picture. I then use the respective API's to collect data and backup  daily reports to a google drive account.

I’m a third year finance &amp; econ student from a reputable university in Canada with good grades. 

I’m involved in some student clubs and previously had one internship with a small bank researching projects for the firm (nothing too financially stimulating). 

Most recently I’ve started looking into PE firms, their industries, financial models. At first I thought I wouldn’t like PE but now that I’ve looked into it, had some coffee chats, etc I’m starting to think it may be what I wanna do with my career. 

I have no investment banking experience and my LBO/valuation skills are mediocre, non competitive, and really it might not cut it. 

I’m trying to download case studies to do from online and I’m planning to do my first ever stock pitch next week in front of a competitive student group to learn more on DCF/Valuations in more detail. 

I’m kinda rolling into this late seeing as to how students get into knowing all this from their first year (I might be taking an extra year as part time to give me a learning buffer in terms of student involvement). 

I’m going to everyone and everyone to gather all the advice i could get on PE. Whether that is suggesting what technicians I should look for, resources, academics, what to know to master interviews (currently looking at search funds), anything really to help get from A to B as efficiently as possible. I’m dedicated to this goal will give my all to just learn. I’m interested in the software/tech industry."

Okay, I'm a computer technician (still an intern, I'll be a tech in about a year) but I've tried everything and my friends too, I even asked teachers and they where kinda confused so you're my only hope.

I have a laptop with double boot, Fedora 33 and Windows 10. 
When I updated Fedora a few months ago my computer didn't loaded the GRUB anymore, that happens to me every time I update or put a new SO so I knew how to fix it, I went to the BIOS and tryed make the computer boot directly from grubx64.efi. The thing is that all the bios was greyed out.

After playing for like a week with it I ended up with the conclusion that I forgot the administrator password of the BIOS, and I was happy because I knew how to reboot that: I only had to take off the CMOS battery.

I put on my gloves and open my laptop to find that the battery was WELDED to the board. I talked with a teacher about it and she said that some laptops have the battery welded to force planned obsolescence. 
I'm not confident enough to de-weld the battery so I just closed the laptop and look for more things.

At the end I was abled to boot the Fedora using CMD to force the computer to boot from the grubx64.efi file. But I still wanted the BIOS to work.

So I looked for more answers, I found out that I could boot from DOS with a USB live and use commands to reset it. I decided to do that yesterday.

I tryed to boot it with Rufus and the computer didn't detect the usb as a bootable, so I tried with unetbootin and it didn't work either, I changed different ISOs, I didn't it from the terminal, EVERYTHING, OKAY??

I tryed with booting from the same usb key a ubuntu iso using rufus and it worked, so it wasn't the program nor the key.

A friend let me his ventoy multiboot usb because he said that it worked for him, 30 minutes ago I plugged the key, tried to boot from there and it just appeared a friking GIANT lock in the screed that said basically that I wasn't able to open it because secure boot was anabled.

So now I'm here: My bios is greyed out, freezed in secure boot mode and the only thing that was my only hope needs me to take the secure boot out. 

What the hell can I do? This computer is almost 5 years old but I wasn't planning on buying a new computer yet and now I'm kinda limited...."

I just feel really lost on what area in tech I want to pursue- I feel like CS dominates my academic life, but coming into the major late without any personal projects or internship experience under my belt, I just feel like I have no shot at most of these SWE internships. I've been applying but haven't gotten any interview offers, which sucks because that's the type of shit I'm actually really good at, and I know I'd kill it in a coding interview.

I realized over the course of this past month while applying to internships that UX design sounds like exactly what I want to do-- the only problem is I have no portfolio and most of the UX internships require one (even when they aren't explicitly required, I feel like I have no chance without a portfolio). I feel like it's too late to get into it now since this is my last summer before I graduate, and since it's already March I don't know if I'll be able to build a decent portfolio by the end of this recruitment season.

1. Does anyone have any advice on what to do from here? I just feel late to the game and under-experienced compared to everyone else in every field I'm potentially interested in-- haven't taken enough upper divs for AI/ML stuff, haven't done enough personal projects/past internships for SWE, haven't built a robust enough portfolio for UX... Should I just keep applying since it's already late in the recruitment process, or is it worth it to delay applying and spend a little time trying to complete a coding project or add a UX project to my portfolio before I keep applying? Do I have any chance at getting a UX internship with no portfolio?
2. I'm considering taking a ninth semester so that I can take more upper divs, maybe try to do the BCDI certificate, and have another summer to intern before graduating so I can build my portfolio. Does anyone know of any clubs/classes where I could get some experience with UX and work on projects to build my portfolio? I'm the kind of person that is way more motivated by external deadlines/other people so if anyone has any advice or clubs they know of that would be much appreciated

Sorry for the looooong post, just feeling v hopeless and idk what to do, any advice would be amazing"

So, I am thinking about to apply for the summer 2022, but after the spring 2022, I will become a Junior. However, the period that I am actually applying for the internship, I will still be a sophomore.

lyds9g,423,2021-03-05,[Uni][JC] Arguably the biggest question you should ask yourself before/during university,broskiunited,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lyds9g/unijc_arguably_the_biggest_question_you_should/,"TLDR:

You're paying for UNI. Make sure you get something out of it, whatever ""something"" is.

### What exactly is University for?

What's up guys, it's me again with another article I wished I had read before entering university.

**What do you hope to get out of university?**

Before diving in, a quick overview of what University is:

* It's a product — you're paying for a product and/or a service
* There is no fixed goal anymore - unlike JC/Secondary/Primary, where there is a clearly defined end goal
* Final ""checkpoint"" before you enter the working world - last chance to make giant mistakes and still get have the ""I'm a student sir, please forgive me"" card to play (No ""bright future"" jokes"" please)

Now, you are probably thinking: ""Oh broski, what you've listed is very obvious. Almost anyone can spend 5 minutes and come up with those three points!

### The problem is: Not many people actually think about it!

It's so easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life, have results, apply to whichever has the highest median salary or hype and be done with it.

Now, I'm not saying the course you go to will have a huge and irreversible impact on your life (RE: prev. article). However, all I am saying is that: *It's important to think about all of this and the points I've stated.*

To me, the absolute worst thing is to be a cog and go:

* Okay, done with A's. On to University.
* Select Course X because Mom and Dad said this is for the best + high demand in the market
* Study hard and do well in the course because everyone else is also doing that
* Things will fall into place nicely

To me, this is incredibly problematic and was how I did things for a period of time, driving me to pen this article.

### Ok, fine broski, I'll bite. So what now?

Now, we talk about *potential objectives. Some* caveats before you come after me with a pitchfork.

1. The list of objectives is not exhaustive → I just tried my best to structure it into ""buckets"".
2. You **never EVER** need to lock in your objective. You can be wishy-washy (like me) and change objectives every other ~~week~~ month.
3. Nothing is set in stone: It is fine to combine or eliminate parts of an objective.

Let's dive right in!

* **Getting a good job out of university:** Ah yes, typical Singaporean culture. Firstly, absolutely *nothing* wrong with this, especially if you come from a lower-middle-income family. If you choose this route, think about the following:
   * What is your definition of a *good* job? &gt; 6,000 starting pay? Company name? The things you do and learn? Size of the company?
   * With that in mind, think about **what you're optimising for.** Internship ASAP in Y1? Sacrificing social life to get a good GPA? Consciously make these tradeoffs and always re-evaluate your goals and existing situation.  

* **Exploring your interests**   
Nice - what is an interest in the first place? It could be something like public-speaking to leadership, community service or even blockchain.  
 I have friends that picked up dancing, boxing and even insect-catching, all in university. I think it's a great idea to put yourself out there and explore.  
 
* **Getting laid and have a f\*\*kton of fun**  
Well, I am sure we have all heard stories. Want to have your body count go from 0 - 50 within a year? Or more interested in just getting hitched asap? Or hitting the bars every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday?  
Excellent, no judgement at all.   
 
* **Having fun and just enjoying yourself**   
This is more of a combination of (3) and (4).  
Perhaps you might think that university is the last stage of your life where you can have fun and explore. Get f\*\*king drunk and blackout, learn something fun like cheerleading or binge-watch Netflix for 15 hours straight. “Forget religion. Forget philosophy. Forget your problems and all your precious ideas. Get busy. Go out and enjoy life.”  
 
* **Growing as a person**  
 A little more nuanced, but ""suffering"" late nights and planning events, getting backstabbed or thrown under the bus by shitty teammates are also things you can experience in university. Leadership, learning to communicate, growing your EQ or even improving your personality - university is truly a place where you can do anything and everything.  
Note that if you have such an objective, you ought to ask yourself the following:
   * What is growth for me? Why do I want to grow in the first place? Cause it sounds cool? What are small baby steps I can take to grow?

Cool - I want to pause here and reiterate a few things.

1. **There is no right or wrong objective to have.**   
Different strokes for different folks.
2. **Change, change and change again.**   
Fuck it. You might enter uni wanting to get a good job, feel like a friendless loser after seven weeks and want to try something else. GO FOR IT!
3. **Mix, match, merge**   
Want to get laid, get into investment banking and have loads of fun? Sure! Whatever floats your boat.
4. **Your only resource is time**   
At the end of the day, it's a game - you have 100 energy and multiple goals to complete. Would you like to clear 20% of each goal? Or 50% of two goals? How about all-in and 100% of one goal? Of course, energy levels differ, but the principle remains the same.

### In closing, the point isn't to say that your objective NEEDS TO BE something in particuar. Rather, it's about HAVING or FINDING something.

**What I want to drive home is to always keep in mind that you're paying for university. It's a product. Make sure you get something, whatever that is.**

### Beyond the $$ you pay for uni...

An even more important resource is *time.* 18 - 25 is arguably the prime of your lives or the start of the prime. Hence, it's even more important to make sure you get some value out of university, given the steep price. (time &amp; money)

Ultimately, I would say that the biggest and root goal of university is growth as a person. That said, growth is incredibly subjective and could be 1 or 2 or 3 or whatever, as addressed above.

It's up to you how to define growth - it is fine to have a definition of growth and change it multiple times - each time of change is a sign of growth in itself.

**That said, I'm not saying to obsess over 'growth', as though you're a startup**

It's more of just being *mindful* of your personal growth and development as a person, your general life direction and goals.

In our world and system, it's is just so f\*\*king easy to drift. Drifting is fine, only if it's intentional. ie. you're drifting and exploring different things.

On the flip side, drifting unintentionally is a no go, at least for me personally.

**A general caveat:**

* Growth can mean different things to different people. It's up to you to find out what resonates.
* Realising that you are not growing, or your current perspective of growth is wrong, is in itself, growth. Find your niche.
* It's fine to chill. Mental health and burnout are legit. Never obsess over growth too much.

### A final note, uni is not the end

Ending off, although the narrative up till now is that uni is the ""final checkpoint"" in your life, I would like to do a 180 and say that is not the case.

In fact, I would say that there are different checkpoints for different people. Please do not feel discouraged if you're finishing up university and feeling regrets after reading this. What I have come to realise is that in itself is growing too!

The key thrust of this article, although it's targeted at uni, is this:

Be cognizant and mindful of what you do. Don't drift.

Good luck and keep in touch.

### Side note #1 Feedback from previous readers

1. Emotional language &amp; profanities Readers have commented that I sometimes might be an overly emotional writer - that the way I write might not be the best. I have tried to tone it down a little, though I am simply a product of what I consume. (re: I consume a lot of ""conversational and emotional"" stuff → hence my style)
2. Adding a big fracking disclaimer What /u/bangmyp\*\*\*\*y said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ltopq4/jcuni_just_how_important_are_a_levels_and_what_if/gp5jq18?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) made a lot of sense. (He is a [self-proclaimed teacher](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lwu69w/rant_feeling_super_guilty_for_bringing_down_the/gpkgm4o/?context=3)) I want to highlight that this post is not for everyone.  

* If you're ""late"" in uni and reading this post and regret how you've spent your time, it is fine.  ""A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams."" - Barrymore
* Stress is great in moderation. What I am is a combination of my *personal* experiences. I might be COMPLETELY wrong. Take everything I say, think about it and distil what is useful to you.

Does that mean larger companies don't look at your code or verify it runs properly and how important is the code in your personal projects for your projects? I assumed that companies used them to understand what your code looks like."

I've a few questions about NUS Business Analytics and Computer science. Thank you in advance for taking time to respond to my questions.

1. I'm considering Business Analytics as im pretty interested in it. Is it worth it to do both a bachelors and masters in BZA or is it better to do a bachelors in CS then masters in BZA? (I might be considering BZA masters in 北大 which covers econometrics, machine learning, media, R and python) (not sure if i can even get in but yeah ""considering"") (but the curriculum seems to kinda overlap BZA NUS curriculum and even slightly more spoonfeeding im not sure actually)


2. I'm more interested in BZA than CS but l think it might be more practical for me to go into CS to open more job opportunities (?). However at the same time I'm worried about the work load to commit. Can those who struggled to choose between BZA and CS share how they managed to chose in the end?


3. I heard the markets now require PHD level data/business analysts. Is this true? What kind of degree are they looking for? What major? (In both the bach, masters, PhD level) 


4. I also heard that BZA might find it hard to compete with CS for coding jobs and also hard to compete with data sci grads with analysts jobs. So BZA might be in a little awk position... Is this true?


5. Can anyone share about the internship experience for BZA? And also how the requirements for internship work for NUS BZA? 


Hope everyone can be open in sharing their views and thank you so much for your time!! Please note that some of my comments might be inaccurate as I have an incomplete understanding of this field."

It’s looking like I’m not gonna have an internship after my sophomore year (only officially switched to a CS major this year). Have any of you gotten a FAANG or otherwise top internship without having any past work experience? I’ve applied like a madman this year but my resume just wasn’t solid enough for this hiring season. I’m sure I’m not the only one in this situation.

I’m also wondering if it’s possible for a rising junior to fit in more than one internship in the last two years of college (maybe by taking a semester off and doing a fall, winter, or spring internship).

Thanks for any advice/encouragement.

Edit: just wanted to add that I’m working on improving my resume and I’m hoping that I will have more going for me by the end of summer. I imagine others here have a similar plan."

It is in a big multinational company, I could have interesting benefits (elearning, selfcare, a cool office \[when the COVID problem will be ""resolved""\]. The thing is, it's not my preferred line of work (SEO).

Now, I'm following a course and through the school I have already set an interview for another position. A less known and smaller company, but it's a coding/webdeveloper position. I think I have a good shot at this one too, and it could the dream job.

I'm so conflicted. Should I decline the first offer and aim for the second position? Or am I being ""choosy"" and nagging? In the current economic situation it feels quite wrong to be this conflicted (so many young adults are having a lot of troubles to find a job).

Update : Cleared first round, got rejected after second. In first round some medium level implementation was asked(I couldn't remember) and projects/internship discussion.  In second round more about projects/ internship in depth plus scalability in those projects. One coding question: Given a positive integer with n digits, remove k digits to make the greatest possible integer after removal. Digits can only be removed either from front or back. Gave a dp approach, which I really doubt interviewer was able to understand but he said nothing , then I coded, for some small issues the code was not running. No help from interviewer.

I have not been that far away from home for that long before, finding housing, etc. and I am afraid that combined with being my first job and with being in a pandemic still with restrictions and isolation it will be too much.

I'm currently in the process of applying to a congressional internship and was wondering if some of you would be willing to provide any feedback. For context, I'm looking at interning at one of the state offices. Here's my first draft.

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Blah Blah majoring in Education with a concentration in History.

I would like to be considered for a summer congressional internship with Senator Blah's (City Name) office. As you can see from my resume, I have been heavily interested in public service and staying engaged in constituent affairs as a Student Representative at my college campus.

My experience as a student representative will make me a valuable member of the (City Name) senate office’s staff. As a member of the Education Faculty Student Council, I reviewed the concerns of fellow students to find solutions to such concerns. On one occasion a fellow student asked if the faculty library could be made available for students who lacked a stable internet connection. After this encounter, I presented a motion to open campus library services for students who lack internet connection which was approved by the Student Council and later adopted by the Campus administration. Additionally, I headed the Council’s Student Needs and Service Evaluation Committee where student’s concerns are constantly discussed and possible solutions are proposed. This experience corresponds with the type of work that I expect to do for Senator Underwood's constituents.

I have also worked extensively with the public. As a tour guide at the San Juan National Historic site, I was able to interact with park visitors making good use of my bilingual capabilities and knowledge of the park’s rich history. I understand the importance of maintaining a courteous relationship with the public. I am eager to apply these skills to the Senator’s constituents.

It is worth noting that though I am currently not a citizen of the state of (Senator's state), I was born in the state and have deep familial ties to it. As a result, the state and the challenges its citizens face are not completely alien to me. A summer internship in Senator blah's (City Name) office would be an opportunity to build on the experience I have acquired thus far and help me gain more experience in helping constituents so I can more effectively serve the members of my community.

Upon graduating from the University of Blah Blah, I plan to seek a master’s degree in school administration from the University of Blah Blah, Blah Blah Campus.

I recently gave early career advice to someone who is going to be a sophomore this year and she suggested that there might be folks here who may be interested/could benefit from the same information. Admittedly, my main experience is in the corporate world, so it may or may not apply best to everyone especially in niche roles. I have, however, throughout the years, have had exposure to practically all levels of employees in an organization (from your service level providers to the CEO/CIO of that org), and there are certainly commonalities that apply to most, if not all, standard American jobs that aren't for start-ups. Figured you may be interested in what that might mean for you in the current state of the world.

Background, I graduated in 2014 for Petroleum engineering, right when oil market essentially had its first crash and since then, I've worked in 3 different industries: oil and gas (2014-2016) -&gt; healthcare IT &amp; project management (2016-2019) -&gt; tech (2020-current). By role, I started out as a reservoir/production engineer, went into project management, and am now in business development/program management. The job market would consider me to be entering my ""mid-"" level career, with is essentially the twilight phase of entry &amp; associate, and into, soon, middle management e.g. team manager, line manager, etc. with approximately 6 years of job experience, with the only thing holding me back from a more optimized path is that I jumped entire industries.  


If you'd like to talk about the subject but have not had the chance to connect with someone to get what you're looking for, I'd be happy to set up a trial run via discord or zoom for a round-table for whoever is interested. Subjects such as internships, early positions, how to move up with or without continued education (certifications, advanced degrees, etc.), are all fair game and expected.  


No price of admission other than your time -- the goal would be that in the future you share the wisdom of your successes to others as well :) The idea would be to meet up maybe once per quarter/half year for folks to participate.

In Riga, I am still trying to understand the situation, but the salary would be of around 1300/1400€ per month.

Which one has the best quality of life? Would working in Stockholm seen as ""better"" than working in Riga? Would it even matter?

Any suggestions, experiences or just some comments are very much appreciated.

I have been trying to get an internship since July, and this is my only offer so far. I don't know if it is worth it or not. I am also unsure if credit administration is something I would like doing. The commute is also terrible. However, I have not gotten any other internship for Summer 2021, and I'm afraid if I decline this offer, I'll never get another internship.

Currently, I have 2 phone interviews next week for other internship positions, but statistically speaking from my internship application experience, I probably won't get an offer from either interviews. The deadline to decide is March 9th. I have asked for an extension, but no replies yet. 

Something that might be important is that this would be my first full-time summer internship ever. If I don't get one for this summer, I might graduate with very little work experience at all. I did have a small remote internship that lasted 1 month this Jan - Feb, but that's about it.

Do IT certifications like CCNA, A+, Security+, Network+, etc. really matter in the long run if one is just trying to get their foot in the door with IT, even for anything at the bottom like help desk or Jr. Tech positions?

Because many people claim the certs matter in the long run, but others say the certs don't hold much value. In a career field like IT, experience matters more than education, but I don't know what is the general census for certifications. Heck, some people have acquired IT certs but still are unable to find any work. This ""job market"" makes no sense these days...

My issue is I'm still trying to get into entry level tech work, but I'm still running into dead ends. Have 2 college degrees and 1 internship. I don't have the funds, nor can I save up, to pursue CCNA and A+ (not even training courses or materials), and I can't even land anything to even make that money thanks to COVID.

Then when I view job listings online for entry level IT work, some listings say they prefer anywhere from like 3-6 years minimum of experience and/or prefer or require certifications, yet... People have said they've landed those jobs without meeting all those requirements, yet you have some systems which won't even consider you if you don't have all these ""minimum"" requirements. Or some positions put you on a probationary period to get the required certs, or they may help you pursue certain certs. Some listings say certs are ""required"", but other listings ""prefer"" candidates who happen to have them, and other listings just say it's a bonus or aren't required.

There's way too much inconsistency!

I just want to get my foot in the door with something like help desk, tech support, desktop support, computer technician, etc., but this cert inconsistency is driving me bonkers.

Is it even worth pursing A+ and CCNA, or is it better to just try and land an entry-level tech job to build up experience?

And do certs even matter when rising the ranks to more intermediate and higher level tech positions?"

Idk I’ve always had to really force myself outta my comfort zone. My first internship I had to tell my parents to just leave me there so I wouldn’t quit and come home early. I wanted to quit my first job for like a solid month and a half until I got into the groove. When I got to college (very very far OOS) I immediately wanted to transfer closer to home and go back, and didn’t bc my parents seemed so proud that I was here (am very glad I stayed, I love this place). I didn’t wanna go to my first party and had to really fight myself to not turn back, and I ended up having a great time. The first date I ever went on, I almost cancelled it like 4 separate times. It was really awkward and I didn’t have fun but I didn’t regret going at all, and it definitely seems easier to plan one now that I’ve done it.

So now. I’m torn about whether I wanna find a relationship and whether it will involve sex. I feel like everyone’s always been like “it’s ok to be a virgin, you should *make sure you’re ready*” which sounds like very good advice. And like I’m *plenty* nervous but it sounds like a move. Then an opportunity arises and I dodge It so hard. my problem is, am I ready and just hiding out in my comfort zone? Or just not ready?

Cuz if I am ready. And I don’t force myself outta my comfort zone. I never will. Like that’s just how I am. But if I’m not ready idk, who knows what that regret might bring.

Do y’all have any advice on how to navigate this situation? Experiences, stuff I can think about, questions I can ask me, whatever? I don’t know how to tell"

So not really too relavent to my degree.

I eventually want to move to anywhere else, and perhaps seek a role relavent to my studies.

Midwest or South are of interest. 

Where is demand strong and supply low for CS majors and developers? And how could I get a developer role with no internship or experience? Portfolio?

The only thing that I have experience with is SQL and I listed the projects on my resume that I did using MySQL Workbench should I just refer to that when asking questions or what are other questions I should know about beforehand.

Dear students,    
 

We hope that you are adjusting well to your Spring semester studies, wherever they may find you.   


I am writing regarding Boston University’s Summer 2021 Study Abroad programs. As of today, March 5, 2021, the University has made the difficult decision to suspend our Summer 2021 Study Abroad programs due to ongoing concerns regarding COVID-19. Multiple factors prompted this decision, including most importantly the sustained global health risk and the well-being of our students, faculty, and staff. We understand that the timing of this suspension may cause great disappointment, as we know many of you planned to study (and intern) away from campus as an important part of your college experience to. We sincerely regret the disruption and inconvenience this decision may cause, especially for those of you who had planned to study abroad in the prior three semesters.   


We are looking into the possibility of offering virtual internship and course options this summer and we will follow up with more information. 


We very much hope to offer our Study Abroad programs in Fall 2021, and the application for those programs is open. The BU Study Abroad staff is available to answer your questions about applying for future semesters. Please visit the Advising Options page of our website for more information and to set up a virtual appointment. Since you applied for a Summer 2021 program, you will not be prompted to pay the application fee again if you reapply for a program in a future semester with BU Study Abroad.  


Please contact us at abroad@bu.edu with additional questions.     


We wish you a safe and healthy remainder of the semester.  


Sincerely,    


Gareth McFeely

I am 23 years old. I have my bachelors degree in Digital Forensics and Information Assurance. I graduated last may and since then have not been able to find a job anywhere. I believe part of it is due to my disability as I’m physically disabled therefore require some accommodations in the work place which I believe has made me a less appealing applicant.

On top of this I have no work experience. I just have the degree itself and nothing else. 

Ideally I want to find a position remotely. If not remote, somewhere in Florida or close to the Denver area in Colorado. 

If anyone has any suggestions on where to go from here it would be very much appreciated. I have applied to many positions and many companies with no luck due to my lack of work experience. If anyone would know of some companies that are hiring entry-level positions in the areas I listed or remotely please point me in their direction. As well as this, if anyone here would be willing to take me on as an intern at their company remotely just for the time being so I can get some experience under my belt and make my résumé more appealing, I would be very interested.

Do you have any tips for this process and what to expect from this process and interviewing  or the position itself? 

Or just in general your experiences having internships or working for Amazon/AWS

And what do you think about the position itself? Im very exited about it for the possibility of eventually being officially hired by Amazon and the growing opportunities within the company to something that is not support and more technical, hell, maybe even developer.

But how often do companies actually hire interns? Is it something common at all?"

Now, my past internships have mostly in software development and full stack development stuff. I am very happy to get this opportunity to work with Lockheed Martin but I am concerned about some things:

1.I enjoy coding very much(C++/Java mainly, will Satellite Systems Engineer position will give me ample opportunity to code. What does a Satellite Systems Engineers every day look like?

2. Will the skills learned from this job are universally transferrable to other stuff if I go looking for other job in few years.

3.I am concerned as a fresh young graduate I will not get to code as much in this position as I am totally new to this sector and I will end up writing stuff like requirements documents, if anyone can guide me what my day to day task will look like I will greatly appreciate."

My AM hasn’t spoken to me for 5 days since I called her out on her controlling behaviour. I’m turning 19 this year and I’m so tired of living like this. I go for regular counselling and after my sucide attempt, I was referred to a psychiatrist but I never went.

When I was 14, my AP put a CCTV in my room to make sure that I was constantly studying and would check the camera every hour. From ages 13-16, my AM would text me everyday to ask what time I would get home and she would always check the CCTV to see if I was home or see whatever I was doing. I couldn’t stay in school after lessons to chill or talk with my friends without being hounded by messages from my AM. Ever since then, I got good grades and worked hard in school. I became the top 5% of students in the nation and got into a prestigious school. I also secured internships at big 4 companies where my bosses were all impressed with me and liked me.

Ever since I hit puberty, it’s like my relationship with my AM turned upside down. I started becoming more mature and skeptical of things once i turned 13. I wanted to go out with friends and be free-er but my AM wouldn’t have that. I started “acting up” in the sense that I would have an annoyed tone. My AM would snap whenever I did and ignore me for days until my AF forced me to apologise. I started getting bullied in school and was having tons of friendship problems that I couldn’t talk to anyone about. My grades started falling and I was getting so overwhelmed with both academic and personal stress.

Whenever I leave the house I have to tell my mom where I’m going, who I’m hanging out with and what time I would come home; and it’s been this way until now. (I’m already 18) Ever since the Covid pandemic hit, my chance to go out significantly decreased. I only got to go out two times every two weeks. Ever since I got a job and working from home, I wasn’t allowed to go out as it was, according to her, “unnecessary”. I have little to no freedom. The only times that she allows me out of the house now is rare and most of the time it is only when I am going out to exercise. 

She constantly insults my weight and my body my entire life. I’ve grown up with major body dysphoria and insecurities, turning to horrible means to get validation which resulted in some trauma. 

Whenever my AM gets frustrated (which is often), she takes her anger out on me. My AM has a short temper and 0 patience so I’ve essentially become a punching bag. The things she says to me are dehumanising and insulting. My AP got a divorce and lived apart for 2 years before the divorce finalised. Ever since my AF left, things have only gotten worse as she’s now a single mother. She once threatened to kill herself and “it would be all [my] fault” so that I would feel guilty forever. It was traumatic and emotionally scarring, I will never forget it for the rest of my life.

Despite all this, I’ve never once raised my voice at my AM or thrown a tantrum. I have always respected her and kept quiet whenever she yells at me. Yet, she thinks I’m Satan’s spawn. My friends and counsellor all think I’m a great child and are equally at a loss on how to deal with my mother. I’m truly helpless and I don’t know how to go on anymore."

We're learning C# and Javascript with Java coming up next term. We're also studying the methodology and process behind software engineering (which honestly feels like a waste of time to me, I think actual workplace experience would be way better here. It's so boring and dry it's impossible to learn) and working with Oracle/SQL. But we haven't actually made anything yet. We learn about our loops and switch statements, then move on to creating methods/functions and classes, but everything feels so isolated with no bigger picture I can confidently say I have no idea how to actually program anything yet.

Considering most people graduate from a 4+ year program with internships I feel like I'm going to be horribly underprepared trying to get a job coming out of a 2 year program.

On top of that I really have no idea what jobs I'm even going to be able to get in the first place. I really don't want to spend years working for 50k a year (before taxes!!!!!) in Toronto before being able to make more. I'm not particularly passionate about this stuff either (so I don't want to spend all my free time coding outside of work and school), I just chose it because I want to get a high paying job as quickly as possible to I can use the income to fuel things I'm actually passionate about.  I suppose I don't mind the actual programming so I'd rather get a job actually developing applications as I enjoy problem solving but databases are boring, the 400 pages of reading a week is mind numbing, and I hate CSS.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have no idea what I'm doing and have no idea if I'll even be able to get a job as a programmer let alone one that pays well and I really really hate school and do not want to have to take another year or two to further my education enough for the workplace."

Help!!",wandering__knight,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lz3i5y/recently_got_my_dream_job_really_excited_but_also/,"Title says most of it. 

I applied for a job (internship, but doesn’t make this experience any less daunting) and finally got it after searching for close to 6 months. Rejections after rejections, mails getting ignored, I am so happy I got offered a position at this company I prepared so much for during my interview, and I am glad they accepted me within a day!!!! 

The jobscope, role, salary and company culture (from what I detected through my interview at the office), is everything I want! Here comes the problem... as excited as I am, and although I do have some experience in what I am about to do, I am afraid that I am not equipped with the relevant knowledge, skill sets and most importantly work etiquette since this is my first-ever office job. I’ve dreamed for so long, and now I have finally gotten this chance to prove myself, I really don’t want to mess this opportunity up. 

Broke up with my boyfriend recently, estranged from my family for a while, nobody to share this good news with except my friends (most of them are still searching for internships and they are really anxious so I don’t feel like it would be a good idea to ask them about it, it would seem like I am rubbing it into their face but I’m really not). 

I know I can’t expect myself to know it all since Day 1, but I can’t possibly step into the office not knowing anything, especially about social skills and work ethic! How do I mingle with my colleagues, how do I manage my workload, how do I make sure I am not doing the wrong thing? My mentor has also organised a drinking session next, next week (lockdown restrictions are ok here) after the last intern comes on board. What do people do there? How do I present myself so that I don’t come across as weird, inexperienced, blur, but rather someone confident and willing to learn, yet doesn’t come across as desperate to please the bosses? 

I have a lot of questions, sorry about that! I’m just not sure what to do or expect since there’s nobody I can really ask for advice from at the moment. Would be glad to take up any advice! Thank you."
lz3p06,258,2021-03-06,Step Off the EC Hamster Wheel and Find your Star-Shaped Self. It's all about the E-Word -- Extracurriculars.,admissionsmom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/lz3p06/step_off_the_ec_hamster_wheel_and_find_your/,"“How good are my extracurriculars?” is one of the most common questions we get on r/ApplyingToCollege. Then I receive tons more about how many extracurriculars are necessary and whether a kid’s chances will be hurt because they haven’t performed at Carnegie Hall, been speaking Mandarin since they were five years old, or cured cancer. I get it. It’s an important part of your application. It’s also a broad category, and as a result, there’s a lot of room for creativity and individuality. That also means that kids feel a lot of pressure to have the most impressive, superhuman extracurriculars possible.

I mean if you’re at any stage of the college admissions process, you already know the word “extracurriculars” is important. Colleges want you to not just be a great student and an amazing test taker, but also someone who spends their time doing meaningful activities.

JEEZ. As if you didn’t have enough on your plate.

But think about it like this: there are lots of students who have grades and scores similar to yours, but none with the exact combination of interests that make you you. Here’s the good news: activities that are meaningful and important to you can actually improve your life and make you a better person while making you a stronger college applicant. Considering the opportunity that the Activities Section of the application affords you, be proud of your extracurriculars! Despite what you might have heard, you do not need to cure cancer, be a violin prodigy, have thousands of volunteer hours, be president of multiple clubs, or be in a sport to go to college. Those are all good activities, but they aren’t a requirement.

If you help out at your parents’ business or care for a grandparent, include that! Do you work as a cowboy, like a real, working, horse-riding, rounding-up cowboy? Definitely put that down. Are you a professional speedcuber? Let colleges know. Do you like to read a lot? Show them. Do you moderate a subreddit? Do you spend a substantial amount of time running a meme page? Do you spend hours conducting your own Internet research about a topic you love? They want to know that, too.

The bad news? There is no magic formula or combination of “best” extracurricular activities that will guarantee you get admitted to your favorite colleges. If so, everyone would be doing those.

**SO, WHAT** ***DO*** **COLLEGES REALLY WANT?**

Ask yourself: Does it seem interesting to you? Is it something that you can get behind and feel like what you are doing is worthwhile or meaningful to you or others? If so, yes, it can be good for your application. If not, then no. If you’re worried about the amazing specialness of an activity or opportunity, it means you’re really not that into it. The lack of interest is what makes that particular EC nothing special for you, and you’d be better off finding something else. As an admissions counselor from U Chicago shared at an info session, “As soon as you figure out what you think we’re looking for, we’re gonna change our minds.” Colleges want to see the reflection of who you are and what interests you, not what you’re trying to guess that they want you to do.

In a statement made last summer from over 300 College Admissions Deans about what they care about, they said: “We have never had specific expectations for any one⁠ type of extracurricular activity or summer experience and realize that each student’s circumstances allow for different opportunities. We have always considered⁠ work or family responsibilities as valuable ways of spending one’s time, and this is especially true at this time.”⁠ (I summarized the entire statement in an Instagram post linked[ here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCGi7lpBP2-/) and in a blog post linked[ here](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/more-than-300-college-admissions-deans-respond-to-covid-19-my-thoughts/) if you’d like to read the entire document — which you should.)

And, here’s what[ MIT Admissions says about Extracurricular activities](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/)**:**

“Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right — down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you — not what you think is right for us.

Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy — whether it feels right for you.

*College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.***”** (emphasis mine)

Remember it’s not exactly about the type of ECs you do — it’s more about your involvement. If you are enthusiastic, interested, and involved, then any activity is a good EC. They don’t have to be unique. In fact, I’m not so sure there is such a thing as a “unique” activity anymore. If it has added value to your life and helps paint a picture of high school you, include it in your application.

In the end, you gotta realize that extracurriculars are merely one part of your whole application. Do they guarantee admission to any particular school or set of schools? Are they the deciding factor between acceptance and rejection? No and no, because colleges that consider your ECs are looking at your entire application package and also at their own institutional needs, so there’s no guessing what’s going to appeal to any one school for any one year. If anything, learning about your activities provides admissions counselors an opportunity to get to know you better. That means you just have to keep doing you!

So while the following tips aren’t a cheat sheet, I hope they offer some wisdom and guidance that you might find helpful on your college admissions journey.

**THINK OUTSIDE THE EC BOX**

Keep in mind that basically anything that you do outside of classwork, homework, and test prep is considered an activity. That includes jobs, family and home responsibilities, elderly or child care, personal projects, interests, and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to the more typical research, internships, and in and out of school community service, clubs, and sports.

That’s right. ANYTHING. If you worked in a coffee shop, that counts. If you maintain a blog, that counts too. Even playing video games can count in the right context (like if you’re interested in a related field).

Colleges want to see that you have a life beyond school work and test prep. So don’t be afraid to mix it up. Also, keep in mind that colleges understand when you have home and family responsibilities, and these also belong on the Activities list on your application. If you spend your afternoon taking care of your siblings or your grandparents or you have to help your parents in their business, list it. That counts.

**BE STAR-SHAPED**

Look, colleges don’t want you obsessing over the most impressive, superhuman extracurriculars possible. They aren’t looking for you to have any particular kind of ECs. They want to know what gets you interested and involved. High school is a time for you to learn about yourself and what intrigues, interests, and excites you. You’re a teenager; you should be exploring and checking out a variety of interests and experiences.

Don’t box yourself in, thinking that there are only a few things you should be doing. As such — and I acknowledge I’m going against the grain here — my philosophy for helping kids with extracurriculars is all about being star-shaped. I don’t actually recommend having one big “spike,” meaning a single extracurricular you devote all your time to, though I recognize that’s the trendy advice these days, nor do I recommend trying to pursue every single extracurricular you can because you feel like you need to check off a laundry list of activities for the “resume booster club” so you can be “well-rounded.” Instead, shoot for being kinda well-rounded with some spikes — like a star — by pursuing four or five activities that interest and excite you. But honestly, you do you. Be who you are. *That’s what colleges want.* And if being you means having one big spike or being a perfectly round ball, then that’s perfectly fine, too.

**GET INVOLVED**

**Get involved with your life**: Read, read, and read some more. Get a real teenager job. Take care of yourself. Exercise. Walk — a lot. Practice mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. Learn stuff that helps brain development, like an instrument and a language. Take up a hobby like knitting, origami, historical research, or whatever strikes your fancy. Do more than schoolwork, social media, video games, and Netflix binging — not that there’s anything wrong with any of that, there just needs to be a balance. Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.

**Get involved with your family:** Be a leader in your family. Organize game night. Cook dinner for your family. Wash dishes. Babysit your siblings. Help with grandparent care. *A note about family responsibilities:* Some teens have to be at home every day after school to watch siblings while parents work or help with elderly relatives. There’s no way they can participate fully in other extended ECs. Not only do your family responsibilities preclude “normal” ECs, but they also show your dedication, commitment, and responsibility. Colleges want to know about this. Colleges know family obligations take precedence over more conventional extracurriculars. If your family relies on you to care for a relative, let colleges know. You can address this in the Activities section and then explain in more detail in the Additional Info section if you feel it needs to be addressed more fully in order for them to more fully evaluate your application.

**Get involved with your school:** Join a club or two, or start one. Or not. Just do something independently, like make a point to sit with someone new at lunch once a week, especially looking for the kids who are alone. You can figure out what your school needs and what skills and talents you have to contribute.

**Get involved with your community:** There are multitudes of ways to be involved. Even just taking the time to answer questions for your fellow applicants on A2C can be helpful. Here’s a mom reminder: “If you’re ever at a loss with what to do with yourself, do something for somebody else.” Look around your community and figure out what the needs are, then begin to work on one. (Maybe check out[ www.volunteercrowd.com](http://www.volunteercrowd.com/) for some ideas). Here are a few suggestions:

* Help out at a retirement home or homeless shelter. Play games or music. My kids interviewed senior citizens about their lives at our local retirement home and then turned the responses into songs that they performed for the senior citizens a few weeks later. You could also write poems about them or make a story for them to share with their families.
* Make comfort bags for people who don’t currently have housing. In my family, we call these “Judy Bags’’ after my mom, who would always drop off food. Include water, granola bars, handy wipes, and anything else you feel could brighten their day and let them know someone is thinking about them.
* Walk dogs and play with kittens at your local animal shelter.
* Volunteer for an after-school program.
* Make sandwiches at your local food bank.
* Coach a kids’ sports team.
* Tutor for the SAT or ACT.

If you don’t feel called to volunteer, don’t worry about it. Use the time you would have spent volunteering to cultivate the activities that interest you. After all, community service is not about college applications, and it’s also not an absolute requirement for your apps. Do it because it makes others feel good, and it can also bring about some of those warm fuzzies inside you.

**MAKE TIME FOR FUN**

Filling your schedule with back-to-back extracurriculars just to pad your résumé is fun for exactly no one. You only get to be a teenager once. You should enjoy yourself and find activities that make you happy. And then you can figure out how to turn those into an extracurricular activity.

If there’s no club at your school that specializes in what you love, start one. “Club Founder” looks pretty good on an application. Look, you can also only list 10 activities on the Common App. Most students list fewer. So keep that in mind too. Don’t overload yourself needlessly.

If it feels like a waste of time, it probably is. Enjoy yourself and find the activities you enjoy. And that will also be valuable to your life regardless of what school you get into.[ Katie Mattlie from Georgia Tech](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) says “To be competitive, you should choose activities that make you **happy**.”

**WORK IT, BABY**

You’d be surprised at how far a good old-fashioned[ teenage job](https://admissionsmom.college/summer/summertime-vibes/) can go. There aren’t many students who work. And the ones who do often think it doesn’t count as an EC, but it does, and colleges love to see real job experience on your application. It shows you’re responsible and gives you real-world skills that a lot of students entering college just don’t have.

If you feel you’re lacking in your extracurriculars, I think getting a job is your best bet.

From scooping ice cream to chasing kids around at daycare to working unpaid (or paid) at your family’s business, jobs can only strengthen your application. By having a job, you are demonstrating initiative, responsibility, leadership, the ability to work with others, and a willingness to get out of your comfort zone. A job can be anything. You could work at a restaurant, a retail shop, an office, a gym, a bookstore, a public pool, a preschool, a summer camp, or an artisanal vegan cashew cheesery — the possibilities are endless. When filling out your activities list and resumes for applications, be straightforward and honest about what your job entails. Simply say what you do. If you work at a pizza place, include the hours each week you work and your job duties. Do you work at the cash register? Do you deliver pizzas? Do you make the pizzas? How do you interact with customers? Or if you work at a daycare, do you organize activities? Monitor children during playtime? Interact with parents? Facilitate the teachers with their lesson plans? Organize materials? Encourage literacy by reading books? Encourage problem-solving by playing with blocks? Encourage creativity by introducing open-ended art projects? A job might seem like nothing special to you, especially when you go to it all the time, but it’s often much more special than you might assume.

**BE A GOOD PERSON**

Colleges are looking for applicants who care about themselves, others, their school, community and the world around them.[ In his blog, Jeff Schiffman from Tulane](http://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2018/01/this-will-look-great-on-my-application.html) writes, “I love reading recommendation letters about students who treat the cafeteria people with kindness and respect. Or the compassion some students show to kids outside of their friend group. These are the important things you do when you think no one, and no college, is looking.”

**CHANGE IT UP**

What you do in your free time doesn’t have to be what you want to do forever. You’re allowed (and dare I say encouraged) to be interested in different things. That’s healthy. Just because you want to be a doctor doesn’t mean you have to spend *all* of your time doing “doctor” things. If you love hiking, great. Find your passions wherever they are and don’t limit yourself because it doesn’t feel like a storyline cohesive to your goals.

**MORE SUGGESTED ECS — GLOBAL PANDEMIC STYLE**

While there’s certainly some light at the end of this Covid-19 tunnel, you might be wondering what to do while we are still enmeshed in physical distancing and possibly even working and schooling away from home. It’s ok at times to feel like you just have to “get by.” I mean it’s been a tough year, and if you need to play video games, catch up on movies, while away the hours on Twitch, or watch YouTube and TikTok for hours on end, do so, but then but I also encourage you to get out there and interact with your family, friends, school, and community, while taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally.

Eventually, you might even find yourself getting a little bored. Boredom can lead to great discoveries so allow it. And if you start looking for something else to do, I suggest a personal project. ***SUMMER TIP:*** *I always suggest to my juniors that they use the summer before senior year to get a job and work on a personal project so this is an opportunity for you to take the time to learn about and do some of the things that you just don’t have time to do during your busy life.*

**Read, Read, Read:** Reread your favorite books (Percy Jackson calling your name?) Read books you haven’t had a chance to read before (Tess of the D’urbervilles, Rebecca, Fahrenheit 451, Anything by William Faulkner, Ta Nahhisi Coates, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut, Ralph Ellison, Maya Angelo, or Jane Austen, or so many other amazing writers out there. I know my kids loved Robert Jordan when they were your age.) Added bonus: the best way to become a strong writer is to read — a lot. Reading will improve your standardized test scores and help you in every class —  believe it or not.

**Family Time:** *Family History Project* — Collect family stories, photos, and documents to create a scrapbook for your family to keep. *Become a Chef* — Learn to follow recipes and create homemade meals. *Chilling with Chores* — Do dishes and laundry ***without*** your parents asking you. These are the kind of tasks you can do with mindfulness by focusing on the task, or you can stick on some headphones or turn up the speakers and have a big ole Chore Dance Party. *Connecting with The Elderly* — Call and FaceTime with grandparents and the elderly in your life. They will be lonely and disconnected right now and will need you more than ever. We’ve been setting up family video chat times so everyone can catch up and the grandparents don’t have to be so isolated. *Family Game Night* — Bond your family and learn new games or bring out the old favorites

**New Hobbies and Projects:** *Pursue a hobby* you haven’t had time to explore before: Teach yourself Italian or another language that piques your interest, Learn an instrument like guitar and ukulele, Learn about Astronomy, Martial Arts, Gardening, or Chess. This is your chance to explore areas you haven’t given yourself time to explore or you can fine-tune some skills you’ve been working on all along. *Take an Online Class*:[ Ed X](https://www.edx.org/?fbclid=IwAR3t7rzEKkm_IQhQIyzdxRThcXSUMNvz1JVh3e5p_21VpCpJcX_odD_VijQ), YouTube tutorials, MOOCS, Coursera. *Learn Marketable skills:* Learn to code through[ Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree?utm_source=gsem_brand&amp;utm_medium=ads_r&amp;utm_campaign=747168229_c&amp;utm_term=39458666392_sa&amp;utm_keyword=udacity_e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpV80ldk0Xx7SKE3o3tkiWgjODAa9HFjZXgrxPrEtFDozeTYGFF_PVsaAmRJEALw_wcB), Learn Excel — if you can help someone with an Excel Spreadsheet, you will forever be on their good side.

**Get Creative:** Find your artistic side: Draw, Sing, Cartoon, Dance, Paint, Collage, Write plays, Play and Write Music, Stories, or Operas

**Be Outside (Sunshine and Green Bathing are both great ways to stay healthy!)** Wear a mask, sit in the sun, take walks, bike rides, jogs (keep 6 feet spacing between you and others )

**Community Service and Volunteer:** *You will need to talk to your parents about these and remember to keep your health and safety a priority. Some ideas:* Childcare for people who must work, Errands for the Elderly — make grocery store and pharmacy runs for those who shouldn’t be out and about, Help out at food banks for those who are newly unemployed and need back up food, Hand out food or comfort bags, See if animal shelters need assistance

**Get a Job:** Amazon and Grocery Stores are both hiring if your parents and you are comfortable with your being in that setting. Fast food restaurants are still hiring. Or work from home and find someone who can use your schools.

**Journal/Diary:** Write. Write. Write. And write some more. I encourage you to find your voice and practice with it while keeping a record of what’s happening in our world right now. These are truly historic times and your children and grandchildren will treasure your thoughts and reflections about what it was like to experience this event as a teen. Also, bonus — these diaries and journals will help you find your voice and give you reflections and thoughts to turn to when you begin to write those essays.

**Learn:** Learn more about the history of our country and the human rights uprising that’s happening. I have a[ list filled with youtube videos, books, and movies here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trsRyrFX6s9iCLApbIYNWf6tzcm6L8pM/view?usp=sharing) if you’re interested. I’ve also written[ about it (briefly) here](https://medium.com/@admissionsmom/juneteenth-black-lives-matter-and-college-admissions-4ccf98f87959).

**Photos:** Make a photo journal of our changed scenery. As you walk around town, snap up photos of empty spaces, signs posted up, long lines at stores, empty shelves, masks, whatever you see around you. This will be a great way to document for yourself, your family, and others.

And remember it’s ok to just be. Sit still. Think. Chill and relax. These are historical times, and sometimes we need to just be with ourselves to process and understand what’s happening to us and our families and our friends and our schools and our neighbors and our cities and towns. Sometimes we just need to sit and breathe.

**JUST KEEP BEING YOU**

Mostly, remember it’s not exactly about the type of ECs you do — it’s more about your involvement. If you are enthusiastic, interested, and involved, then any activity is a good EC.

In the end, you gotta realize that extracurriculars are merely one part of your whole application. Do they guarantee admission to any particular school or set of schools? Are they the deciding factor between acceptance and rejection? No and no, because colleges that consider your ECs are looking at your entire application package and also at their own institutional needs, so there’s no guessing what’s going to appeal to any one school for any one year. If anything, learning about your activities provides admissions counselors an opportunity to get to know you better. That means you just have to keep doing you!

**STEPPING OFF THE EC HAMSTER WHEEL**

Most of all, enjoy high school! Explore and try stuff and take risks and change your mind if you don’t really like doing something. This is the time for you to learn about yourself and what intrigues, interests, and excites you. Don’t pin yourself into a box, thinking that there are only a few things you should be doing so that you — as a teenager — will become the expert. At the same time, don’t feel like you have to be Captain Every Club or have to join a whole bunch of activities to create a crazy long list for college apps. As frustrating and scary as it might seem to figure out what you want to do outside of school right now, it can also be an amazing opportunity for reflection, self-growth, and learning if approached with the right mindset.

You might have noticed that I don’t use that P-word here in this post. That’s because I think telling 14 and 15-year-olds, and even 17 and 18-year-olds, to “follow their passions” adds unintentional pressure. What if they’re not feeling any passions yet? What if they’re doing stuff that simply interests them? Or if they don’t even know what interests them yet? That’s why I encourage you to explore. Try new stuff. It’s ok to learn what you like and don’t like to do. There’s no shame in starting something and then dropping it when you find something that’s more interesting or exciting to you. Plus, I don’t think colleges are looking so much for that P-word in the way you guys imagine it anyway. They are just looking for authenticity — for you to portray who you genuinely are. Be your authentic self and try to lose the idea of who colleges “want you to be.” You, the real you, are enough.

Tl;dr:

* Think star-shaped for your activities: kinda well-rounded with a few points or spikes for special interests you might have.
* A job counts as an EC, as well as some other stuff you might not normally consider like family obligations, independent research, and hobbies.
* Those Olympians, spelling bee champs, violin prodigies, computer whizzes, and cancer researchers are actually few and far between.
* Figure out what interests you. Try new stuff. Explore. And then dive in when something sparks you.
* Be your authentic self. As Jeff Schiffman from Tulane says, “Do whatcha wanna.”

\*\*Stay tuned for posts in the next couple of weeks about leadership and summer plans! Also, be on the lookout in the summer for a post about filling out the Activities Sections. (All those posts will be much shorter — I promise!)"

I've accepted Bloomberg London SWE Intern offer for this summer, and I am really excited about it!   
Unfortunately, the internship is going to be conducted remotely (but I heard it's still an amazing experience), because of covid19.   
Since I don't live in the UK (I should work from my home country), I wonder if anyone has any experience with virtual internships at Bloomberg (particularly foreigners, since they told me ""we will try to make it happen according to your home country laws and other stuff"").  
Just hoping the internship won't be cancelled!

I need an advice

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent double master's graduate with 4 internships in my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

5 months ago I sent a spontaneous application for a corporate job I really like.

They did not have any open positions but since, according to them, ""I had a stunning CV"" they decided to hire me for a 3-month **unpaid** internship. At the end of the internship, they realized I was a really valuable worker and offered me a 6-month **paid** internship (total would be 3+6=9).

&amp;#x200B;

I am now down 2 months the paid internship (so 5 months total, 3 unpaid, 2 paid) and they basically made me understand I will probably be hired at the end of the internship journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, the fact that my current position is not permanent and ""secured"" really stresses me out. Although the business is growing, they are quite a small office, and I am afraid they could change their plans...not because I am not valuable, but because of shifts in business needs.

&amp;#x200B;

I really like the job and I have the feeling they are exploiting my passion to postpone taking a final decision (i.e. they know I will not quit).

&amp;#x200B;

What plans can I take to secure a full-time offer as soon as possible?  
Should I tell them I have another offer (even though I do not)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

One of my friends was telling me about remote part time internships you can do alongside school during the fall semester (August 2021 - December 2021). I just had some questions that I hope someone with experience in this could answer.

1. As someone who takes around 13-14 credit hours a semester, will it cause burn out pairing an internship alongside this?
2. Will it be useful in bolstering my resume that much? By fall I will already have one internship under my belt, and since I plan to apply to future internships again during the fall, I won't even be finished with that fall internship.

Regardless, I would still like to have practical experience over the fall because I really want to do something with my CS knowledge. However, if the above two points are too detrimental, it could be something to reconsider."

I am currently working as react Js developer (well almost end of my internship) . it's pretty much my first job , took me almost 9 month. during this time i worked with python and worked with Django. but i went back and started from scratch and learned html CSS , js and react js . also i have some experience with react native too and i can build apps with it . i am currently pleased where i am but i am not planning to stay here.

one of my plans is after anew years transition into security and ethical hacking but for now i want to work on becoming full stack developer for better jobs . i have 2 main questions here :

1. i am still learning stuff with react . considering i know basics of programming well and have worked with python ,  is it ok to start things with python  and Django side by side of developing my knowledge of reacts? this python could help me for transitioning in the near future

For context, I’m a senior finishing up my undergrad in May 2021. I’ve been interning at a startup 4 months, and have gotten feedback about not taking enough project ownership because I ask for too much help. I have weekly 1:1s and constantly ask for feedback. I’m learning, but I’m just not learning fast enough to put out work that pleases my managers. 

This is my first internship, and it just gave me a reality check that your co-workers are not your friends. I overheard a director talking about my underperformance, and that I am unprepared; information that was relayed from my manger. 

I would like a full time offer, just for the security of having a job when I graduate. I don’t mind the people I work with, and don’t mind the work itself.

Can I trust my manager to continue to give me honest feedback? How do I go about improving my underperformance when I hit roadblocks, and remind myself that I need to be more independent? Should I try to work harder for the full time offer or should I direct my efforts towards my job search? 

Thanks everyone."

lzc64t,1,2021-03-06,Sophomore Student Looking to Get Into a Congressional Internship Cover Letter Feedback,Italkalot_328,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/lzc64t/sophomore_student_looking_to_get_into_a/," Hello everyone. I'm currently in the process of applying to a congressional internship and was wondering if some of you would be willing to provide any feedback. For context, I'm looking at interning at one of the state offices. Here's my first draft.

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Blah Blah majoring in Education with a concentration in History.

I would like to be considered for a summer congressional internship with Senator Blah's (City Name) office. As you can see from my resume, I have been heavily interested in public service and staying engaged in constituent affairs as a Student Representative at my college campus.

My experience as a student representative will make me a valuable member of the (City Name) senate office’s staff. As a member of the Education Faculty Student Council, I reviewed the concerns of fellow students to find solutions to such concerns. On one occasion a fellow student asked if the faculty library could be made available for students who lacked a stable internet connection. After this encounter, I presented a motion to open campus library services for students who lack internet connection which was approved by the Student Council and later adopted by the Campus administration. Additionally, I headed the Council’s Student Needs and Service Evaluation Committee where student’s concerns are constantly discussed and possible solutions are proposed. This experience corresponds with the type of work that I expect to do for Senator Underwood's constituents.

I have also worked extensively with the public. As a tour guide at the San Juan National Historic site, I was able to interact with park visitors making good use of my bilingual capabilities and knowledge of the park’s rich history. I understand the importance of maintaining a courteous relationship with the public. I am eager to apply these skills to the Senator’s constituents.

It is worth noting that though I am currently not a citizen of the state of (Senator's state), I was born in the state and have deep familial ties to it. As a result, the state and the challenges its citizens face are not completely alien to me. A summer internship in Senator blah's (City Name) office would be an opportunity to build on the experience I have acquired thus far and help me gain more experience in helping constituents so I can more effectively serve the members of my community.

Upon graduating from the University of Blah Blah, I plan to seek a master’s degree in school administration from the University of Blah Blah, Blah Blah Campus.

Sincerely,

Name here"
lzc8ss,2,2021-03-06,24 and Stuck in a rut,gman2878,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/lzc8ss/24_and_stuck_in_a_rut/,"For most of my life, I have been a pretty positive person. Even when things are up and down, I would always stay positive. I used to have a small social life, but was in classes, talked to people, and had a good idea of what I wanted to do in life. But now, I feel hopeless and scared. 

The problem started when I was in community college. I graduated in HS in 2016, and immediately went to my local college to work on improving my grades. I did really well, and had a 3.7 GPA for almost all of my classes. However, I also had pain in my back and legs, and had to do surgery in late 2019. I went to the doctor, had the surgery, and figured there was no way I could go back to community. Of course, I did not want to quit college, so instead I listened to my mother(who never went to college, and applied for a online degree. I was good for a while, began learning to drive(don't have my license yet), and began applying for my first job. I got a job, and assumed my back was better. My doctor said I shouldn't need to see him in 10 years. 

The job I got was warehouse. I figured there would be lifting, but I thought I would be fine. I lasted 3 hours after training. My back was burning from pain, and I voluntarily resigned(I never worked there). At the same time, I was doing well at my online college, and assumed I would be fine. At the same time, I got closer and closer to my now fiancé, and we plan to get married next year. One thing was COVID. I saw how everybody else was paying full price for online, and figured I was making a smart decision, then the paranoia started taking in.

I started looking at my college my mother gave in more detail. I noticed it was not seen as well as other universities, and my degree I want almost requires experience and internships(Information Technology). Since I am online, it is very difficult to find an internship, and my lack of a car makes it even more difficult. Worse, I feel I am on a timer. My fiancé has a writing degree at a private 4-year, and I have seen her planning to graduate in april. I hear about the friends she makes, the teachers, how she was in her honors society for help after work, and how she now has two jobs. Meanwhile we plan to get married next year, and we will temporarily live at my parents for a couple years.

I want to know what I should do. My back pain hurts so much, and I am supposed to get better by the end of the year. I applied for state disability. I received it, though that will not help my fiancé and me. As for college, I feel my online college is unhelpful. I would normally just apply to a local university, as my grades are good, but I never applied for financial aid last year due to receiving extra money from my grandmother's will. I am scared to go back to my community college as I expect they will not give me any aid. My fiancé wants to have children in a few years after we get married, but I have no way to do that. 

I am making some progress. I am talking to a career consular to try to find some type of internship. I am asking my fiancés church for a way to volunteer in IT. I will try to go back to my community and see if I can get aid as well as get more classes done there, as I do not think this online college will transfer properly based on my learning. Thankfully, I have only spent 3 classes there, though that adds up to 6,000. I want to do IT, I love helping people and solving problems with computers, but I hate online teaching, at least in this school. My biggest problem is my back. My mom is retiring, my dad is almost 60 but working, and I feel if I keep disability it would really help them. But, I know I need to help myself as well. I am so stressed, and my stomach hurts from the stress. I need a way out. I just can't find it."

lzeh6h,1,2021-03-06,Should I switch from electrical engineering to computer science?,BananaLeather6179,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/lzeh6h/should_i_switch_from_electrical_engineering_to/,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently in my second semester of first year engineering. I am not in electrical engineering yet (we only start our chosen discipline in the second semester of second year). Lately I have not been enjoying my classes. This is partly due to the fact that I have to take some classes I don't enjoy (like statics and a SolidWorks design course), but also because I am doubting if I am in the right field of study. 

I had a computer programming course last semester, where we learned to program in C, which was probably my favorite course so far. I especially enjoyed the tests, which involved being given a description of a program's output and being tasked to write a program. I even started using Linux during this course since I was so interested in programming and operating systems. I've also had an internship where I did some programming in Python involving data analysis, which I enjoyed too. From the experience that I've had so far, I really enjoy programming (yes, even the times when it takes me 3 hours to figure out the reason my program isn't working is because I forgot a single semicolon!).

I'm not sure if I am going to enjoy future the electrical engineering courses. I used to really like physics (I got a physics award on high school and would often help others with it), but I got a C in physics last semester. Everything just goes so fast, and having 5 other courses doesn't make things any easier. This semester in physics we are starting to discuss electrical fields and electric potential, and I am so lost. I know that I would use a lot more advanced physics in later courses, so I know that those concepts are going to be much harder to grasp. I thought that I would be enjoying learning about this since it's actually something related to electrical engineering, but I'm just not very interested in what I'm learning now. My favorite class in high school was calculus, but now I feel like I'm not learning much. In high school we took the time to not just learn but to really understand the concepts, and now I'm just trying to finish the assignments each week. We also started some basic differential equations, which had me sooo lost, so doing a whole course on this is gonna be tough.

Is it really worth it to go through all these difficult courses? I know I'm going to struggle in future physics/engineering courses. The design projects we've done so far are also something I did not enjoy much, which I know I will have to do much more of later. I still kind of feel like I want to be an engineer, but also feel that I would enjoy computer science more. My university does offer a computer engineering option (which is just a subset of electrical engineering and not its own discipline, so I'd still end up getting a diploma in electrical engineering and take a majority of electrical engineering classes). Anyone have any insight on my situation or have been in a similar situation? Thanks in advance!"

I wanted to know what it's like and what to expect at a job as a beginner. In my 4 years all I have actually learned is programming syntax. I just ""know"" python. I can program a bit in python and a little bit of bash scripting, some network programming. Basically college has taught me a little bit of this and a little bit of that but honestly I have no actual grasp on ""computer science"". Whatever extra stuff I know, I learned on my own from YouTube. 

So my question is, what should I expect once I graduate? I do not know how to code in the industry. If you ask me to create a program on finding different dog breeds and putting them in order and searching through lists, I can do that (basically how CS hw is) but I do not know what types of tasks to expect at a job. Do employers know that most college graduates barely learn industry standard coding? I was going to get an internship over the summer but the pandemic ruined any chance I had. 

Thanks"

I am a computer engineering major and applied to one of their partnering labs ran by a computer engineering department, they had a whole section to the application dedicated to programming knowledge.

I have never had an interview for an internship before, not a single programming job and especially not a research internship. They are an undergraduate research firm that deals with topics like photonics, optics, nanotechnology, nanophotonics, quantum mechanics, ect. And while I have an undergraduate understanding of programming, physics, and circuits, I don’t know much about these topics at the research level.

What type of questions should I be expecting? What’s some advice you wish someone else had told you before going into research? I’m really nervous and I don’t want to ruin it here."

During the job search process I found out some of the salaries for PEY internship at companies in the  toronto/markham area. Like Huawei (70.7k), Intel (68.6 k), AMD (55k) etc.

Are full time salaries for ece grads around there aswell?

I know the pay at the companies I stated above are very reasonable and good for internships but with Cost of living in the toronto area rising, idk if thats enough to live a decent life after graduating.

Should I be looking to try and go to the US after graduating? seems pay is much higher there.

Edit: Just wanna say I am NOT saying ECE/CS/engineering bad to go into. For a 4 year degree, idk much else that can give you very abundant opportunities at cool companies like the ones I listed (and more). Maybe if you go into healthcare (like nursing which I assume is 4 years) you might have better job security, but for just 4 years, engineering is good.

If anything, I am just complaining about cost of living in Toronto and housing prices lol"

They are for non violent property crimes related to my drug addiction, that I've since rebounded from. The first conviction is 2011 and the second is 2014 with a third in 2017. I recently started a bachelors degree in Secure Software Development. I put in more work than the majority of my peers because I KNOW the deck is stacked against me at this point. However, I am passionate for software development and security in general. MY questions are this:

1. Does anyone have any advice for me?
2. Do you think, honestly, that I may be wasting my time?
3. Is there a fighting chance that I will be able to find an internship to complete my degree, much less a job after getting my degree?
4. Can I continue down to a masters program?
5. Should I shoot for a PhD? Is it even possible to get one?

I've gone from being homeless fresh out of prison to a complete 180 degree turn around in my life. Me and my wife have our own apartment and we're pursuing our dreams. The passion and drive is there. *But am I wasting my time?*

Thanks!

**Update:** *I wanted to say thank you to the entire community for all of the encouragement, advice, and information that was contributed. I learned a lot and over the past week I followed up on every lead that was mentioned. So, once again, thank you. I'm hoping that anyone with a similar question or background will see this post and find some inspiration. I know that the child hood fascination I had with all things computers coupled with my love for my family was one of the only things strong enough to pull me from beneath the crushing weight of addiction. This post has also given me a good amount of courage to keep going. Thanks.* "

It pays $23, I was expecting $27-30 as that’s average. My current retail pays $25, has great perks (gym which saves me $50 a month) and is 1/4 of the amount of work this new job will be.

This new job will be much more work (call centre type IT place) and I am wary because staff turnover is high (glass door reviews said so). The only reason I think I should accept it is because my degree is Computer science and this is better on a resume than a retail job. But IT help desk is also not where I want to get into eventually in IT, it would be software development. Whilst it would definitely look better on a resume, it would also not be that useful for a career in software development. 

The commute to new job is 1 hour whilst current job is 5 mins away. 

Any advice? Should I ask for a higher pay? Should I just stick with retail and wait till a proper coding internship comes up? Another similar job I applied to is $35 an hour hence why I’m surprised it’s only $23. This is Australian btw."
lzlqb6,1,2021-03-07,WFH is giving me terrible mental health,ComprehensiveStress5,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/lzlqb6/wfh_is_giving_me_terrible_mental_health/,"Before I complain I just want to acknowledge that I’m privileged for having these problems and I’m sorry to everyone who has lost or been scared of losing anyone during this time. I’m safe and healthy and so are my loved ones even though I can’t see them right now. Although I agree with wfh and covid measures that protect people from exposure, they’re really hard to cope with mentally and I’m at my wits end.

I’m working from home for an internship I was really lucky to land before shit hit the fan last year and then extended because why would I give up a stable income during this time if the offer is right there? I’m also doing courses at the same time which I regret but it’s too late to get my money back. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time and obviously covid made these worse. The #1 motivator for me to get that internship was to force structure on my life because I thought it would be good for me, and I didn’t get that.

WFH has no structure, obviously I could instill it on myself but I haven’t been able to. It wasn’t that bad at first, just regular ol’ imposter syndrome and panicking before meetings but I was only really losing an hour or 2 a day to procrastination. I’ve also been frustrated from the beginning at the lack of guidance. My manager is fine but my “mentor” can go weeks without talking to me if I let them. I just get thrown into things without any sort of prep and I don’t feel like they’ve changed anything about how they teach people remotely. If I were in an office I could just ask people what they’re doing or shadow them but people literally forget about me even when I ask them to let me know when they’re going to do something so I can learn. My boss says that he gets a lot out of me but doesn’t feel like I’m getting a lot out of the experience and I should be more proactive for learning things, which I agree with but I can’t muster up the motivation to try especially after my experiences at the beginning. I'm really scared of coming away from this with ""1.5 years of experience"" on my resume but feeling like I didn't do/learn anything.

My motivation gradually got worse, the fall was ok, I mostly got things done at least, slowly. The last straw was kind of Christmas because before that the gyms were open so I could at least let off some steam there but now they’re closed. I was also able to see my family immediate family but now I don’t know when I’ll see my sister next because she started working for someone who’s high risk and the vaccine situation has been so delayed here. I haven’t seen any of my family since then. I live with roommates and it’s hard being stuck in my room 24/7. I get along with them but they’re distracting and it’s a small house. The other day I could hear one them puking (not covid) all day. Obviously it’s not their fault I wasn’t a dick about it but you just don’t have to deal with that in an office.

Lately I feel like I can barely get an hour or 2 of productivity out of me on any given day and I’m incredibly behind at both school and work and I don’t know what to do. School I can probably cram out some shitty assignments and still pass but I’m still disappointed in myself. Work on the other hand, I feel like I should have been fired by now but somehow I still get good reviews. The last 2 weeks I’ve barely done anything apart from the bare minimum of what’s required of me and I’m struggling to complete that even. My therapist wants me to take a week off but it would be unpaid and if I take it now I’m just going to worry about school the whole time, but I’m scared of how much worse my work could slip if I wait until the term is over in mid April.

I feel like I’m lying to everyone and stealing money but I’m honestly not mentally capable right now of doing more than I am. I don’t feel like I’m fit to work and thought about quitting but I also need the money and don’t qualify for EI unless I’m laid off. I also try to not decide what people think of me for them, if that makes sense. If my boss thinks I’m doing well, then I’m doing well. If he thinks I’m not doing well, he can fire me. Does that make me a terrible person?? I don't want to be fired but I can't afford to quit."

lzn0co,1,2021-03-07,Is it normal to get this much rejection for summer internships?,CharliDelReyJepsen,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/lzn0co/is_it_normal_to_get_this_much_rejection_for/,"I am a master of economics students at a very prestigious school. I don't want to say which, because I don't want anyone to be able to identify me, but it is an Ivy League. I have a 3.5 GPA, and I have applied to about 200 summer internships. I haven't heard back from all of them, but from the ones that I have I only got three interviews, and I got rejected from two of those, and I'm waiting to hear back on the other, but I didn't do very well so I expect I'll be rejected from that too. And I'm not even being picky about the positions I'm applying for anymore. I'm literally applying to anything related to economics, but nothing is working out. Even unpaid internships!!

I have some pretty significant gaps in my resume from after I graduated undergrad in 2016, which is actually due to this same reason. I just didn't seem to be able to get hired anywhere for very long periods of time. That's why I decided to go back to school. I figured going to a prestigious school would be able to make up somewhat for my lousy work experience. I also got a Professional Data Science certification and an AWS certification last summer just in case this program alone wouldn't be enough. 

It just doesn't make sense to me that nothing is working out. I went over my resume with a career services lady a few months ago. She gave me a few pointers on how to improve it, which I did, but she by and large approved of it. I really don't think my cover letters have been bad at all either. I followed all of the career services advice with those too. I don't know anyone who has struggled this much to get an internship, and my program is way more prestigious and advanced than the programs of the people I'm comparing myself to. Is it possible that I've been blacklisted or something? I was fired from one job. It wasn't on bad terms or anything, but my boss there was a bit of a sociopath so who knows? In fact, literally 3 of the 6 people I worked with at that job were also fired. I don't think other companies have access to that information though right?

Idk. I was expecting I would be able to land my dream job as an analyst at a quant fund through this program, and now I'm literally looking into Amazon warehouse jobs. It's not like I'm enjoying my time in this ridiculously challenging program either, so I don't even know if I should continue. I'm taking out a Tesla's worth of loans every semester just to go here. Is it actually normal to face this much rejection for someone in my position?"

How likely/possible would it be to get into the US and work in starbucks? I know that sounds crazy, but the insurance covers some stuff that'll be expensive if I stay over here. Even if insurance didn't cover anything, I would much rather tha *ability* to go into debt to get a problem fixed than be told ""We'll give you an appointment some time in the next few years, just keep waiting.""

I know there are Europeans countries and all that, but I also can't take the cold/lack of sun anymore. I seriously think this affects my mood a lot. Yes, I am taking vitamin D.

I have a PLC qualification in Software Development (1-year course, not sure but might be equivalent to community college?) and am currently nearing the end of the school year for my first year in a science/engineering degree regarding the prototyping/development of new technology. Not sure if any kind of transfer could be done if that would help.  
I'm currently doing a paid internship remotely, that could help me find somewhere if it's on my CV maybe, but starbucks would really be ideal.

I am currently a senior planning on graduating high school in June 2021. During Fall  2020, I had a tragic event that prevented me to apply to more than only four colleges in total.  Two of these are even need-aware so I could apply to only two of the five need-blind colleges. Being able to apply and getting rejected would've been better in my position now, I guess.

I am undecided whether I should go on with one of the top universities in my country which are not very good (in terms of global rankings etc.) or take a gap year. Therefore, your opinions on my profile will be meaningful and they are appreciated. :)

**Demographics &amp; Hooks:** Not white but I had chosen Europe (White) instead of Europe (Middle  Eastern) during apps although I think it doesn't matter since they consider me in the Turkish pool, male, eastern Turkey, competitive private science high school, low(est)-income bracket. I guess I can mention my family getting, literally, torn apart in many ways due to a countrywide political crisis here as well.

**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science/Applied Math

**SAT:** 1540 (I couldn't really study for it due to an intensive program which ended just a few days before the exam. Not even mentioning 2 hours of  sleep, upside down metabolism etc. due to the horrible travel  experience)

**TOEFL:** 102 (Speaking was a disaster...)

**GPA (over 100 and UW):** **9th grade** 99,84 **10th grade** 100 **11th grade**  ≈ 99,84 **12th grade** 100

**Class rank** 7/45 (oh... this might be the worst aspect of my application, the first four have perfect GPAs  lol)

**Coursework:**

Intensive (?) science curriculum (standard National Ministry of Education block schedule for science high schools)

***Extracurriculars &amp; Awards &amp; Jobs***:

Game  Designer at a game project (currently): I've been writing the lore and creating an experience around it. Something great is coming people!

Community  Manager at a Gaming Startup: I was a staff member in a gaming platform  which made games accessible to everyone. It helped me to know people from different cultures around the world and learn how a business runs.

EducationUSA  Competitive College Club and Opportunity Funds Award: I was selected to  EducationUSA’s Competitive College Club in my country. Also, I was  awarded the Opportunity Funds Award which is given to talented international students in need.

International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2020: I was team captain of a nationally high ranked team.

Olympiads in the high school (I've been successful in two different fields as well.)

Cryptology  Summer Camp 2019: Selected among the nationwide applicant pool and got a  thorough education on cryptology provided by The Scientific and  Technological Research Council of Turkey.

Internship at a web design company during the first summer in high school.

Third  Place in American Mathematics Competitions 8 (2014): I was selected to  an olympiad classroom of 11 students when I was ten years old. This is an award I got before my olympiad education in math got interrupted.

Certificate of High Achievement: Awarded after getting certificates of merit for all semesters in 3 years.

Certificate of Honor: Awarded for the outstanding academic performance and exemplary behaviors inside and outside the class.

Certificate of Merit: Awarded for having a GPA higher than 85. Awarded for all semesters in high school so far.

CS50x  Puzzle Day: Awarded after successfully solving 8 out of 8 puzzles in  CS50x Puzzle Day 2020. Also, we were one of the two teams which solved  all of the problems in Turkey. The other team was a team of university  students.

Attended to several MUNs as both committee director and delegate.

Helped  the son of a colleague of my father on mathematics topics since they  don't have access to private tutoring, college preparatory courses, etc.  as well.

We have a social  solidarity club in our school. We organised the gathering of needed aid and brought the aid to disadvantaged village schools. Also, I was in the  volunteer team of a public education center (state-owned). I have  served in various events.

Took part in the Turkish Translation Project of Escape From Tarkov, published by BattleState Games.

Finally,  even though I do not hold any achievements, I had taken archery courses  in a public education center. In addition, I used to play soccer and  basketball a lot with friends at school. My favorite is soccer though!

**Essays:**

CommonApp  Personal Essay (10/10): I believe I reflected the environment I grew up  pretty good and mentioned how drastically a crisis affected my family. Other than the unusual circumstances in my life, I talked about how I  devised my own alternative ways to enjoy life and create intellectual  value when I did not have access to some instruments, resources etc. Also, I mentioned the culture shock I had after a radical environment change and how I adapted to the new cultural atmosphere in correlation with my intellectual growth. 

""Why  Cornell"" Essay (8/10): I made my research and emphasized on the college's opportunities (events etc.) which reflected me and drew my  attention. I had some pretty nice sentences which reflected my  excitement through mixing computer science jargon and Cornell specific words.

*""Why Northwestern"" Essay (7/10):* I made a thorough research and reflected the points which drew my attention and projects I can contribute to in the future etc.

**LORs:**

Mathematics  Teacher (9/10): She has been my class advisor and mathematics teacher  for 4 years. She witnessed the hardships I had in my personal life as  well.

English Teacher (8/10): He's  been teaching English for 4 years. Even though not as much as my  mathematics teacher, he knows about the hardships I had as well.

Startup  Co-founder (6/10): I don't really know what he has written but we did  not have strong personal ties. We've been through a lot of challenging  situations though.

Olympiad Coach  (6/10): This is a letter from the professor who is responsible for leading National Olympiads in my field. To be precise, this letter's  purpose is more like confirming my skillset in the Olympiad field. So,  it doesn't have personal aspects and it is an academic letter. That's  why I kept the score low for this one. (If I take a gap year, I don't  know if I will be able to get this letter again since I left the  Olympiad track to study for National Exams and focus on a game project.)

**Schools:**

MIT

Harvard (no supplemental essay because of the same reason I couldn't apply to more than 4 colleges)

Northwestern

Cornell

Bocconi

Currently, I am waiting for all of their decisions. *Again, I need full-ride and did not get any interviews so far. :(*"

I come from an excellent asian univetsity and have 2 years of experience at a major High Frequency Trading firm in Asia where I have worked on low latency c++ software and FPGAs. 

This clearly got me interested into Systems and Architecture and I am planning on moving to the US for a masters degree. I need suggestions on internship opportunities I should be looking at in this fall for summer next year in the US. Here is some more info:

- I'd really like a position in a research firm. There is lot of work going on at the intersection of systems and ML, and systems and natural sciences - molecular dynamics simulations, computational phy.

- If not a research position, then a SWE internship in hedge funds/hft again will be a good idea. What are some good options?

- Any other cool opportunity is welcome. Any startups in Cal doing some impactful work. 

In short, I want to try an internship different from the regular SWE/FAANG internships.

I wanted some information on such places and opps in the US based on the above."

lzr21c,7,2021-03-07,20 Years no job experience,Powermaple,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lzr21c/20_years_no_job_experience/,"I was born with ADHD into a strict middle eastern family that didn't believe in my ADHD. So I grew up with massive self-esteem issues due to me only getting B's in school, and being ""lazy"". Because I was ""lazy"" I grew up sheltered by helicopter parents who either belittled me for screwing up and tried to stop me from doing jobs in highschool. I never really joined any clubs/extracurricular, and mainly spent my days playing videogames all day to cope/escape from reality. It wasn't until I started college, and moved out that I was able to stop my videogame addiction and regain some confidence.

That was my backstory, now let's move on to my current situation. I'm turning 21 in a few months. I'm currently in my first year of University. I transferred to University after 2 years of college. I have my first Internship term in the summer of 2022, and I have to start job searching/applying for internships in January.

I have:

\- I volunteered at a library a tiny bit. Assisting the staff run programs with kids. Not enough that I feel confident enough to be in charge of a children's summer camp kind of deal.

\- I can program at an intermediate level.  I'm a quick learner at learning new programming concepts and languages. But I've never finished a side project. So I can recognize concepts that I learned, I just can't remember and apply them.

\- I might have more skills may be at a below-average level. I kind of feel below average or useless in every skill that exists.

Basically, what should I try to do this summer to help my self-esteem/confidence/ability to get a job/good internship? Right now my only idea is to try out hackathons this summer."
lzrh64,28,2021-03-07,"Constant anxiety and feeling of toxic competitiveness about job availibility and being ""good enough"" as a 2nd year university student",therottenworld,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lzrh64/constant_anxiety_and_feeling_of_toxic/,"I am in my 3rd year in university but I've basically fucked up 2 semesters now within the span of the last 2 years meaning that I'm behind by about a year now. I'm doing a catch-up semester now following a mobile semester and another catch-up semester before that. Which means I'd be finishing the year with about 2 years worth of european credit points..

Now I think I'm pretty decent at programming, I have front-end framework experience (Angular, React and good control of the 3 basic technologies of the front-end) as well as back-end experience (NodeJS and Spring Framework) and I've passed my algorithms course and can do some decently efficient programming. I also did a mobile development semester and have made a small application as well as working on a React Native application for a real company in a team project and am definitely ready to work on something bigger. Basically I think I am hireable as a junior already, but with university I don't think I can go job seeking for a part-time job and do my university courses at the same time unless either is the sole thing I am focusing on.

The good news is I have an internship upcoming in about 3 months (or well I am supposed to find one, but my university helps with this through an internship market that they organize every semester so I am waiting for that and then I'll have one lined up hopefully). This is required as part of the degree. I think I'll be fine with this as this will absolutely give me a semester of experience that will prove my abilities afterwards for future employers together with my degree when I get it.

But I am basically constantly in this anxious state as if I am in competition with everyone else in trying to prove my abilities. I know a lot of people are better than me at software engineering and cs for sure, but I still feel like there's this constant anxiety about that I don't want new people to enter the field and that I want everyone to bluntly fuck off. I know it's completely irrational. I also constantly feel like I need to prove myself and make things that will impress people or be better than others.

I have several sideprojects I am trying to do purely to satisfy that desperate feeling of being able to prove that I have the ability to be a junior developer or be hired.

I'm studying things daily with the goal of building my foundation in the field so that I can be ahead of others and be more hireable than other people. But the toxic feeling of competitiveness and pressure I feel on myself to perform better than others is really driving me crazy. I feel almost manic about it and also stress over things like the field growing or random ass people being like ""I wanna be a programmer"" because I don't want more competition. I know it's entirely out of my control and a really toxic way to think but it just fucks with my head really hard and gives me stress.

What can I do about this? Do I need therapy? Do I need to calm down? I know my worries aren't unfounded, people are getting more technologically savvy and in turn more people WILL enter cs and programming jobs."
lzrycr,4,2021-03-07,[Portfolio][Scholarships] Unable to decide need help,Distinct_Bite_2239,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lzrycr/portfolioscholarships_unable_to_decide_need_help/,"Hahaha I'm only writing this cause I have exhausted my options and still unable to decide so I was considering between council and CCA exco and all and would like y'all to give your two cents on it as of right now my schedule is quite packed mainly cause of outside enrichment classes at least 4 times a week (planning to drop some if do well for myes) with most of my days ending 10.30 by the time I rch home or either 8+ leaving me with little to no time to do homework.With that said I think it's just my shitty time management skills LOL need the march hols to reset real quick anyways so here's the pros n cons I have laid out 

pros: Council basically there are like shitload of events so it beefs up portfolio+new experience as like planning late events till late nights  and dying together 
cons: Unable to run for cca exco(Chinese orchestra) basically was a exco in sec school and was very lit besides that jc co only has 15 members high chance to get elected (same for council close to everybody in my house has dropped)/not sure about jc workload yet but for now it's okay but I wouldn't want me having too much commitments to ruin my grades wouldn't say I'm particularly smart but think I'm alright just I'm a fucking lazy procrastinating sack of potato

For Chinese orchestra
 pros: event planning is much simpler and I'd say co is my passion and all like I plan to pursue it as CCA in Uni or wtv the equivalent is right now I have close to 10 years of exp
Cons: I'll miss my last chance to plan events in school for council/unable to run council(vice-versa)

A little background on what I plan to pursue I have a rough idea leaning towards biz/law and the scholarship I plan on getting is the nus merit scholarship not to be overambitious or anything they look at ur results and all but I was thinking how's the likelihood I'd get a perfect score or what's worse that multiple perfect scorers having a better portfolio than me besides that scholarship can ease my financial burden and dorm stay seems kinda cool. Coming from a lower tiered jc there aren't really many SIG(student initiated groups) for me to partake in so CCAs and VIA and possibly internship after my A's would count to my portfolio.

As for what I plan on doing right now I would like to take a h3 subject (physics) if I can I do so and all.I know now it's a little to early to count my chicks before they hatch but I believe in setting goals and all so I'll see how when time arrives(mye yye) my portfolio rn includes pre-Uni SEM if that matters

So what's the ideal situation go with my passion in CO just that my portfolio would look rathe stale like being in CO for 12 years after JC or spice things up and go SC with a possibility of me dying from the workload and all. 

In case you couldn't tell I'm kinda bipolar lmao(it's a joke but I have really bad decision making skills like I've alrd dropped out of council once but they added me back because of some fault in their end like I'd regret council and next day perfectly fine with it sharks my mind fucking sucks at making decisions owells)"

you’re worried because you haven’t gotten into your dream reach schools yet. if you don’t get in, what are you going to do? all the time and energy you spent in HS pouring your heart out to get that A in AP Chemistry or putting together those projects for an ec you love... would all go to waste. 

i alrdy commented this on another user’s post but i’ll rewrite it here too. here are stories of my older siblings who went through the college application process full of obstacles.

MY SISTER’s story
Her dream school was Princeton for many reasons. Loved the school in every aspect and believed she was the perfect fit. She had a 4.0, 36, and an impressive array of ecs w excellent relationships with teachers. amazing essays. 

rejected in the early round. she was crushed. in the regular round, she was rejected or waitlisted from four ivies, MIT, Northwestern and more. Only accepted to safeties such as Rutgers. Last decision was Stanford and by then she had lost all hope that she made me check the portal while she was doing something else. She thought, what would happen to all the hard work she put in throughout HS?

WELL SHE GOT IN! it was unbelievable and we all celebrated that night with great cake and ordered tons of merch :) She’s now happily at Stanford!

TLDR: DONT LOSE HOPE AND DONT BE SO ANXIOUS because you really don’t know until the very end. 

now everyone’s story isn’t a fairy tale happily ever. so here’s my BROTHERS STORY:

My brother was also an excellent HS student. Had just as impressive of an application as my sister with ecs academics recs essays- the entire package or whatevah. Yet he gets rejected from ALL reaches/prestigious colleges. Only accepted to Rutgers and other safeties. He commits to Waterloo in Canada w/o scholarship for compsci. Granted, Waterloo is great for compsci but he was disappointed because no “prestige” that comes with T30, and his work was “wasted” because Waterloo acceptances are based just on APs, GPA, ACT, SAT. Parents were pretty hard on him about it. Felt the major tension and just bad vibes even as a 6 year old haha... 

But at Waterloo, he was way ahead of many of his classmates because he had done so many compsci related ecs in HS. Built impressive portfolios and projects to get highly coveted Internships from Google and Facebook. Great connections with his profs. By the time he graduated, he got a job at Google. Now he makes over 200k at 28 years old. Engaged to a gorgeous and super caring gf who is literally the best. He’s out there living his best life.

TLDR- Even if you don’t get into your dream school and end up somewhere you consider to be your “safety” your hard work hasn’t gone to waste. Your hard work will come back and help you to be successful in the future. 

Dad’s story as a bonus section:
My father partied in HS and had a 3.0. Went to the Ohio State University. He did work very hard at his ecs and was an excellent leader and presenter. However, not very impressive as an Asian immigrant child apparently. He worked his ass of networking and working his way up the corporate ladder and is now a senior Managing Director at a top investment company: think JP Morgan or Merrill Lynch... He bosses around grads from UChicago, Harvard, and Wharton.

TLDR- if you have good skills and work hard at your ecs, your life isn’t gonna suck even if you aren’t accepted to your reaches. You still have lots of room to be successful and your hard work may not pay off in the short term, but in the long term of your life, it will. The grind and fight isn’t over yet. Your life is long and an acceptance to a t30 is great but not the end all be all. 

Seniors: if you feel like you don’t have a good chance at getting in anywhere you consider “good” don’t lose hope until you finish opening ALL your decisions. if you get accepted to your reach, congrats! Even if you don’t your hard work has NOT gone to waste and it will work out in the end.

I wish you seniors all the best. Whatever happens know that I am very proud of all of you for enduring this process especially under the pandemic and no senior year festivities. 
Sending virtual hugs and lots of love - a supportive junior and soon to be senior. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk too!"
lzupgr,1,2021-03-07,Advice for leaving a job? Should I leave?,LifeOfMe1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lzupgr/advice_for_leaving_a_job_should_i_leave/,"Hi all.. so I work for a very understaffed non-for-profit. This is my first job in my industry out of college and I’ve been here about 1.5 years now, only being officially full time staff member with benefits and all for about 3 months now... i started as an intern during school... I’m not happy. At all. I am here until about 6:30 pm daily in the off season and during the warmer months very irregular hours, weekends, nights, etc. (think outdoor event industry) up to 50 hours a week. I can’t imagine the thought of working here once the season picks up again. Which is only about a month away. Last summer I had Mondays and Tuesday’s off, sometimes Mondays and Wednesdays and never got to see my friends/family or take part in their weekend activities/gatherings. I never knew what second day i would get off until the week of, which made planning things in my personal life very hard. 

I was the Maid of Honor in a family members wedding and couldn’t even make the bachelorette party.. getting off for important things is difficult.

I definitely accepted the job too quickly. I knew from the start I wouldn’t want to stay here long term but was happy to have something offered to me considering that I graduated college during the start of the pandemic. I feel like I am married to my job now and I don’t know if this control it has over my life is considered “normal”. When I’ve complained about it to others, I’ve had people be like “welcome to adulthood”.. which scares me that any other job I find, I will be just as miserable.

I want to quit but I feel awful about it. There is only one other person that works in my department and the two of us are responsible for keeping the whole department afloat. This other person is currently out on maternity leave and won’t return until well into the busy season. I am doing both of our jobs now, and only making $15 an hour (New York so below standard for my position and not really livable here)... Also, it took me a good 6 months to learn the job adequately. This isn’t something that any person off the street could come into and manage immediately, you need to really know the whole organization. I really worry that if I leave, they will have to cancel all of the upcoming events and would lose about 10% of my organization annual income and we are barley staying afloat as is.. My supervisor over sees 3 departments and would not know how to do my job specifically. No one really trained me, they just threw me in and I had to learn on my own...I really like everyone I work with, which was a major bonus and pull factor for me to work here, I really get a deep pit in my stomach thinking about how bad I would screw them over if I leave.

What do you guys think I should do? How do i do it? 😅"

Hello everyone I'm studying right now mechanical engineering secound year with a gpa of 3.66

i started coding before 4 months where i took a subject called fundemntals of computing and i loved where i started researching more about careers and data science got all of my attention Since math subjects are my highest grades in uni , i enjoy coding (even when it's annoying sometimes) and i already have a small experience in analyzing and cleaning data .

one of the IT professors in my uni suggested to start with learning path coursera  
here's the link to check it out [https://www.coursera.org/learning-paths/data-science?utm\_medium=coursera&amp;utm\_source=blog&amp;utm\_campaign=consumerfall2020](https://www.coursera.org/learning-paths/data-science?utm_medium=coursera&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=consumerfall2020)

i only have few questions which are

1. is it good as a starter
2. would it affect on the long run that i have a mechanical engineering degree and not a cs degree
3. are bootcamps useful ( as in giving you more experience showing you how real life work happens)
4. which are the best places to do internships since in my last year in uni it will be internship

note: thanks to everyone in this group i always read other people's stories and it makes me even more motivated   
another note: i don't know if this is the right place to ask but i also asked in datascience reddit and got to answers."

I need to get something off my chest. I'm a 4th year student, 1 exam left to finish and head full of problems. I need to say at the start that I'm not even on CS or any technical university, I study on the Business Informatics faculty and there I was able to learn some Java that made me interested in programming. On my exams that were programming related I was kinda better than my peers mostly because I love computers and naturally I was kinda interested in the whole logic of coding and making things work when I do it lol. That landed me a 3 month internship in the local company. I was interested in Java, but I really liked Front end development and want to commit going that way. On the first day of job I started learning React with little to none existing knowledge of javascript. One month later I feel like I made no progress and that my mentor thinks I'm stupid. I try to get the basics of everything and understand logic behind everything but I feel like I can't understand how many things work. 3rd week in they gave me a task of doing a whole website for some application with the login, dashboard and privileges for users. For the love of God I can't really understand what should I do and where I'm going without just blatantly copying code from the Internet. I'm about hit my 5th week and I can't understand concepts from 3 or 4 weeks ago. Every day I try to learn new things but sometimes I feel like I'm hitting my head to the wall. As I try to learn new stuff always, I get this feeling of being stupid and that I'll never be able to learn this, it's making me really nervous. Sometimes when I ask my mentor about some simple things that I do not understand, he's like 'I don't really know how you don't understand this' and that shit is killing me, making me feel more and more like I'm a lost cause.
Sorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest.

This all takes place between October 2020 and January 2021

I’m a senior at university and I was contacted by a campus recruiter of Walmart. I said sure, as I needed a job (and you can’t be choosy during a pandemic). She gave me a call and I went through a phone screen where she asked what positions I was interested in, etc. I positioned myself for robotics and signal processing (i.e. sensors), so Supply Chain sounded interesting. She asked for location, I said I was only interested in SF or NYC (I’m from LA and I like the city vibe). I expressed that I am not interested in their Arkansas location. She said sure no problem that’s cool lets do SF, and sets me up with my first round interview.

*First Round Interview (November):*
24 hours before this interview I was supposed to receive a take-home coding assignment which I was to discuss in my interview the next day. The assignment comes… and its front-end. Okay, I don’t know front-end at all but I’m sure I can make this work somehow. I whip up something with Python + Django (and I learned it all on the spot), took me about 5-7ish hours. Created a minimum viable product to show them tomorrow- despite its ugliness. 

I show up at the zoom link at 1pm, and I wait for about 10 minutes before emailing the recruiter that my interviewer did not show up. She sends an apology to me saying that the engineer isn’t answering any emails and we should reschedule. I said fine sure shit happens, but I was a little salty that I spent so much effort away from school for this.

Next week for the rescheduled interview, I get on the zoom link, and no one is there- once again. After about 5 minutes I email the recruiter and &lt;4 minutes after that the dude shows up. He is kind of disoriented, says he was asked super last minute to do this. Okay sure. He asks what my take home assignment was, I explain it to him, and he asks me to show him some features. He likes it, asks me some design questions about it. And then says thanks he has to dip because he has a meeting. I didn’t get any opportunity to interview him.

*Second Round Interview (November)*: Goes smoothly, mostly system design. No complaints. The interviewers liked me, and caught the vibe they were going to extend an offer.

And then I get ghosted… for 6 weeks. I follow up twice with no response. I give up and continue with my other companies. Out of the blue in late December my recruiter texts me saying I got an offer and I should check the portal. Great! I check the portal and there it was. I got offered a low-70s number which was very weird because levels.fyi showed Walmart to pay 6 figures to new grads in SF. My offer letter didn’t mention location either.

I email the recruiter with no response. I get an automated reply saying she was on Winter break and to contact her super who was still in office. I shot her super an email and she scheduled a zoom meeting to talk about the offer in January. Sure. 

*Follow Up.*
I get on the zoom call and she shows up promptly. However its clear she does not want to be here. She gives me one word answers and doesn’t seem interested in talking. That’s okay. I ask about the location, to confirm. And she says “I don’t know, didn’t your recruiter call you?”. I respond no. No she didn’t call me. I was then explained that my location was assigned as Fayetteville Arkansas and that explains the low-70s salary figure. I said I understand but I would like to live in SF and that I cannot accept an offer unless its in California. This got her attention; she explained most of the returning interns took the SF office and that it’ll be hard. I asked her to see what she can do and send me an email if something happens. 

Surprise, I got the location by the end of the week. I politely declined their offer by email (they didn’t respond that email lol) and through their system. I just had too bad of an experience to consider working for them."
lzxqn9,3,2021-03-07,1 year ME-CS vs. 2 year MS-CS for Career Switch to AI/ML,IglooAustralia88,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/lzxqn9/1_year_mecs_vs_2_year_mscs_for_career_switch_to/,"I'm switching careers to CS after 5 years in a totally unrelated field, and I'm wondering what type of Master's program is best suited for my goals.  I spent 3 years after college doing full stack programming at nascent startups (2013-2015), and consider myself a very able developer.  After graduating from the masters program, I'd like to get a SWE job at a top company in New York City, ideally working in AI/ML/NLP.

I have received an admit to a strong (top 10) ME-CS program, and I am waiting to hear back from two MS-CS programs, both of which are great programs but not quite as highly ranked as the school that I was admitted to for the ME.

I've applied for a thousand AI/ML internships for Summer 2021 and gotten immediate rejects from all of them, presumably because I have no recent applicable experience.  For reference my undergrad degree is economics from a HYPSM school, and I've taken 2 semesters of CS classes at NYU since graduating from college.

I guess my main questions are:

1. Is there a difference in the way the ME degree is viewed vs. the MS degree in industry and job search?  
2. Since I have no experience developing on a team, would I benefit from the extended program and having a summer to do an internship before I have to look for full time work?
3. Will I be able to get a job after a one year program without any real development work experience on my resume?

Thanks everyone!"
lzxsqw,0,2021-03-07,HS junior thinking about majoring in CS.,Swanky_Brouhaha29,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lzxsqw/hs_junior_thinking_about_majoring_in_cs/,"As stated in the title, I am a junior in high school. I am homeschooled, 16, and trying to figure out what to do with my life. I started learning Python on edX last fall, auditing a course done by GeorgiaTech, and really enjoyed it. Now I am learning java from the same place. Anyway, programming is something that I have been really interested in and is the first thing that I have really thought that I might want to major in. I have been looking into CS a lot lately and have a few questions.

1. I know that you have to learn a lot of theoretical courses in college for CS majors, Calc 2 at least and courses like it. Past the degree, how often do you guys, in your job, find yourself using things like advanced Calculus? I am taking precalculus through a community college right now. Should I prioritize Calc 1 and maybe 2 for next fall and winter?
2. I have heard that CS is a lot harder in comparison to other types, software engineering for example. How true is this?
3. How much actual programming does CS use? Are you using more math or actual lines of code?
4. I live in upstate New York, right next to the Adirondacks, should I be simply going to a nearby community college for the degree, the by far cheapest option, or should I aim for a higher college where I can get better internships, job fairs, a better college for my resume, etc.? 
5. Finally, I see a lot about internships, how much should I prioritize getting them in college, and what do they actually entail? I am very fresh in the world of jobs, or the world in general since I am homeschooled, so I am not really sure what I would be doing in an internship. 

Thanks for reading my rant and any answers!

Tl;dr: What does it mean to major in CS?"

I switched my major to CS after my first semester so I am a semester behind other sophomores. I had zero prior experience with CS beforehand. I am currently trying to score an internship this summer. I know that I am a good analytical thinker and I have good problem solving skills. With that being said, I can usually complete most projects and coding assignments given to me. However, thats about all I know. What I am trying to say is I know how to code, but I do not understand anything else about to CS world... which really shows in technical interviews. I get so lost when people are throwing words around like Blockchains, databases, the VM etc. I am sufficient when it comes to just being told ""Write a code that does \_\_\_\_"" but thats about it. How do I become more well rounded and able to ""speak like a software developer."" I feel like my university hasn't prepared me for the actual real world as all I have been taught is how to write code and I want to put in the work to make myself a more hirable candidate. Thank you and I am sorry if this doesn't make sense!!!

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I also struggle a lot as well as I am sometimes the only girl in my classes and have found it difficult to make friends in my major."

I’m trying to complete a CS degree while teaching full time.

One of the main reasons I chose my major is that I knew that even if I can't find a hardware job somewhere, I can always fall back on finding a software job. But as I'm looking for internships right now and looking for projects to work on and put on my resume, I've been looking more towards the future and thinking about possible jobs once I graduate. Also looking into possibly double majoring in either EE or CS as I don't think it'd be too difficult to do so within the 4 years as long as I take a class or two over the summer. But only if it would actually help me when looking for a job."
m00sgz,1,2021-03-07,Advice for a 2nd year college student,Hieu_roi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m00sgz/advice_for_a_2nd_year_college_student/,"So, I'm a latecomer to the world of CS. I never had any opportunities to code before college, where I took a programming class and discovered I really like CS and switched my major. Now I'm in my 2nd year of 4 (USA), and I'm learning more about the job field for CS. It seems very different from Mechanical Engineering, my previous major, because in that major the classes are everything, you do some internships, and you get hired. But with CS it seems you have to actively do your own projects and improve your GitHub, Tableau, etc.

I'm looking to go into data science, which means I will probably end up getting a masters in statistics or something similar, but for right now I'm feeling the pressure from the competitiveness of the job market for new hires, and so many of my classmates come from a programming background and know so much more than I do.

My question is this: what advice do you have for me, a 2nd year student whose only experience with programming is from 2 classes (beginner C++ and very beginner Python) to prepare me to be marketable for internships and full employment, even before I get a masters degree?

I understand that data scientists and engineers work mostly with the Python, R, and SQL languages, but what are the best ways to learn them, and is there anything else I should strive to learn on my own? And how do I even begin to build my GitHub portfolio? I don't even know how the site works. Is this even something I should be worrying about now, or should I give it a year until I know more?

Cheers!"
m00zql,5,2021-03-07,Sports for College Admissions,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/m00zql/sports_for_college_admissions/," 

I’ve been playing a competitive sport at a competitive level and I should be making the varsity team for it twice. This is also not the type of sport people do for apps (e.g. golf, tennis, swimming), and our school is ranked pretty highly within the state for it.  
However, the sport also takes up a TON of time. August, September, October, and early November will be gone because there is only enough time for the sport and taking care of my 6 APs. I will also probably get very little playing time my first year, and be decent my senior year (so definitely no scholarships).

I want to get into the best college I can on a STEM (math/cs) major, and for that I need to study for USACO and the like, so my question is: Should I drop the sport, and focus the next two years on furthering those, or continue the sport and give up those months? I also am part of the quizbowl team (nothing too strenuous but definitely a commitment) , will be doing some internship this summer, and need to study for SATs/ACTs and maybe get a head start on some of my classes. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please please please no ""you should do what you want, not for college admissions, etc.."" I've heard that so many times by now and am sick of it, even if it's this godly saying that will change my advice."

I'm a Canadian citizen and I've had internships in the US for both 2019 and 2020 (both in California only). When I filed my 2019 US federal return, I took an itemized deduction that involved subtracting the amount of California state tax that I paid in 2019, to obtain my federal taxable income.

A few weeks ago, I received form 1099-G which includes the state refund amount that I received for the 2019 tax year. When I filed my US taxes for the 2020 tax year, I used Sprintax, which included the 1099-G state refund amount as taxable income for my federal taxes, but not for my state taxes. This part makes sense to me - however, I'm not sure whether I should be including the 2019 1099-G state refund amount as income on my 2020 Canadian tax returns, and whether this state refund is considered taxable from the CRA's perspective.

Would appreciate any input from those that have gone through the same situation!"

I have two great post-MBA career choices (which I am very thankful for), but wanted to get everyone's opinion as they are very different. I worked in corp finance at a F500 prior to b-school, receiving sponsorship for a fully-funded MBA. Currently at an M7 program. I really enjoyed working for my firm prior to b-school. Great people, a great mission, and a robust financial leadership development program. Nonetheless, I wanted to go into my MBA experience with an open mind and decided to recruit for consulting. I ended up getting both a summer and full-time offer at MBB (accepted the summer offer, and have time to decide on the full-time offer). I obviously need to intern and see how the experience is this summer, but I've been struggling as I think through the future decision that I'm going to have to make.

There is a good chance that I want to stay in my former industry in the long-run, which makes me think that leaving my sponsoring employer doesn't make much sense, simply because I am at one of the top firms in my industry and already on their ""fast-track"". However, I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to the industry long-term at this point in time, even though I have thoroughly enjoyed it.

I'm trying to balance between personal development, work-life balance, comp and financials, future opportunities, etc. Curious what everyone's thoughts are! I normally play the role of Mr. Miyagi, but now I'm Daniel-san, needing some advice! Some further information below.

F500 Full Sponsorship Route:

* School tuition fully covered, plus grossed up for taxes (owe firm 3 years post-MBA)
* Post MBA: \~160k total comp + \~50k signing bonus
* Promotion to Director in \~2 years (15% comp increase)
* Promo track: normally director for \~5 years (2 Director roles) before promoted into Sr. Director
* Solid people development

MBB Route:

* Would have to pay full tuition back to sponsoring employer, plus grossed up for taxes (\~220k)
* Post MBA: \~200k total comp + \~30k signing bonus
* Quick promotions and significant comp increases vs. being in industry
* Opens up opportunities outside of corp finance function and my prior industry
* Best of best people development

Cheers to the other Mr. Miyagi's out there!"

Other various service projects

I helped my mother with her math tutoring buisness if that counts. I'm thinking of writing my essay about it (since its really important to me and the reason why we came to America) and it has taken up a lot of my after school time from 3rd grade to 10th grade (when it closed)

Honor societies (Mu Alpha Theta, SNHS, Tri M, NHS (hopefully))

I help my mom with some neuroscience research she's doing but idk if it counts cause it hasn't really taken off yet (and also its hers not mine)

I did tennis in 9th grade at school and over the summer in 10th but I still suck and I have nothing to show for it so its probably not going on the app lol

Learned R and Python but no certification (yet)

\- I am really interested in some summer health related programs (the JHU Global health leadership confrence, CDC Museum Disease Detective Camp, an Emory Pre-college program). I've already applied for the JHU one but I have yet to apply for the CDC one and the Emory one. Idk how prestegious each one is but they all look super cool and I would be so excited to attend any one of them

\- I want to try and get an internship at a hospital that my dad works for but idk if that would count or look impressive since my dad works for the company. It will still be a good experience though!

\- I want to start SOMETHING at my school but idk what to start. I was thinking of a club preparing for the USABO (cuz in our school we just show up for it lmao), a research club (but idk if many people would be interested or how exactly it would work), or an outside thing that helps students in the urban area (but that seems a litlle preachy lmao. I still would love to help tho). The thing I'm worried about is that since they would start in senior year colleges will think I'm just starting it for college and disregard it (which is partially true but I also want experience being a leader and I do hope these clubs could make an impact) and also there would be no impact of the club until after I've applied for college (which is fine, it just makes the club not stand out on the app)

I know Cal Poly Slo has offered great curriculums and internship oppertunities to me but I don't think It is enough worth than 200K debts. If I decided to go to Denison, the debts would be much less cuz I got 55K FA from there. However I don't think they have great STEM curriculums as much as Cal Poly Slo has.

Not only that, but constant fights between my parents just add on to the stress. Keeping up with classes, worrying about internships, LC, and house responsibilities makes me feel like my head is going to explode. And with campus shut and libraries closed, I have no escape but my room which I can only hide in my room for so long before being disturbed.

I graduated back in May with a BS in ME. Overall my resume looks pretty good. 3.7 GPA, research experience, extracurriculars, leadership experience, you guys get it. 

I started the job hunt back in February of last year. My dream is to go into the aerospace field so I started looking there first for entry-level positions. April rolled around and I never heard anything after maybe 50 applications so I broadened my scope, figuring any entry-level engineering job would probably be a good stepping stone. May graduation comes around, not even an interview offer after 100 applications. I'm starting to feel the heat now that I'm living back at my parents. It's time to make something of my life and all the work I put into getting my degree. June, July, August, 100 more applications and still nothing. I put my focus more towards internships, seeing if maybe I can squeeze in an off-season program that won't be as competitive. September, October, November, December, hundreds more applications, countless LinkedIn messages to alumni in different companies across the US, countless relatives giving me contact info of a friend in the industry that leads to nothing... And now here's January, February, March....

I'm so tired. I spent the four hardest years of my life making sure I was as desirable as possible to a company after a graduated, and now I've spent another year of seemingly fruitless labor trying to find one company to take a chance on me. I'm at nearly 1000 applications with only one interview to show for it (in which the company completely changed the job title and description on me from ""engineer"" to ""technician""). At first I was able to blame COVID but as time goes on that excuse becomes weaker and weaker. It's getting to a point where a company will wonder why I haven't had a proper engineering career yet. To make matters worse, I come from a community where very few of my peers were able to go to college. Every time someone says ""Oh, you're still here?"" or ""Have you found any leads yet?"" it feels like a knife twisting in my ribs. I feel like I've disappointed my family, my friends, and myself.

Please tell me some of you out there are sharing this struggle with me. I feel my hope and will slowly but surely fading. 

All the best"

My boyfriend’s family owns a little restaurant that is actually pretty popular and busy. He had to move away for a job for a little while (like an intern) and asked me to work there. So to clarify, I already had a job and he asked me to take on a second one for a few days a week. 

At first I told him no, I knew a restaurant was way different from a clothing store and just knew I wouldn’t like it. Finally he convinced me and I felt like I was doing this nice thing for him and his family on the weekends. 

It didn’t take more than a few days for me to start feeling really stressed. I started making excuses and not going as often as possible. I’d cry and make a big deal out of it or say I had too much work. He told me to tell him if I didn’t like it honestly, and I did! 

Now I told him I really didn’t want to work there anymore despite how helpful his mom said I was being. She said I took a load of stress off of her (not to me but to her son because we unfortunately don’t speak the same language). 

How do I get rid of my guilt for not being able to handle this? 

I know many people have restaurant jobs and deal with stressful situations (any customer service job but especially food). I just don’t have thick skin and it is really starting to make me mentally unwell. Which I don’t have any mental illnesses but I am very easily overwhelmed and it takes quite the toll on me, physically and emotionally too.

This whole problem also makes me feel less close to my boyfriend who I love so so much. I would never give up on him or us and I know he wouldn’t either. But I just feel like I’m letting him and his family down. I feel like a shitty person and I feel the worst I’ve felt in a really long time in general."

One of the more common advice points I see here is not to learn more than one coding language at once, especially if you're a beginner. I've been slowly getting back into CS50 (as I had signed up a while back but never got around to actually starting the course), while taking my Programming Fundamentals course at the same time. Initially, my plan was to do CS50 and then the Odin Project so that I can have projects to make a portfolio for future internships. However, my programming fundamentals class focuses on C++ and Javascript (eventually in programming fundamentals III), and after taking a look at the uni I want to transfer to, a lot of CS students there have mentioned that the languages that will be used in those classes will differ. Should I just scrap my initial idea and focus on learning C++ or is there a way that I can take on both languages without frying my brain?

Edit: Thank you all for your advice! I'll leave CS50 for now and focus on acing my programming class! My textbook isn't doing it for me so I'll just look at the C++ books that the sub recommends."

While I'm at it, what's the difference between these two majors? I take it that Computer Science and Engineering will be more software oriented and Electrical and Computer Engineeering will be more hardware oriented. But other than that, I have two questions for each CSE and ECE reader.

1. Which residential college are you affiliated with and how does it impact your academic experience and social experience as an CSE/ECE student? 

2. What's the difference between CSE and ECE in terms of internship opportunities as an undergraduate, in terms of landing a job after graduating, and in terms of your socila life as a student?

For non-CSE and non-ECE students, how do you see your CSE and ECE classmates? What are the vibes you get from them?

Thanks!"

I've noticed that Computer Science and Software Engineering are both offered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. I'm curious as to what both of those programs detail. Generally speaking, isn't Computer Science and Software Engineering the same thing?

Also, there's some additional questions I'd like to ask:

1. How's your social life at UCI as a Computer Science/Software Engineering student?
2. When should a student by expected to obtain internship experience in either of those two majors?
3. How's the commute from home if you're local or if you live off campus?
4. What's the one thing about UCI's CS/SE program that you wish people told you about beforehand?

To the non CS/SE people, what are your perceptions of CS/SE people? What vibes do you get from them?

As of now, I am conflicted between:  
1) FPGA Related distributed systems research role at a large semi-con company  
2) Software Engineer Internship at a bank (ASEAN bank)  


For the research role interview, I was expected to showcase all my hardware/systems related project which I was lucky to have after specializing in ""Parallel Computing"" under my CS course. We mostly went through MPI related projects and I was thoroughly interviewed about my thought process and problem solving skills in this related area. 

For the software role at an ASEAN bank, I was given a simple 10minute short coding quiz followed by an online hackathon day (covid things) and I managed to receive an offer just today.   


My CV so far (Total 4 years education)  
y1 - Software dev intern (IT consulting company)  
y2 - Systems Engineer (VoIP solutions company)  


I am positioning for more Infrastructure/Cloud based roles but I do not want to lose the options for SWE should there be a lucrative enough offer when I apply again next year for a full-time first job. The research role seems interesting enough and there will be lots of learnings here. The gripe I have about the research role is that the internship offers no chance for conversion because the research engineer role is a min Ph.D role and I am not sure if anyone really cares about the technicalities when applying for a job next year. I am not keen to pursue further studies after graduating and am more keen on technical/software/systems role after I graduate. The SWE role seems to me like a stable and extension of my software eng skills and perhaps a chance to understand tech in banking as a whole.   


I need some help as to which offer I should accept and I need help from people in tech. I do hope that I can position my CV well enough for better opportunities for my first job."

Last semester I learned C, and will be learning Java starting this April.

I've been trying to spend this spring break working and learning ahead in Java so that I don't fall behind this coming semester. So far I've learned the basics of Java using codeacademy (how things are formatted, how java is different from c, etc).

Last week I was informed by my advisor that I will be learning mostly swing and awt next semester, and now I'm unsure of how to prepare for that. I haven't found many interactive tutorials of swing and while I have made a simple window and buttons etc this past week, it doesn't really feel like I'm learning because a lot of it is pretty straightforward and does what the name says it'll do.

I was wondering if there's any sort of advice that y'all have for beginners like me. Thank you :)

Edit: I figured I'd need to provide how much I know in C. I'm not sure how the curriculum in my school differs from others but we learned most basic things in class and I got a full mark as my final grade. So I know how for loops, ifs, etc works but I don't have experience with real projects, internships or anything like that."

I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate in the UK (Durham University, 1st class masters degree) and have been working for a fairly large, reputable corporation in the North of the UK as a graduate since September, having previously done internships there. I'm starting to realise a career in mechanical engineering isn't particularly competitive (salaries seem to cap out at ~£50k for a senior engineer for many years of experience), and for that reason I'm looking to potentially switch careers, not just because of money but also because I'm finding the job to be quite slow paced and unchallenging.

I'm considering a switch to software engineering. I have some experience of this through my degree (Python, C, MATLAB and my master's project had considerable coding elements) but obviously I won't have as much industry specific knowledge as a computer science or software graduate. 

How realistic is it for me to be applying to competitive software engineering roles (ideally to boost my salary to 50k+, not just a sideways move from where I currently am). From what I can tell the Fintech or FAANG roles in London are the places to be applying but do I have a chance without relevant internships or a CS/software degree?

I'm not sure if the TW really fits, but I want to be sure to give a warning still. 

When I was 14 there was this 18-year old guy, let's call him Jonas, who was sort of like an intern PE-teacher for around 8 weeks or so at my school. He met with my class almost daily since he worked closely with our class mentor/PE-teacher. In my eyes he was an adult and a teacher.  
Back then I was extremely shy. My face would go completely red if pretty much anyone spoke to me, I was very quiet and never felt relaxed talking to anyone but my closest friends. I wasn't someone you would naturally start flirting with because I wouldn't even look you in the eyes.

Now, almost immediately he made me feel special and incredibly uncomfortable and the same time. He was very, very flirty and I felt ""chosen"" and special. Even during school. Somehow we started talking on MSN (good ol' days), and some months after his internship was over we started hanging out. I found my old diary a while back where I had written down some of our convos, and it made me nauseous. I was so clearly too young and naive to understand his flirting, and he was really trying to get with me. Soon enough we ended up having sex at his place. In my country the age of consent is 15, so both my and Jonas view on this kind of thing might differ from some to yours. I was in on it, he didn't force me to do anything. I wanted it. But as an adult knowing how flat chested I was, how incredibly young i looked (and was), how awkward and inexperienced in life i was... it just feels so wrong that he was 18. What the hell did he see in me besides the fact that I was an easy target? At one point he bought me vodka, too. I also remember asking him once ""Isn't this age gap illegal?"" and he laughed it off, saying that he doesn't want to talk about it. He obviously knew it was wrong. Since he was ""just"" 18 (and not a gross old man) it's been hard to know wether to view him as an actual adult dating minors or just a very immature 18-year old. I think what I'm trying to say is that I still don't know if this is grooming or not. And honestly, it doesn't matter. What matters is the next part.

I know he was close friends with another girl from my school- *one year younger*. I don't know what their relationship was, but it's wierd regardless. And it gets worse. He later started officially dating another girl who was also one year younger than me. I know he had sex with her because he told me. So he had an inappropriate relationships with at least three girls at the age of 13/14.

We met up when I was 15 again, and we ended up making out. I knew damn well I didn't want anything else to happen, and I already wasn't comfortable. He kept moving his hand down, and I kept lifting it back up- over and over. He took my pants off slightly even though I said no a hundred times. The whole thing felt very much like he thought we were messing around and that I would eventually give in, but regardless I was saying no and he ignored it. He eventually held me down and I was really scared. I realized I couldn't move. I awkwardly told him ""You're acting like a rapist"" and he laughed. His mom came home unexpectedly and I got up and left as soon as I could. After some thinking I sent him a message telling him it made me uncomfortable, and he apologized profusely. He has since removed his Facebook so I cant find our old conversations.

It's been 10 years and I haven't really been thinking about it much. But he added me on LinkedIn the other day and oh lord... he has studied to be a teacher and is now looking for a job. *I don't know what level of teaching, which is important to note.*

Idk if he's still attracted to teenagers, or if it was because he could relate to us/easily get to us at the time. I feel super anxious about going to the police, maybe I'm overreacting. But it also doesn't feel right to ignore the possibility that he might hurt someone. What should I do? What CAN I do? Can the police even do anything? Am I overreacting? Please share your thoughts.

TL;DR: An 18-year old had an inappropriate relationships with me and other girls when we were 13/14, he has now graduated as a teacher. It's been 10 years. Am i overreacting to be scared that he might hurt someone?"

On average, how often do people fail coding screening tests for intern/junior level positions? How can I improve? 

I thought I preferred coding tests to take home assignments as they are way less time consuming, but I don’t know anymore if I can really become a software developer."

This is my first CS internship and I will have one more summer after this for interning before graduating. I hear those who work at USAA absolutely love it. Though, to keep the focus on this internship experience, let's say I don't plan to work for either of the two companies full time. Furthermore, let's say I'm shooting for an internship the following summer with FAANG, big tech, promising startups, silicon valley, etc.

Setting aside compensation (one is better than the other), what would you choose? Is front-end experience considered less valuable than back-end or embedded systems?"

I post regularly about business ideas and opportunities. I made a previous post like this and you all seemed to like it. You can check out more ideas like this [here](http://brainstorms.io/).

### #1: Murder Mystery Walking Tours

#### The Opportunity

This idea is less revolved around a pain point and more of a fun idea. Nonetheless, I still think someone should build it. Here’s the background:

* I recently participated in a city-wide scavenger hunt put on by [Let’s Roam](https://www.letsroam.com/), a company that organizes and manages scavenger hunts across major cities. It was a great way to see parts of the city I usually wouldn’t, get me outside, and a fun activity for my friends and me.
* The other day, I learned about the company [Hunt a Killer](https://www.huntakiller.com/), a murder mystery game delivered through monthly subscription boxes that does multiple millions a year in revenue. Each month you get new clues, puzzles, and story details that progress the game.
* Lastly, the company [Detour](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.detour.detour) (no longer in service) provided walking tours via a mobile app + headphones. After being acquired by Bose, they ended up going nowhere.

#### The Idea

Someone should combine these concepts and create a murder mystery walking tour that takes you around a city collecting clues to unlock new parts of the story. This could all be delivered via a mobile app, a little narration, and some geofencing.

I imagine it being just like Hunt a Killer, but done like a scavenger hunt across the city. You could charge people to unlock new tours, have new DLCs, and even tie in seasonal contracts with local shops and restaurants to maximize the experience.

*Note: I drew inspiration for this idea from the* [*MFM Podcast*](https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/)

#### Current Solutions

* [Story Tourist](https://www.storytourist.com/) \- This seems like a similar solution, but rather than using real places, it’s based on fictional places. It also appears to be operational in Europe but not in the States.

### #2: Airbnb Deal Finder

#### The Pain Points

Have you ever negotiated Airbnb or VRBO prices? I hadn’t either until my friend told me he saves \~20% on every Airbnb he stays at. I learned there are a number of tactics he uses to save on lodging such as:

* Leveraging his profile rating (it’s a 4.8/5)
* Seeking out new renters who are in need to guest reviews
* Finding holes in the listings booking calendar. This indicates cancellations from other bookers.
* Destinations that are on off-season

The problem is doing all this hunting is a manual process that takes up time.

#### The Opportunity

Someone should create a simple chrome extension that analyzes Airbnb listings, highlights properties with the highest chance for giving a discount, and shoots them a message inquiring about a discount.

I think this is a super simple idea that could help save people thousands per year on travel.

*Note: You* ***can*** *get kicked off of Airbnb for being too aggressive with discount inquires. My suggestion is to limit the number of inquires you can make via the platform and focus your features on highlighting potential deals.*

#### Current Solutions

* There are many articles talking about how to save on Airbnb listings, but I couldn’t find a tech solution. However, if you do develop a service around this, be sure to reach back out to all of those articles - they may link to you or give you some free PR.

### #3: Managing Interns as a Service

#### The Pain Points

If you’ve ever been in charge of managing interns, you know it’s a huge pain in the ass. Typically, you spend more time per intern than you do a full-time employee. You need to recruit a cohort/class each year, help them figure out housing (in some cases), train them, and most importantly, keep them busy with meaningful work.

It’s basically like hiring a batch of employees and running a summer camp simultaneously.

#### The Opportunity

There should be a service to help manage internship programs. Here are a few ideas:

1. As mentioned, internship programs can be a bit like summer camp. Having a company help manage that aspect alone could be valuable. They could help organize social events, help interns get set up in a new city, and create experiences that help interns get the most out of the program.
2. An even better idea is to help companies create internship Bootcamps. Lately, we’ve seen a number of Bootcamp-style learning programs emerge and gain tons of traction. What if you could do that same thing within big corporations? This would require you to help a company create a program-based curriculum that teaches interns what they need to be successful within the company.

#### Current Solutions

* [Parker Dewey](https://www.parkerdewey.com/) \- Parker Dewey offers “micro-internships”, short-term project-based internships that last weeks rather than months. It appears they help find and manage interns for micro-internships
* [Internship Bootcamp Example](https://www.codurance.com/careers/become_a_craftsperson_in_training/) \- While this technically isn’t a solution, it’s a great example of what could exist. For this idea, they’d hire you to set up a similar program as the one linked.

m0iuch,1,2021-03-08,I (24f) haven’t left my house since the first week of December. I’m supposed to start work on Monday. I’m terrified and panicking.,karamelxo,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/m0iuch/i_24f_havent_left_my_house_since_the_first_week/,"I’ve been at home for the past 3 and half months. I don’t know how I got here. How I became this person. I thought these things only happened in movies. But here I am, scared to go out, scared to interact with people that are not my mum, dad or bf. 
 
Work for me is an unpaid, 15 month long internship. I have to complete it, it’s mandatory. They don’t care how long I take to complete it, I just have to complete the 15 months. (I’ve still got 12 months left) They make me work ungodly hours, 12 hours a day 6 days a week. I’m constantly running around and on my feet.

I - got sick in December. I got Covid, I recovered pretty quickly - in about 2 weeks, but I didn’t return to work. I kept telling myself. 2 more weeks, 1 more week, just until the end of February, then just u til mid March. My supervisors are intimidating, or I feel that way maybe - I’m always scared that I’m going to mess up at work/ someone is going to speak down to me. The scenarios in my head r endless.

Now my family are pressuring me to return. I don’t know what’s this irrational fear of returning to work. I haven’t been outside, not even to buy groceries in this time. I only ever go out to the small garden outside of my house. 

 This has happened to me once before. When I was 18, in my first year of college. I was in a very abusive relationship. He used to hit me, and cheat on me. I stopped going to classes, I stopped going anywhere for nearly 2 months. I couldn’t sleep at night and I couldn’t wake up in the morning. I’m dealing with the same thing again. 
Since my abusive relationship ended (6years ago) I’ve had anxiety about mundane things, even before December. I would freak out and hyperventilate every day in the car as I went to work. I ended most work days in tears. On Sunday, as soon as it’s 6 pm I would start feel anxious because I have to go outside the next day. 

I have so many issues. My biggest being - my mommy issues, aka my mother and I can not for the life of me get along. I need therapy so bad. But where I live (not USA/not europe) therapy is scarce and it’s really expensive. 

I need any help I can’t get. I just want to go to work, without hyperventilating like I did before. I don’t want to feel scared of everything. I want to get on with my life.

The only person I can share things with is my bf, but I’m tired of burdening him with my same stories again and again. And he’s not like me. He’s a very happy go lucky guy...he doesn’t get what I’m so afraid of. Honestly even I don’t know what I’m so afraid off...I need help."

I'm taking community college CS classes to prepare for a master's in CS, and hopefully net a few internships on the way.

I'm trying to switch careers from a HS chemistry teacher to software engineer (I'm in the US, NYC metro area). I figured that with my summers off as a teacher, I can hopefully get some internship experience to see if I like the day-to-day job as a SWE. I've applied to 100+ internships, but have only heard back from 2 companies (and was not selected unfortunately). I'm not even gunning for exclusively top companies, just any companies with intern positions posted. I have A's in all of my CS courses, dedicate time to personal projects related to my current job to show that I can code and have passion for the work, but no luck so far. I feel like I'm always reading and practicing code nowadays, but I feel frustrated that it hasnt lead to more chances to land an internship. What am I doing wrong? By no means do I think I'm special and deserve an opportunity to fall from the sky, but the path right now is unclear."
m0jkf6,6,2021-03-08,How can I best prepare myself for an interview at IBM?,BeterBann,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/m0jkf6/how_can_i_best_prepare_myself_for_an_interview_at/,"I have a big interview at IBM coming up on the 12th for a position as an Entry Level Associate Application Developer. I'm very excited about the interview and I'm honestly very passionate about programming, but I'm incredibly nervous because I really want this job. I've been a Full Stack intern at my community college for 3 years, mostly developing in Angular, NodeJS, and OracleDB. I already had my first interview with IBM, but that was with an HR representative, and she seemed to really like me, so she moved me on and scheduled my next interviews with IBM. 

I know it's weird, but I actually don't have a college degree despite me being an intern at a community college for 3 years. I did get certified as a programmer analyst from the college. My biggest concern is that since I don't have a bachelor's degree, it might ruin my chances because of implicit bias. I don't know if my anxiety is irrational, but I'd really appreciate some advice on how to best prepare myself for this interview."
m0jqqe,12,2021-03-08,Imposter syndrome at first SWE job,ResortNo2187,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m0jqqe/imposter_syndrome_at_first_swe_job/,"Hi all,

I just started my first SWE job \~3 weeks ago, and I feel completely out of my depth. There's just so many things I don't know and I'm being hit pretty hard by what I thought it would be like vs what it actually is.

I don't know, maybe I'm just dumb. In college, I did pretty well and really enjoyed the curriculum. My school primarily taught Java and Python and just expected you to solve some algorithms or tiny projects. A little bit of theory of computing, assembly, systems too, but everything was limited to a 2 week long project or less. I did have one internship (same company I'm at now, they extended a full time offer), but the internship was also just a summer long project that didn't involve anything I didn't already know.

Now at this job, the team I got hired for does primarily huge fixes on internal issues for a web app they host. Plenty of other companies use the app for their operations, so when a problem comes up it's a pretty big deal. I'm the only SWE I, and everyone else is mostly a level III or higher. There are some scatted II's, but I just feel so lost. I've never made or maintained an app before. I don't know the first thing about .NET (but I've spent almost every day learning and trying to watch so many external resources), but every time I open the code base I panic. I know C#, but there's so much I don't recognize or know in the code.

On one hand, I feel cheated from my degree. There was so much time spent on loops, objects, algorithms, etc, but I feel like none of it applies to the job. Sorry for the word vomit, I just feel like I'm at a loss. I have to set goal's soon internally, and all I can think is 'don't get fired'. It just feels like such a large shift from what I did in college and I feel panicked every time I enter a meeting to resolving the tickets on the jira board, and all I can contribute is that I'm still learning. I tried looking at some of the simpler tickets on my own, but I don't even know where to begin.

Am I really out of my depth? Is this common for other new hires to feel or did I spend my college years focusing on the wrong things? Where do I go from here?"
m0jr8g,1,2021-03-08,"Got a great new job offer, but counter-offered by current boss/firm of 5 years (Finance/Wealth Management Industry)?",jik002,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/m0jr8g/got_a_great_new_job_offer_but_counteroffered_by/,"Hey everyone! I've been a lurker on this subreddit for several years, but figured it was time to ask for advice since I seem to be at a bit of a crossroads in my career.

I am currently a Registered Sales Associate in my mid-20s at a traditional wirehouse/brokerage in a major city (think Merrill/Wells/UBS). I have about 5 years of experience under my belt between my internship and full-time role at the same firm. Current all-in comp is just under $70K/yr between my firm paid base, revenue share with my team, and discretionary bonus. Not allowed to work OT unless cleared through management (which is almost never) since I’m hourly. I started off with this firm as an Intern for a year before securing a full-time role upon completing undergrad. I got licensed with my Series 7 and 66 within the year. There was projected to be a lot of growth on this team, as I was working on a team of four Portfolio Managers and a Senior Assistant, with two of the Managers in question retiring soon and transitioning their clients to the ones who remained. I had a great relationship with everyone. The transition process has taken about two years and counting, with its lumps.  The Senior Assistant abruptly retired, and it was just the two Portfolio Managers and myself looking over all of these new clients , leaving me to take on increased responsibility. At the same time, one of the current I work with Portfolio Managers is aggressively recruiting new clients, and other Portfolio Manager on the team is 72 and getting contemplating retirement soon. Hypothetically, there should be plenty of opportunity. All fine and dandy, right? I wish that was the case. This was hinted at but hasn't come to pass the way I envisioned.

Despite being the jack-of-all trades for my team and a resource in best practices for other Sales Associates/Assistants in the office, including those more Senior than me, my revenue share has not increased. My days are usually 50% administrative or operational tasks/50% trading or helping create investment proposals since we're a small team headcount wise. My Portfolio Managers have said that as our client base, I will grow, and that someone will need to be hired under me to handle most of the admin work so I can receive a title promotion and to have the daily capacity to be more ""involved"" in the business. The problem is, they DO NOT want to pay for this new hire/help, and want the firm to pay for it. Understandable. But, the firm says no; our time has to hit an $X amount of annual revenue before the firm bear the cost of a new hire. My team has been very near this revenue goal in the past, but hasn't crossed it. This tussle between team and firm has been on going for two years. I have tried to add additional value however I can, and even started studying to get insurance licensed but was told it would not help while I am in the my current role, nor would it get me a bump in comp. I have been praised by my team and market management for being one of the best Sales Assistants in the office, for having ambition to do more and for managing the transition of this legacy book of business as it hasn't been easy at all, but this hasn't translated to a promotion or increase in comp due to the desire to run lean.

I wasn't actively looking for a new opportunity, but was reached out to by recruiters from two very prestigious Private Banks in the industry (think Northern/JPMorgan/Goldman Sachs), both looking to expand their capacity. I got both interviews, and one of them turned out to be something. The role wasn’t necessarily something I was looking for, but sounded appealing and challenging in its own way. This role was more Operational from my reading here, but gathered during interviews the it has become more of a hybrid/jack of all trades roles, and depending on the team I'd be supporting, may be more investment/trading oriented in addition to client service. This appeals to me as I still love speaking with clients. Becoming a Hybrid Associate/Portfolio Managed is my ultimate goal. They recently offered me a job as an Associate (skipping the “Analyst” role) based on my years of experience. This came with a large pay bump. Their offer was $90K/yr base, with expectations to work additionally paid OT each week and a yearly bonus. All-in comp would be easily over $100K/yr as a result. After two years in this new role/program, I could move internally and join another team if I am unsatisfied with the work being done in this new role. I was ecstatic and gave my current team the heads-up, but they said they wanted to keep me and counter-offered. They're offering to double my % of revenue share, leaving me at around $80K plus discretionary bonus. They said to keep in mind the goal is to keep growing my revenue share and the client book over the coming years. They supposedly ""meant to make me a larger partner sooner"", and wanted to bring me along slowly as the 72 year old partner contemplates retirement and as they’re in discussions with merging with a larger team/client base. I could also bring in clients of my own and get 50% of the revenue they bring in, and get more involved on the Investment side of the business. BUT, there will be no official title change for me until either someone gets hired under me, or until we compete this supposed mega merger. I am very comfortable with my small team because it feels like family, I love my fellow co-workers, the clients etc. and I do see the opportunity for growth. I am essential to my current team since we're only three people total. However, all these plans are just that, plans with no set date as to when they'll happen (this merger has been on hold since COVID last year, older Portfolio Management’s potential retirement and all). It shouldn't be such a struggle with Management and my immediate bosses to get a raise and title change. Truth be told, if they gave me this raise back in December along with these very general, directional career plans of eventually becoming a junior partner and more involved with the business, that would’ve be enough at that point in time. But not now. Everyone around me in the industry is saying to take the new role, that the brand name of the new company and that $100K/yr at my age will go a long way for my future raises. They think that I was never going to get my raise/counteroffer if I never threatened to leave, no matter how cool I am with my current team.  Keep in mind that the new firm is someone I turned down an internship with in University, so if I reneg on their offer after completing all the paper work etc, there definitely won’t be a 3rd time to get hired from them I think.

If you were in my position, would you go with the unknown? It does scare me a little bit that this new role isn’t exactly what I was looking for, and I do feel a bit of “imposter syndrome” coming in in terms of the clients I’d be dealing with and how much I’d be getting paid, and how different the career path would look. Part of me does feel bad that I would be leaving my team current ""high and dry"" since the firm has not hired anyone under me to help. Needless to say, my current firm runs lean. On the other hand, I have also thought that it's not my fault or my problem that they run so lean, and that they weren't prepared for me to leave, and they should've paid me more from the start.

Any input is appreciated! I know this has been a very long read, but I needed to get this all off my chest. 5 years of frustration and lack of proper communication needs to be let out."

The internship pays very well and I am unsure of the salary of the second option. 

Theoretically, if I was offered the second job, what would you guys do? Should I keep applying to other full time jobs while keeping the internship as a backup? I’m really leaning towards the internship and hoping it’ll be converted to full-time since I have heard numerous success stories."

It is perfect except that it isn't a 2-in-1, but I might be able to look past that.

For a 2-in-1 People have mentioned the **Lenovo Yoga** series but let me know what you guys think about its performance and reliability. I want to get something that will last at least 3 years.

    Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase:

  ~$2600

    Are you open to refurbs/used?

   no

    How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

   form factor &gt; build quality = performance = battery life

I really think a 2-in-1 would help me immensely as a math student but I don't want to sacrifice performance. Being able to have a light laptop with long battery and a good keyboard is very important to me. The X1 Carbon gen 8 seems like the perfect fit but the Yoga series is super tempting (I've also hard good things about the microsoft surface pro).

Again, I usually have 20 tabs open in firefox and am preparing for CS internships so I need a good processor, too.

    How important is weight and thinness to you?

Lightweight and thin is ideal, my laptop now is the Lenovo Legion Y545 (~5.3lbs) and it is way too heavy.

    Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

14in. minimum, prefer 15in.


    Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

I don't want to make any sacrifices for a good keyboard, I type a lot, and fast.

    Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

I've been doing research on laptops for days and can't make a decision. I'm willing to spend a lot on something but at the same time I'm not that savvy with knowing what prices are good or not/finding deals/etc, so any advice with that is appreciated :) thanks!"

I intend to pursue internships  at scientific places, which is different from the kind of place I work  at right now. I know of some internships that are more ""part time"" than a  full time job, or at least they will respect my school schedule more.

Also,  will recruiters look at my resume and be absolutely confused?"

I'm graduating this semester (my 6th) and I've never done an internship and my only side projects are small things using a raspberry pi or Arduino using libraries others wrote. I am worried that I graduated too early without a plan or connections or my own personal idea for a startup. I'm working tutoring kids in computer science and have lots of work experience outside of the field but don't know if I can find a good job even with a 3.0+ GPA because I really only did academic work. What should I do to make myself more attractive and is finishing a degree sub 4 years impressive or just look over-eager and not disciplined?

The thing is, the professor isn't very helpful when teaching or helping students. I've emailed and contacted them but it's like they avoid the question or give a vague answer.  On top of that it's online and I feel like I'm not absorbing the assistance as much as if it were in person. I honestly have no confidence that I'm going to master this language or become fluent in it. I planned on signing up for an internship this summer, but I'm having second thoughts now. I tried doing coding challenges but I barely have time for it because I have other classes. I'm not that creative as when I was a kid, so it's hard coming up with ideas on what to code solely on my own. If I would come up with one, I would get stuck then search it up, but the coding jargon overwhelms me and feel worse than before. I don't know what to do, I'm virtually failing my class and am pushing my self to avoid that, but it only leads to burnouts. 

I'm open to any suggestions.  Also not sure if this is the right subreddit."
m0qubk,1,2021-03-08,How do you motivate yourself while working from home,DBellsR,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m0qubk/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_while_working_from/,"Hey guys, first post around here. I am a 22 years old guy, was diagnosed with ADHD and Tourettes very long ago. I've always struggled with motivation and stress. When I got to college, where you are expected to be organized, to do homeworks every day or at least every 2 days, I struggled a fair bit. I was able to make my way through with the support of my mom and my friends, but my grades were never amazing. I failed a few class but was able to barely pass most of them. Now with covid forcing me to work 100% from home, the struggle for way worse. I can barely listen during classes, being distracted by my phone/computer all class long. I tried to force myself to listen to class using only my phone, which forced me to not do anything else at the same time since multitasking is hard when you're listening to class on your phone only. But i ended up just letting my mind wander around. Then there's the fact that my field of study is software development, so i need to be productive on my computer.
Now, I'm in my final semester, 1 week from internship and i need to work hard to develop my 3 softwares for 3 different classes (all team projects where my individual contribution is a significant part of my grade). But like the whole semester and the one before it, when i sit at my PC, my mind just goes onto everything other than school work. If i close all distraction, I'll Justus emptily stare at my screen for hours.
I take maximum dose of Vivance (60mg) as well as Stratera (60mg) and Sertraline (50mg) for stress and focus, yet i can't focus well. We obviously cannot increase the medication 😅
I've tried Pomodoro, calm music (classical and other calm music), brown/white/pink/gray noises, i just wasn't able to motivate myself to start training/running. At this point i don't know what to do.

If you have suggestions, I'm curious!"
m0rj6v,2,2021-03-08,I'm struggling to take the next step and my brain is holding me back,Bluejay_Weak,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m0rj6v/im_struggling_to_take_the_next_step_and_my_brain/,"Hey everyone, I'm a 21F currently in my junior year of college. My academic journey has been rough, horrible grades in school and got diagnosed with ADHD in 5th grade. Instead of getting me help, my immigrant parents pulled me out of school and home schooled me with no knowledge of what an ADHD kid needs. Basically lost 3 years of school until I begged them to send me back and they finally agreed, except for some reason they faked home school records and got me placed in honors level courses? I ended up failing my classes, moved down levels, and barely graduated. Around age 18, I distanced myself from my family emotionally and began to seek help (proper ADHD diagnosis, therapy) and enrolled in community college. I have my associates degree in computer science (always had the passion for it, but didn't think I was smart enough) and am now at a 4 year college, things are much better. My issue is now I'm at a point where I need to start applying for coding summer internships and I haven't been able to start even though I've wanted to for weeks. I sit down and try but just completely freeze. Has anyone experienced something like this before? I've made success in college and I know what to do with my life, but still am struggling with insecurities from the past. It's like there this mental wall blocking me from even trying to apply places. It feels like a step I'm not ready for. I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate to how I feel and see what they did to get past it. 

TL;DR 

After 18 years of academic struggles and parents who made things worse for me, I am now in college and my brain is physically holding me back from taking the next step, even though I know I've made progress."
m0rsws,2,2021-03-08,Chance me for the few colleges he could apply to and other T10-T20s!! I really need it since I am on the edge of a gap year...,DividedCare,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/m0rsws/chance_me_for_the_few_colleges_he_could_apply_to/,"So just to start off I want to clarify my situation. I am currently a senior planning on graduating high school in June 2021. During Fall   2020, I had a tragic event that prevented me to apply to more than only  four colleges in total. Two of these are even need-aware so I could  apply to only two of the five need-blind colleges. Being able to apply  and getting rejected would've been better in my position now, I guess.

I  am undecided whether I should go on with one of the top universities in my country which are not very good (in terms of global rankings etc.) or take a gap year. Therefore, your opinions on my profile will be meaningful and they are appreciated. :)

**Demographics &amp; Hooks:**  Not white but I had chosen Europe (White) instead of Europe (Middle   Eastern) during apps although I think it doesn't matter since they consider me in the Turkish pool, male, eastern Turkey, competitive  private science high school, low(est)-income bracket. I guess I can  mention my family getting, literally, torn apart in many ways due to a  countrywide political crisis here as well. Also, even though I am not a first-gen formally and did not mention it on my apps, bachelors degrees here are actually pretty easy to get that they became meaningless by the time.

**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science/Applied Math

**SAT:**  1540 (I couldn't really study for it due to an intensive program which ended just a few days before the exam. Not even mentioning 2 hours of sleep, upside down metabolism etc. due to the horrible travel experience)

**TOEFL:** 102 (Speaking was a disaster...)

**GPA (over 100 and UW):** **9th grade** 99,84 **10th grade** 100 **11th grade**  ≈ 99,84 **12th grade** 100

**Class rank** 7/45 (oh... this might be the worst aspect of my application, the first four have perfect GPAs  lol)

**Coursework:**

Intensive (?) science curriculum (standard National Ministry of Education block schedule for science high schools)

***Extracurriculars &amp; Awards &amp; Jobs***:

Game Designer at a game project (currently): I've been writing the lore and  creating an experience around it. Something great is coming people!

Community Manager at a Gaming Startup: I was a staff member in a gaming platform   which made games accessible to everyone. It helped me to know people  from different cultures around the world and learn how a business runs.

EducationUSA Competitive College Club and Opportunity Funds Award: I was selected  to  EducationUSA’s Competitive College Club in my country. Also, I was awarded the Opportunity Funds Award which is given to talented  international students in need.

International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2020: I was team captain of a nationally high ranked team.

Olympiads in the high school (I've been successful in two different fields as well.)

Cryptology   Summer Camp 2019: Selected among the nationwide applicant pool and got  a  thorough education on cryptology provided by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.

Internship at a web design company during the first summer in high school.

Third Place in American Mathematics Competitions 8 (2014): I was selected to an olympiad classroom of 11 students when I was ten years old. This is an award I got before my olympiad education in math got interrupted.

Certificate of High Achievement: Awarded after getting certificates of merit for all semesters in 3 years.

Certificate of Honor: Awarded for the outstanding academic performance and exemplary behaviors inside and outside the class.

Certificate of Merit: Awarded for having a GPA higher than 85. Awarded for all semesters in high school so far.

CS50x   Puzzle Day: Awarded after successfully solving 8 out of 8 puzzles in CS50x Puzzle Day 2020. Also, we were one of the two teams which solved all of the problems in Turkey. The other team was a team of university students.

Attended to several MUNs as both committee director and delegate.

Helped   the son of a colleague of my father on mathematics topics since they don't have access to private tutoring, college preparatory courses, etc. as well.

We have a social solidarity club in our school. We organised the gathering of needed aid and brought the aid to disadvantaged village schools. Also, I was in the volunteer team of a public education center (state-owned). I have served in various events.

Took part in the Turkish Translation Project of Escape From Tarkov, published by BattleState Games.

Finally, even though I do not hold any achievements, I had taken archery  courses in a public education center. In addition, I used to play  soccer and  basketball a lot with friends at school. My favorite is  soccer though!

**Essays:**

CommonApp Personal Essay (10/10): I believe I reflected the environment I grew up pretty good and mentioned how drastically a crisis affected my family. Other than the unusual circumstances in my life, I talked about how I devised my own alternative ways to enjoy life and create intellectual value when I did not have access to some instruments, resources etc. Also, I mentioned the culture shock I had after a radical environment change and how I adapted to the new cultural atmosphere in  correlation with my intellectual growth.

""Why   Cornell"" Essay (8/10): I made my research and emphasized on the  college's opportunities (events etc.) which reflected me and drew my attention. I had some pretty nice sentences which reflected my excitement through mixing computer science jargon and Cornell specific details.

*""Why Northwestern"" Essay (7/10):* I made a thorough research and reflected the points which drew my attention and projects I can contribute to in the future etc.

**LORs:**

Mathematics Teacher (9/10): She has been my class advisor and mathematics teacher   for 4 years. She witnessed the hardships I had in my personal life as well.

English Teacher (8/10): He's been teaching English for 4 years. Even though not as much as my   mathematics teacher, he knows about the hardships I had as well.

Startup   Co-founder (6/10): I don't really know what he has written but we did   not have strong personal ties. We've been through a lot of challenging situations though.

Olympiad Coach (6/10): This is a letter from the professor who is responsible for leading National Olympiads in my field. To be precise, this letter's purpose is more like confirming my skillset in the Olympiad field. So, it doesn't have personal aspects and it is an academic letter. That's why I kept the score low for this one. (If I take a gap year, I don't know if I will be able to get this letter again since I left the Olympiad track to study for National Exams and focus on a game project.)

**Schools:**

MIT

Harvard (I uploaded the supplemental essay on the portal but Idk whether they would count it)

Northwestern

Cornell

Bocconi

Currently, I am waiting for all of these decisions. *Again, I need full-ride and did not get any interviews so far. :(*

Lately, I have been struggling with one ethical issue and I cannot rest until it is settled. My story is like this: I am from a small country in Europe, when I graduated from high school I was in the top 0.01% of the country's top students, the prime minister called to congratulate and everything. I had the chance to participate in many science Olympiads representing my country in the best way I could. Finally I was offered a chance to study abroad in a state university where they didn't provide any scholarship. My family's income wasn't enough to afford my living expenses in another, much more expensive country, so I turned to the government and applied in every scholarship they had. The answer every time that I applied was negative (apparently my raking wasn't good enough which I don't believe to have been true because my ranking was 4th out of 40 something thousand), meanwhile, the children of politicians and bureaucrats are able to receive a scholarship and study all around the world, no matter their ranking. So I decided to suck it up and start a job, and meanwhile continue my studies. My graduation was postponed by 2 years because of my work and the heavy load of my department (Electrical and Computer Science Engineering). I passed through some hard times, however, finally I am graduating this semester. During this time I had to afford everything by myself tuition fees, health insurance, accommodation, living expenses and everything else.

One last issue happened when the pandemic first began. Every other international student from my university was able to return home benefiting from some relief program their government provided (i.e. cheaper flight ticket), my country did the complete opposite, it closed its boarders and wouldn't accept it citizens for an unlimited time period. So here I am, alone in another country, trying to survive.

Now that I am graduating, one of the biggest companies in my country, found my profile in LinkedIn and offered me an internship for 3 months and after that I may start as a junior engineer. The payment will be less than half of what I would make in any company in my current country.

One of my friends suggested that I should go back because quote ""Is your country and you owe it"". I don't feel like going, I feel it would be unfair to myself.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope there is someone who can help me solve this dilemma, I am open to any advice you might have. Thank you in advance."

Now I never really had the right mindset while at Community College and even for a while at UCI regarding my academics, but now that I'm about to graduate and receive my BS in Computer Science I'm looking back and wishing I had applied myself a lot more in my studies ( I had decent grades but I could have tried so much harder), I could have also put myself out there more regarding getting to know my professors and networking, and I could have also attempted internships.

My GPA is currently a 3.3 and I have no research/internship experience as well as no extracurricular activities to show for my time in academia.

I applied for a couple schools recently for a CS MS program but I feel like it would be a long shot to get accepted into any of those programs.

In the event that I dont get accepted into any programs what would my best options be if I would like to pursue a MS in the future? Am I SOL?"

I want to stay in Atlanta since I can stay home with my parents and save up some money. Also, I had my internship at intel and I didn't really like what I was doing (busy work mostly).

I also have an avid interest in cybersecurity. I plan to obtain a CSIP certification and move into a defense company of sorts.

Currently I am a sophomore in CS. I am doing alright, I am not the best student by any stretch of the imagination but I do OK. MY current gpa is a 3.5 (although after this semester I think it will drop to somewhere around a 3.2 heh). I have been interested in offensive security in highschool. I got my oscp my first semester at college. I am in the oswe currently but I have not done the test yet because fitting a 48 hour exam during the semester is impossible. Here's the thing. I hate CS. I like coding but I hate the stress of doing several coding projects in a week. I hate all the mathematical theory I have to go through. My school doesn't offer a cybersecurity degree. The closest school to me that does is very very expensive to the point I would never pay off my debt. I am currently working on a ctf competition, and I do competitions for the school cybersecurity club. I enjoy the club but absolutely hate my classes. I want to have my own research/consulting company in the near future but I want some experience first. I am looking to do security research and pen testing.

I honestly want to drop out. I am miserable all throughout the semester. My question is can I still make a good career even if I drop? I can land good internships even as a sophomore but I am afraid if I drop I would not be able to get anything. I'm not sure what major I would switch to as I tried some more businessy classes and I also hated those. So I think I would also hate something like an IT business degree which my school also offers.

Here is the fifty-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

m11opg,6,2021-03-09,I hate working in pharma,safaripeople123,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/m11opg/i_hate_working_in_pharma/,"Hello everyone,

So I am a 24 year old living in Europe. I finished my master's degree in pharmacy last year. During my first few studying years I did an internship and worked in the warehouse for a rather small pharma company. It was not a full-time job so it was okay getting some extra money while studying. 

During my last year in university I landed a sweet internship spot in a rather big pharma company (well big according to my country's standards). I started my internship in one department where the manager and the team was amazing, they helped me a lot, they communicated non stop with me, although I did not know a lot of things, they educated me and helped me to move forward. Overall, I loved being a part of that team.

However, one day the manager of the department that I did my internship in told me that she can't hire me full time because they do not have an open position and they feel that I might be more suitable working in other department. So the General manager of the company called me and told me that I should work as a product specialist. This was a new position in a new department and after working 9 months in this position I still do not have any other team members, except the general manager. This position consists  of managing key accounts and pricing and reimbursement issues. At first, I really liked it and was very enthusiastic about the sales part, but after a few meetings with HCPs I started to hate it. Sales wise it is going good for me, but I hate communicating with HCPs. Every time that I have to go and meet the HCP I hate it, I want to get over it as soon as I can. The thing that bothers me the most is that the results of my work do not depend purely on me. Currently I am in this company for 1 year and 9 months

During my years at university I was a great student and really liked digging through articles and analyzing them, writing papers, but this type of sales work really bothers me, I do not feel happy at  all, the money and the benefits does not compensate what I feel.  Overall, I feel stuck and not getting better at anything. Hate reading these sales books and participating in the sales technique workshops.  It just feels empty.

TL;DR Working in rather big pharma company for 1 year and 9 months. The work that I do does not make me happy in any way, that is purely because the results does not depend on me and I do not fulfill the best qualities of what I have as an individual. I loved writing and analyzing papers at university and I was good at it.

My question is, should I stay in the job for as long as I can and maybe really try to look at the parts of it that I like? Or should I move to other industry (if at all it is possible)?"

I finished my second in-person interview with NBCNews last week for the Digital Tech position and haven't heard back since. How much longer should I wait to hear back from them? Does anyone have experience with interning with NBC? what was your interview process like? 

P.s. I applied on Jan 22nd, and received a video interview around a month later. Then someone reached out to me 1 week later for an in-person interview. Then like 2hrs after that interview, I was scheduled for another in-person interview with another team. The interview went smoothly like when I asked what kinda interns they are looking for, she literally repeated what I said about myself during the strengths question, so I think I did well for the interview. Now, it's been 7 days since that interview and I've been dying to hear back from them. Should I reach out or does it usually take longer than a week for NBC to give an offer?"

I got into contact with the company through my school's career fair. They mentioned that I would have to obtain a security clearance during the interview process, and I didn't think too much of it at the time. However, after I signed the offer letter, I noticed that it was a TS/SCI with a polygraph test. After doing some digging around reddit and other sites, I learned that previous drug use is one of the things that prevents people from getting these clearances. I have smoked weed 6-7 times in my life all within the last 12 months. I am not a regular user; my roommate just smokes it a lot and he has occasionally offered some to me, and I occasionally accept. It has always been in the privacy of my home (except for the first time which was in China when I was visiting my roommate). I'm extremely concerned that this will prevent my obtaining the clearance and that the offer will be rescinded. Had I any idea that weed usage would have such far-reaching implications for employment, I would have never tried it in the first place.

m15w9i,1,2021-03-09,Due paper,thebaides,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/m15w9i/due_paper/,"Hey there! A lot of the problems on here seem quite dark, so I don't know if my question fits in, but I am in need of advice. Basically, I (18M) made a mistake and I don't know how to deal with its consequences haha.

Let me explain: as part of my technical degree I have to do an internship. My university requires the internship agreement to have the original signature of the company you'll work in (so not a printed/digital one). However, this company is quite far from where I live and study, and we can't really travel easily across France because of Covid. So my university agreed that I could get away with using an internship agreement that was printed with the signature, as long as I asked the company to sign the originals so I could give them to my university.

Long story short: I completed the internship a few months later, but I forgot to ask them to sign the papers (I know, it's my fault). Going back to the place where I usually live, I got reminded of that and just hoped my university wouldn't remember that I still had to give them the papers they wanted to. 

However, today I received a mail from them, asking me to give them the original signed internship agreements.

I see four options :

* I explain my situation honestly. That's an easy option and I don't mind looking like a fool. Having said that, the internship (and the paperwork that comes with it, I suppose) are essential to be allowed to do my second year. As a consequence, I'd rather avoid that option. My grades are good so having to do this year all over again just for this silly mistake would be sad.
* Using tracing paper to copy the printed signature onto the documents. However, if they notice I'll suffer even worse consequences.
* Going back to the place where I did my internship to ask them to sign everything. The problem is that I can't really travel at this point, so I would need a delay and I'm not sure the university is going to allow me that.
* I explain to them that I don't have the signed papers, but I invent a story that's more moving than the truth. Chances are if I tell them that I lost the papers somehow, they're going to be more indulgent and maybe give me a delay. The downside is that I'm not a big fan of dishonesty, and I could find myself unable to lie once I'm in front of them.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: The documents I'm supposed to give back with a signature don't have a signature. What would you do if you were in this position?"

I’ve been working since I was 15.  Eventually, I worked myself up to the lead worker at at the restaurant I worked at in high school. 

I’ve always loved the idea of entrepreneurship but after working for the weekends this semester, I am craving something more meaningful and I am starting to get serious.

As of right now, I would love to get in on the ground floor of a startup. Being thrown into the weeds and absorbing all of the information surrounding me would be the ultimate goal. Right now, my tasks do not provide me with the feeling of accomplishing something meaningful to the company. If you were to hire me, I can guarantee you would not regret it. 

I am a junior in Industrial Engineering. Industrial Engineering is all about looking at problems/processes and dissecting it down into making it work efficiently. Additionally, I am pursuing a computing emphasis. Which means I can code at an intermediate level and I am more than open to working on a technical project. 

In terms of availability, this can be negotiated. My time ends at my current position on May 14th. However, for the right position I could do some work on the side until then. Ideally, this job would provide me with location/time flexibility. I hate being tied down to the 9-5 and I would be more efficient if it were up to me. I have been living in a rural area for awhile and I would love to move to a major city. So, if the location was right I would be open to relocating. 

Anyways, please pm me if you have any questions or would like to see my resume. I would love to hear about all opportunities."

I was not a good GPA student, in fact, my GPA before entering PEY was in low 2's. Not only that, I had a probation. However, somehow I still able to go to IBM in a less ideal position working as technical support that requires SQL. Technical support I would say not that bad if you are OK facing with customers, but to jump to a developer, lots of works had to be done. If you joined IBM, there is  hackathon every year, no matter it is the internship hackathon, or IBM call for code, just try to join both if you can. I ended up creating a rescurer application using Python, SQL, IBM Cloud and Google Home Mini. In the meantime, learn the latest technologies, such as AWS Cloud and so on. I understand how many CS/ECE students wanted a developer position, I can only say that if you truly want to be a developer, brushing up algorithm is necessary, but at the same time, never forget other concepts (Like database, object-oriented programming, or even just basic code changing). After all these hard work, I graduated in June 2020, and I was able to work in Toronto, working as a developer that required C++/Java/C# in a 1000-people company.

Other advice I can give while finding the developer position is please get a friend who has many years of programming experience or spend money to find a professional help you with the interview. I ended up finding a professional doing 8 hours of mock interview. In the meantime, while you modify the code or writing the code on the whiteboard, the interviewers are not expecting you just give answers, they expect you to explain, like how did you come up, and why did you come up with this solution. Getting correct answer is important, but telling the interviewer your thought process and logic is the most importnt. And if you find questions you don't know, you would rather try than saying I don't know."

I currently work in an IT Support role and have been trying to make the career change into software engineering for the past month. Should I focus on career change and getting experience or try to get accepted in the program for Spring 2022? 

More details: 
I am 26 and will be graduating from CSU Global with a BS in CS (3.93 GPA) this summer. I started my career in banking, but made a career change a year and half ago that moved me to a IT Support role. Since I am graduating soon, I have begun applying to software engineering positions, but I haven’t had any luck yet. 

I have always wanted to complete this program. I believe it will give me more confidence since it will be a degree from a more prestigious university. Also, I just love the field of computer science so the course descriptions and reviews make me excited to start the program. However, I am unsure if this is the correct time to join. 

My plan currently is to apply for spring 2022 while spending the time between now and then finishing my degree, focusing on networking, applying to more jobs, and preparing for the program. The question I have is, should I focus on transitioning into a software engineering position before taking on the challenges of the program or apply with the hopes that I will become a better engineer through the program while beefing up my resume? 

I realize this program doesn’t guarantee a job and I am worried that it might make me overqualified for entry level positions. I am not opposed to doing internships while in the program either to gain experience. Ultimately, I want to work at a FAANG type company. Any advice would be appreciated."

Why am I overwhelmed? Well, I am lacking working experience within my field as I have only worked in a real estate firm during my Bachelors (Management) which does not relate to the field of MIS at all. I have tried applying to various internships but due to Covid and a high workload during my semester I unfortunately could not get one.

What kind of job am I pursuing?  I am looking to get into the field of Business Intelligence, I have some basic skills with python, SQL and R and I am taking online classes to get some more insights into the field and teach myself some of the skills required.

So first of all is it unrealistic of me to find a position in that field in Canada with my background? What kind of positions would be suitable with my experience? Are there certifications or other skills that I should focus on? Or should I aim for a MIS field that is easier to get into?

m1bonl,1,2021-03-09,Anybody struggle with coding quickly?,Slommee,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/m1bonl/anybody_struggle_with_coding_quickly/,"Hello, 3rd year CS undergrad here,

I love my major and I've enjoyed my classes so far, but I've recently realized where I've struggled is with timed programming assignments.  I'm the kind of person who likes to take their time, study the problem, and think about solutions for a while before I actually start writing code.  However, for tests and online interviews, I feel like by the time I actually start writing code to solve the problem the timer is already almost out.  

I just took a test in a class where I felt confident in my knowledge and understood the problems, but I just didn't have the time to write out entire classes or multiple methods before we had to turn in the test.  I feel that some of the other students can read a problem and solve it instantly, line by line, without even taking time to plan or strategize.  

In an interview for an internship, I had to take a hackerrank test.  I read through the questions and understood the strategies in solving them, but by the time I took the time to program the answer to the first question the time was already halfway through.  Though I had the knowledge they were testing for, time constraints prevented me from accurately demonstrating that knowledge.

In both cases, I felt that if I'd had unlimited time I could've aced both assessments.  When I'm working on projects or out-of-class assignments, I do much better because I can spend as much time as I want writing and testing out my code.

So, my main question is: why is coding quickly even something that's being tested?  Isn't it better to spend a lot of time writing solid, error-free code instead of throwing together something that barely works because I had a 50 minute time?  Once I start a career, I'll have the 8-hour workday to take as much time as I need to work, so why is time a factor in assessments?"

Sorry for this bit of a rant - not sure what I'm looking for in posting this. Maybe just getting things off my chest.

I got my BS in Statistics 2018. I had no idea what I wanted to do after college so just started applying everywhere and even looking at grad schools in all sorts of programs. I got really lucky and was offered a decent job at a local tech firm as a Software Tester position. Unfortunately (but also fortunately), they never had a software tester before and also gave me no insight into what I was expected to be doing. I did almost only manual testing and at the end of my job got into some automated testing - this is where I learned that I really did like coding!

I learned some really, really basic Selenium Webdriver and also used some Java knowledge I had from college. Other than that, that was it - I had plans to go into a software developer position there but then COVID happened and they let most of the company go. I lost faith in the industry and figured that I would go into what my family always wanted me to go into - teaching. Ah... what a mistake (for me that is). I'm currently teaching through a teaching program and I just am not happy.

I want to go back to doing software development but I only have some experience in Java, really basic Webdriver and although I know there are so many online free classes - I don't want to have to go through with teaching next year. I have been reading up on all the CS job subreddits and forums, looking into bootcamps, even looked into Revature (although that prospect scares me with the negatives I see)...

I want to find something that will give me enough money to pay my bills, have a schedule where I can still learn coding to become a developer, and in which I have the experience but it is so hard. I wouldn't mind an internship since as a teacher I get paid through the summer but most of those seem to want coding experience and/or college students as well. I'm just feeling super overwhelmed and bummed out on top of a job that is literally burning me into the ground each day. It looks like I'm looking for a unicorn in a field of cows at this point, which I should have known going into this it was going to be difficult.

Anyways - thanks for coming to my TED talk and hearing my rant :) If anyone's in the same position or similar, hopefully this post makes you feel less alone in your search. If you have tips, let me hear em of course.

m1ccoh,0,2021-03-09,Is this a good course for learning DS if my plan is to get an internship summer 2022,oogaboogabebeamasid,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/m1ccoh/is_this_a_good_course_for_learning_ds_if_my_plan/,"[https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/)

Im a freshman looking to get a internship next summer. I plan to study over the summer (May-September) and practice for interviews. I already have projects done, so I will dedicate most of my time to interview practice, while working on a project to keep my skills sharp. My goal would be Google STEP or MSFT Explore but ofcourse any internship would be great. 

I was wondering if this course cover the DS's I need to know to do well on an interview. Judging by the length, I can probably finish this course in a week and then start leetcoding and doing mock interviews.

Would you recommend this course or is there another course you would suggest I take. 

Ive gotten other suggestions like MIT opencourseware and [this](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html), but I prefer udemy/coursera courses because they have everything in one place. If I there arent any good courses then what would you suggest out of the two? (if it helps, Im proficient in python and js, ok with C, and familiar with kotlin)

Thanks in advance."

I'm a 1st year Computer Science student in university and I'm super frustrated trying to find work opportunities. I usually study 7-8 hours a day and by the end I'm super tired and have 0 energy left for learning and creating projects for my resume. I study this long because my parents tell me that a good GPA is good for job applications. However, I've noticed that almost all co-op opportunities require side projects for some area (e.g. data science internships require data science projects) and GPA is just one small text-field (doesn't seem super important). In school, I'm not learning super useful stuff and we're mostly just focusing on general things (e.g. data structures, memory models, types of paradigms). I feel like the more I study, the less I have time for side projects and this negatively affects my job chances. But at the same time, I feel terrible about myself when my grades suffer.

What's more is that the entire process of applying to jobs right now feels extremely hopeless. My resume is trash because I've been focusing too much on school and I'm not interested in any of the positions for which I have experience in the technologies used (e.g. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript but I no longer enjoy front-end work). My parents are pressuring me to apply for positions that my resume gives no experience for (e.g. data science or bank work) and it feels completely useless since my application does not match the requirements at all. 

I feel like all my hard work in school has been for nothing and since summer internships are basically closing and I've gotten no offers, I'm not sure what to do."

They seem interested in me because I'm an engineering student with knowledge about the process/industry who can also do some SQL/Python more than I am a SQL/Python wizard who can dip their feet into the industry.

The interview is only 30 minutes long and they didn't explicitly call it a ""technical"" or ""coding"" interview so what do you think I should expect? Any tips for it? Anything really 'extra' I could do to blow them away/make myself stand out?

- Is it a good idea if I wait until my graduation (to finish with my degree with less stress, better focus and thus obtain a good grade) and then begin applying again in the UK? Does anyone have any success/failure stories from this strategy?

I find it unlikely that the problem is my CV since I have received very positive feedback about it from recruiters.

- Also, is it a good idea to get a job at a small company/start-up for a few years to gain more experience until things (hopefully) get a bit better with the ongoing pandemic and return to applying again at more companies?

I am planning on moving over to  Canada (on a working visa) by the end of the year to my longtime  girlfriend and am currently living and studying in Austria.

Why  am I overwhelmed? Well, I am lacking working experience within my field  as I have only worked in a real estate firm during my Bachelors  (Management) which does not relate to the field of MIS at all. I have  tried applying to various internships but due to Covid and a high  workload during my semester I unfortunately could not get one. I am  going to be finished with my Masters by the end of october and am still  trying to find a working student position to get some experience. From  what I have heard it is not so easy as a foreigner + fresh graduate to  find an entry level position in Canada (Calgary) therefore I want to get  some advice on how to enhance my chances.

What  kind of job am I pursuing?  I am looking to get into the field of  Business Intelligence, I have some basic skills with python, SQL and R  and I am taking online classes to get some more insights into the field  and teach myself some of the skills required.

So  first of all is it unrealistic of me to find a position in that field  in Canada with my background? What kind of positions would be suitable  with my experience? Are there certifications or other skills that I  should focus on? Or should I aim for a MIS field that is easier to get  into?

Any advice is highly appreciated, my situation is not ideal but I do want to improve it before I take the next step."

Killed it in the last 2 years despite them being harder. I was totally broke, had severe anxiety, medical issues, and depression in my first 2 years and I could barely study properly. Part of it is my own fault for not being vocal about it, seeking out help, and not getting medical exemptions but I probably wouldn't get them anyways. And honestly, I didn't know GPA mattered so much back then and how permanent it was. I mean I saw my highschool friends completely mess up grade 12 drop out for years and they just got better, come back retake courses and their old grade was erased. They all went to uni and good schools like nothing happened and I assumed that would be the case in university if you messed up too as well. This didn't happen. There were no second chances. 

The only ""second chance""  people get is if they  are ready to spend 30k+ and 3-4 years of lost earnings to go back and correct their GPA. Nobody can realistically afford that.


It's not a place to learn but a place to weed people out based on some shitty metric they make up themselves and refuse to compromise on or reconsider. There isn't a genuine reason for GPA to be permanent. What course you took 1 or 6 years ago has little bearing on your abilities and i feel like there should be an option to erase GPA given you can prove competency now. Hell imagine how much more relaxed you would be taking a test if I told you that this 50% weighted test is not the end all Be all of your life. We can have a make up test just in case you were in a bad position in life today and you can prove to us again that you can do this. Or if you had a comprehensive assignment you can hand in, in lieu or for a portion of your grade for a timed test. If they had these options I honestly feel you would see GPAs around the world sky rocket.


Peoples mindset, lifestyle, life stresses and outlooks change drastically year to year. Someone that's winner today can be a loser tomorrow and vice versa.  However, having  people's worth and grades measured by one time snapshot of how they did in a test in that one specific moment is bullshit. It doesn't prove anything beyond your ability to do well in timed tests in that specific moment of your life. And thats another reason why I believe no timed test should ever cumulatively  be worth more then 30% for the entire course and majority of students would much rather have a project/homework heavy course then an exam heavy course any time of the day. They are anxiety inducing, dont reperesent real life situations or competency and doom people who are simply bad at taking tests, depsite that having no effect on the quality and their ability to work.








I did graduate but at the end of the day, oppurtunities for grad school, further education and success are pretty much closed off for me. On paper I'm some below average student and there isn't any nuance to my grades, why I got them, and i don't think a true representation of my own competency. I completed internships,  jobs and everywhere I went, my GPA never really mattered and I learnt more on the job then I did in school anyways. But for some reason this GPA will be an ultimate indicator for how smart and competent I am and will be an arbitrar of my future.



I'm glad I'm in engineering so it doesn't matter as much but I feel really bad for people whose careers depend on grad school in particular for this. I mean, is your math grade really that critical if your applying to dental school? Is a bad math grade or a momentary anxiety attack during a 50% chemistry exam really gonna determine who is and isn't capable of becoming a dentist? Is it even a valid metric to begin with? What if they were to take that chemistry exam again as mature students, or do that chemistry course in a school where exams in general are weighted less? Suddenly cause they do better they can be doctors now? It makes no sense to me.


In countries like India, kids go straight from high school to doing medicine or dental school and getting medical degrees without having to do 3 years of undergrad before they may or may not have a chance to go into medical school.


Its just these minor nuances that make no sense and grind my gears. The whole system isn't really based on anything realistic and it's just a slog to go through."

**Highschool**

When I was in highschool I always felt overweight, I tried going to the gym but had no idea what I wanted to do and this led me to being very self conscious. I wanted to start over in college, do everything right because my highschool life in general wasn't that great. When i graduated highschool, I was very confused about college, I knew nothing. 

**College**

I remember in my **first year** not having many friends and would always go online searching things like, ""how to make friends in college"", ""I dont know how to talk to people"", ""Im confused about life"" etc.. I spoke to some people but didn't really have my ""clique"". **Second year** I remember searching the same stuff, I would sometimes go and cry in library by myself because I just wanted to hang out with someone, I don't know why I was like this. Its not that I was weird, I know I wasn't, but I had 0 confidence. But I had hope third year it would change, I stayed positive. **Third year** same thing, no one really, just on and off classmates, and I was still searching the same stuff. I also had a lot of trouble getting internships during this time, not because I had no offers or chances to, or a resume, but it was because I was scared, I thought I wasn't good enough, I never took any opportunity given to me. My **final year** now, **senior year**, I finally met some guys I started hanging out with. They loved being around me and I loved being around them, we would be around each other a lot, talk, eat lunch, it was everything I ever wanted. But in the end it was my final year in college, I had to graduate and I had to leave them behind, they were not yet graduating although being of the same age.

Same story as junior year, in my senior year I was not able to get a job. I graduated college, went to my graduation, but I didn't want to because it pretty depressing for me. I knew I had no friends there who were going to be there with me so I didn't want to go, but thankfully those 2 guys I met in my last year showed up for me and for some of their other friends as well. I remember crying myself to sleep the day of my graduating because after 3 long years I finally had friends and now they're suddenly gone. I never enjoyed college, most of it was just bitter and sad.

**Post College**

Now I'm 2 years out of college, I'm still overweight(**I tried to lose weight in college, but had an injury after college and couldn't continue**) I have no job, not many people to talk to, I kind of fell off from those 2 guys, I only talk to 1 of them now and an old highschool friend who I am eternally grateful for. But I am still in that loop of disappointment and regret that I cant get out of it. I had a couple of job opportunities a couple months out of college, but I was and still am feeling ""not ready"" so I didnt take any of them. 

**Ill be honest, I'm not as depressed right now as I was before. I tried a therapist, who I am still going to, but Ill be honest it doesn't really help me. I'm more confused and lost, I don't know what to do, where to start, how to refresh, how to build myself up again, where do I go from here, how do I get out of this loop? I'm trying to accept the loss of my past years, but what now, my days are long and empty and I don't know what to do.**"
m1py8c,1,2021-03-10,What do I need to learn for a software engineering internship?,Pickolzi,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/m1py8c/what_do_i_need_to_learn_for_a_software/,"As the title suggests, I am curious on what I would need to know in order to have a chance at an internship. I am currently enrolled in my highschool's AP comp sci class as a junior but the class is pretty easy for me as I learned Java as my first language along with most of its basics such as syntax, iteration, conditionals, and OOP. However I've been pursing python for the past few months as I needed to for a club competition. (I really enjoy python)

Overall I'm wondering what would I need to learn in hopes of applying beginning my senior year of highschool or so.
If you're able to answer some of these questions, that would definitely help a lot!

•What are your favorite python modules?(I might like them aswell and it'll probably make it more motivating for me to learn)

•What kind of python modules/frameworks should I learn?

•Should I start uploading more projects to my github even if they're really basic?

•How do I start looking for internships?(Currently in CA, USA)

•Should I start learning other languages such as SQL?(I've almost never touched a database aside from really basic Django tutorials).

•I tried to learn data structures but I don't really understand how or when to use them aside from stacks and queues. Do you have any python data structures courses/books?


Any information regarding getting me closer to my goal of becoming a software engineer is useful, despite if you are a fellow beginner/noob programmer, intern, or an amazing software engineer.

Anyways thank you so much for reading my post, I really appreciate it!"

I'm a current Junior in college, and it feels like yesterday that I was in your shoes. I currently go to a T20 school, and just wanted to provide some advice that I wish I had known three years ago. 

During the entire process I would be on this page, looking at people's stats, chance mes, etc trying to compare myself to some sort of ""imaginary"" pool of applicants. At the same time I so focussed on the ranking (US News, WSJ, THE) that I let it get in the way of my final decision. I decided to go to the highest ranked school I got into, overlooking other schools purely because they weren't ranked as high. Four years is a long time, and you really need to want to live where you go. Make sure that the town/city has a good social scene, fun bars, and places to go out -- I know it's COVID but during normal times these are where you will meet the people that will stay with you for life. 

In short, you are still figuring out a lot about yourselves, and you will all have to make really hard decisions in the coming months, but the rankings are irrelevant. There's always the next ""thing"" and after this it will be getting the most glamorous internship, and eventually a job. Chose a place you truly want to live for the next four years and are comfortable calling home, regardless of what others ""rank"" it, and most importantly go where you are going to have fun -- you are going to be working your entire lives so why not make the most of it."

I've been looking on their website to see if they have any open internships and it looks like all the ones available are outside my field or for master's students only.

Do you think that would mean that they aren't doing my internship this summer, or that they're only posting ones for the ones that aren't filled from last summer? How might I go about reaching out to the company to ask if they'd be offering my internship this summer again?

&amp;#x200B;

1. How did you go about searching for your internship? What are the most popular listing sites?
2. Would you consider working for a no-name company with an engineering team of 1?
3. What factors led you to choose the company you interned at?
4. Was your internship in your primary programming language? if not how did you adjust?
5. What did you get paid?
6. What kind of work did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that working at a small, or in my case tiny company is actually a great opportunity for a new software engineer, having worked at a variety of different sized companies I personally improved far more quickly while working at smaller ones, by wearing multiple hats (front-end, back-end, dev-ops) and figuring out more stuff on my own rather than contributing to already built systems. 

Going in I assumed that I would learn a lot from working with great engineers at larger companies, how to structure large projects and write production code. This did not prove to be the case for me as the larger companies tended to involve working on messy legacy code and the smaller ones were new and exciting stuff. That being said, I never working anywhere with cutting edge programming and would love to see how Google etc do things. 

Anyway, let me know your thoughts if you have time!"

I used to be a person who used to feel for and understand problems and pain that people felt. Even through med school I was still the same, conversing with the patients, understanding where they came from and doing my best to alleviate their pain and suffering. My colleagues always appreciated the way I could connect with people.

Things started changing when I entered internship, the long hours (sometimes the shift used to last more than 24hrs), the patient load, and the mental issues that I developed due to stress. We were the frontline workers during the Covid pandemic.

Because of the stress and my mental health, I started thinking more about myself.

 The compassion and empathy which was natural to me started fading off and I feel I've lost it to a major extent. I would really appreciate if I could improve this aspect of my personality, not only for myself but also for the profession that I'm in.

I am a Senior studying Information Technology at my current university. The IT we learn is primarily the Governance/Management side of things, so I have little to no experience with developmental knowledge. After some research, I think I would prefer a career being a ""full stack"" developer as I enjoy a lot of the front end side of things, but am also willing to figure out how the back end works. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently under my belt, I know some foundational knowledge of HTML/CSS, and a teeny bit of JS. This is from the ""personal learning"" side of things. From school, I participated in classes that taught foundational SQL work, as well as have some Cybersecurity knowledge from a previous internship. 

I noticed that being a full-stack dev requires all of these things mentioned - front end, backend, knowledge of databases and such.... so I think fullstack is definitely something I want to consider. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am asking for some general input from the community, if this is something that is wise to take up. By ""take up"", I mean spending the time \*now\* and grind the road of becoming a full stack dev, so by graduation (End of summer) I can be somewhat fit for a potential entry level position.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I moved from the US to another country after 8th grade when my mother passed away. I absolutely hate this country, life's been nothing but heck for me ever since I got here and just I'm so done with everything. Here's the story:

I did decently in 9th and 10th grade given the circumstances, but not this year. All the bad things from my past are catching up to me due to this year being online. My mother's loss was more pronounced and I didn't have that busy lifestyle like in 9th and 10th to distract me from it. I completely lost interest in everything. Slept through most of my classes, did horrible on most tests and midterms, did nothing productive at all. My father and most of my family kept yelling at me to study but no matter how hard I tried, nothing stayed in my head. He then put me in this coaching center (cram school), which is very very popular here and many people go to it. They give us an insane amount of work I never really learned how to balance it since I dont get the education system here. I did okay at first, but then it got overwhelming quickly. :/

Then comes December. I had about 2 months to get ready for finals (the only grades that really count here) and I'm doing pretty well. I've made up most of my school work and even got a lot of my coaching center stuff done. But then ""LiFE ThrEw AnoTHeR CurvEbaLl"". My aunt passed away at the end of December. She was the only mother figure I had and I fell into a passive and depressive state for the next 2 months. I lost all ambition and all the work I made in December to make up for the entire was wasted. It was like I never did anything. I did horribly on my prep exams last month and now im in my finals which aren't going very well. I've lost all my motivation. Nothing excites me anymore, not even college. And that terrifies me. This brings me to the last part of my rant which is far more relevant to this sub.

College

Its the one thing that kept me going throughout 9th and 10th grade. I knew that if I did well in them, I could get into a good college and finally leave this stupid country. But now, after reading everyone's stats and ecs, I just don't know how on earth I am ever going to get into one. I don't show much academic rigor from my okayish test scores. The only ecs I have are sports(informal), art, tutoring kids, and one club that got cancelled (my school only has 5 clubs). My 11th grade scores (the ones that matter the most) are trash. I know the subject and stuff, I just can't perform to everyone's expectations in this country. So, I thought, to show some academic rigor and to get that AP award, I can sign up for a few AP exams and try to score well on them. Well my dumbass didn't realize how hella expensive they are and that you have to register for them by a certain date. I just don't know what I'm going to do. I have a few backups if I don't get into a decent college with aid but I dont like any of them. :(

At this point, it is what it is. I can't change the past but I can certainly work on my present and future. So this is my plan of action: my next school session's going to be offline and i know i can perform better. ill try to get as many good grades as i can before sending in my apps. I've signed up for 3 internships, ill try to get 2 more ecs and sign up for some awards. 

Any help or advice will be extremely appreciated.

Sorry if it ends up being a repost.

So I am in the lucky position of having a lot of choices of what to do this summer, and I'm struggling to pick. Can you guys help me out:

Option 1: Returning to an internship I did with an aerospace start-up I did last summer. They loved me and it was good work. It's a high possibility that they would hire me on in the future after I graduate. They close-ish. It's about an hour and half commute, so I wouldn't have to move but the drive is a drain. But I can work from home some days too. Even if I don't decide to work there this summer they might still want to hire me after graduation since they really liked me, but doing another summer with them would really seal the deal probably.

Option 2: I'm completing my master's with a thesis. My research advisor would like me to do research with him this summer. He's recommended me for a scholarship. No word on if I'll win it or not yet though. This would be something that's more of an obligation. I had a desire to graduate with a thesis, but as time goes on, this desire is starting to wane and I don't see myself going back to school for a PhD which would be the main benefit. But being future-proof isn't that bad of an idea right? If I win the scholarship I would feel even more obligated to take this, because my professor would have been the one who signed me up and essentially got it to me.

Option 3: I've been applying to NASA internships every summer, and so far no luck. However this year I've just been reached out to for a virtual NASA internship. It's been my dream to get a NASA internship for a long time, but now I'm wondering if I'm squandering my other options if I take it. But it's virtual so no commuting, and it's NASA.

So I'm struggling to decide between the probably-sure-thing, the obligation, and the dream.

Any tips?"
m25z0o,0,2021-03-10,Should I leave a comfortable stable job where I'm respected for something more flexible?,manymenwishdeathupon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m25z0o/should_i_leave_a_comfortable_stable_job_where_im/,"I've been at my first full-time job for 1 year and a half now, and got promoted about 5 months ago to SDE2. I have had only 1yr 6mo of full time experience but have been programming for about 10 years now and 2 years of full-time internship experience, so I quickly gained a great reputation across the company (\~300 engineers) especially when it comes to technical things.

I want to grow from a leadership and soft skills perspective because technical growth is not as important to me to go to the next level, and my current company keeps treating me like a baby (patronizing tone from my manager, assuming I don't understand tradeoffs...etc) even compared to people a similar age (I'm in my late 20s) and less overall experience, and it just seems like this idea of me being a new grad affects my growth.

I have an opportunity within the company to move to a very important longterm project that I did the entire initial architecture for. However, because of my level, it seems like once the team actually formed, I won't have any opportunities to lead even in a small way.

I also have an offer from a older stage startup (50 engineers) where I was told that I'm likely to be promoted quickly to a senior and tech lead based on their impression during interviews, and I feel like I can grow more there.

Money wise, they're somewhat comparable. Slightly less guaranteed money at the startup (\~10k) with a lot of stock options.

What do you think I should do?"

I am also going to use the past two years for reference.

I have been doing a lot of research about churn and have talked to my manager. He did mentioned it was going to be very difficult and he is not expecting something very complicated. But, I don't know where to start at all. I tried google search, but almost everything is using like SQL or machine learning.

I’m currently a fourth year CS major with very few potential internship opportunities this summer, and they’re all extremely low paying. For example, I just wrapped up an interview with a very well known US professional sports team for a Data Analytics Internship, which pays $10 / hour, far below what I was hoping for. To me, it seems kind of unfair compared to my previous experiences, especially since this is quite a large organization"
m2a48s,48,2021-03-10,go bears :(,yhn73t49,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m2a48s/go_bears/,"Hello, junior data science major concentration in business analytics. 

I really enjoy data science, I really do, but honestly, recruiting has been the most painful and heartbreaking thing ever. Every time I open up Handshake or start searching for internships, I cry. The difficulty in getting an internship has put me off the major and actually enjoying school so much.

I don't know what to do- recruiting is practically over for this summer, and I still have no offers. Everyone I talk to who had an internship program last summer cancelled immediately somehow got a different internship elsewhere. I'm no EECS god in programming, but I can get by. I do well in my classes. Every CS major gets into SWE and keeps posting about their $100K salary and then seems shocked when I ask for advice on how they got into an internship and they say that the company practically came to them with job offers or that they knew a parent/parent's friend that got them a referral. 

I'm an AAPI in college (got us citizenship tho yay). My family is one of cleaners and cooks and farmers and no one in my family went into tech. I'm the first. I don't know how to navigate this market and I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how this white collar work-world works with referrals and connections and crap. It's so frustrating. I've been using Handshake and Glassdoor and emailing recruiters without luck. I tried the career center and all they said was that getting a summer internship is hard and to try the career fairs, and that data science is a hard major to get a career out. 

I have massive debt and feel like absolute shit that I can't even get a single INTERNSHIP much less a full-time job. My parents were so proud that they had a kid get into college, so I guess their bright Berkeley kid is not as bright as they once thought. And now that my dad is older, he's waiting until I get a job to retire so I can help pay our bills and pay off my debt and help my younger siblings get into college. If getting an internship is this much of a nightmare, I can't imagine what full-time job searching is like. I'm so frustrated and confused and have no idea who to turn to for help and also my landlord is kicking my family out of our apartment in a few months since he's bulldozing it to fix it up and sell so that's great to deal with during midterm week. All I want to is to graduate, pay off my debt, get a job, and buy my family our first permanent home instead of bouncing from crappy rental to crappy rental. 

How can I get into an internship? I'll take anything at this point even relatively related to my major, even in business - I need the summer income and tutoring doesn't provide too much consistent income. Is getting an internship before senior year 100% necessary to get a job? I need help and advice. Please. It's not well-written but honestly, I just came out of a midterm that I cried through and I'm crying through this too and I have another midterm to cry through tonight as well."

I actually also wanted to do so this year but unfortunately out of the 5 Big-N companies I got summer offers from and wanted to intern at, none of them allow fall.

The companies I'm aware of are that do so are F, Snap, Lyft, Uber, Linked, Appl and Coin.

Companies I'd be interested in knowing about are G, N, Dropbox, Pins, Stripe, Square, Slack, Twilio, Palantir, MSFT, Adobe, etc.

And just as a resource to others, companies I interviewed/spoke with that didn't give me that option were Dash, Amzn, Msft, Twtr, Salesforce, Twitch and Splunk. 2 of the 3 unicorn startups I spoke with (Confluent and Verkada) were flexible on season though, and the third (Coursera) had a separate winter posting. So startups may be more flexible on avg. 

Some of those companies like Salesforce and M do have fall co-op however, for a few co-op schools including RIT, GaTech, uWaterloo and uToronto. Unfortunately I wasn't eligible for that though."

So I started sending cv’s to internships to see if I could get something. I did a couple interviews and got 2 offers, both to big companies, one in Belgium for 6 months and another in Dubai for 6 months too. Both are paid but just barely enough to cover expenses… Should I just quit my job and try to go for these internships to get a different experience and eventually improve my cv?

m2ebod,2,2021-03-10,Is an Associate's Degree in CS be sufficient if I already have internship experience?,BVue,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m2ebod/is_an_associates_degree_in_cs_be_sufficient_if_i/,"Quick background, I was able to get an internship while I was still in High School (_I also did Post Secondary at the time as well, earning college credits for free_). 

I just feel like going for the bachelor's is the foundation of getting your foot into the professional industry. But since I'm already in (_sort of…_), wouldn't it be best to at least finish what I'm aiming for (_A.S. Comp Sci_), then just focus entirely on work?

So, with about 1.5-2 years of professional intern experience under my belt so far, would an Associate's Degree in Computer Science be sufficient for me to get through HR? I've read around other subreddit posts about an Associate being useless for Computer Science, but with experience, will it matter?"
m2edg6,4,2021-03-10,Chance me UCLA computer science,alt8373738283,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/m2edg6/chance_me_ucla_computer_science/,"So for starters, I'm only a sophomore in high school but Ive spent a lot of time researching colleges. I was initially really optimistic and wanted to go to MIT or something similar, but as heartbreaking as it is, I don't think it will ever happen. I'm extremely competent in the area of computer science, but my standardized test scores and grades are subpar.

I have a 3.7 cumulative gpa (3.9 right now, I intend on keeping it here for the remainder of high school). My weighted gpa is a 4.1 cumulative, and a 4.3 right now (taking every high level class offered). And a 1230 PSAT score (math score is lower), and a 26 preACT score (preACT score was last year and I didn't take it super seriously). These stats while good, aren't selective college worthy (per my limited understanding)

I also do a large variety of sports, I'm on the swim team, tennis team, and I do crossfit simultaneously with all of these. (I intend on joining swim and tennis every consecutive year)

My quirk, is that I'm great with computers. I'm an intern/apprentice at a mid-sized cybersecurity firm doing application security. I'm good at it, I function really well in a professional environment, and I anticipate having a professional relationship, whether internship, or loose training, with this company for at least 2 years. I have extensive projects online, that if taken into account, are quite impressive.

So what type of schools can I aim for? Would UCLA be possible? If not, what would be a better aim? And if so, how high could I go? I'm horrible at studying (never have had to), and I'm curious, if I gained that skill, could I improve my SAT/ACT scores enough? I think of the average Ivy league student, as someone who started a business, or got a perfect score on the SAT. Is this accurate? Or do I have a shot."

I am about to graduate pretty early with my bachelor's degree in CS. Got my associates in high school so there was several years' worth of credit transfer in. While doing the degree I have worked a full-time retail job and have done a remote internship part-time which is coming to an end. I am interested in breaking into the fintech industry. Always had a love for business, money, and finance but I was also really into programming so I ultimately decided to pursue CS. Though I am now considering pursuing an MBA to further strengthen my business knowledge and make me stand out more to employers. I would be taking it at WGU so it would take about 6 months to one year to complete and it would be fully reimbursed by my employer so there would be zero loans involve. Financially I have been living with my parents while working so bills have been much lower but the tech scene is pretty dead where I live and the closest tech area is an hour away in Memphis. Would it make sense to build some projects on the side as well as get my MBA before I move? I plan on moving out of my parents in about a year once I have saved a little bit more money. While the cost and time don't seem to be much of a problem, my ultimate goal is to break into the fintech industry and I have mixed things from associates and people through my college about whether an MBA would be any real help outside of management roles 5 plus years down the road. I kinda agree to an extent but an MBA is the only thing my job will pay for and if it is free then why not? Would appreciate any advice before I commit the next 6 months to more school work. Thanks in advance!"

I left for a co-op position that was a wonderful resume builder for me, but when I left school in Fall of 2019 the world was a different place. I was lucky (in my opinion) to be in the workforce for most all of 2020 and not in college, but now I have come back to a pre-established online learning system and it is KILLING me. 
I was already very rusty on my advanced mathematics and now I am thrown back into classes that talk like I had learned the material yesterday from Isaac Newton himself. My Aerodynamics professor talks about Calc 2 and 3 principles like they are nothing, but for me, it has been 2-4 years since I have learned those things. I am failing everything so so hard and it is killing me. I am a student who has been in engineering since the start, I know what it's like to spend most of my weekends studying, watching friends go have fun, etc.... I get that that is the nature of engineering schooling lifestyle, but the difference this semester is I feel like I have to try my hardest just to stay afloat. I get about 4 hours of sleep a night and I cannot put more hours into my schoolwork... I promise you, I physically cannot, and yet I am still unable to catch up.
My professors seem so heartless when I approach them about my struggles. Even my academic advisor was like ""tough luck... keep at it."" My professors write fast, and a lot of them aren't even live lectures, so I'm unable to even get clarification where I need it. 
I used to be a A -B student with ease. I was the one asking meaningful questions, I was the one thinking about how the concepts taught in class could be applied to things I've seen in real life.. always genuinely excited to learn, but now I feel so defeated. I feel stuck. I feel behind. I feel like a complete failure, and I just don't know what to do. I'm trying so dang hard and I am still exhausted and have nothing to show for it.
I am SYSTEMATICALLY behind and I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any advice or some kind of a sliver of hope to offer? I currently don't see a way out of this and I feel like nobody even knows about or cares about my struggles."

A good friend of mine wants me to try and get experience to leverage to move to a new job-whether that be an internship, a consultant project, a regular FTE etc. I did this a few years ago trying to switch jobs (pre-covid), and I was turned down constantly. I got close a few times, but I was ultimately turned rejected. I don’t know for sure, but I think my interview was weak because I was trying to move into a field I wasn’t very familiar with: business analysis. I also didn’t know some of the tools/software they asked about. Previously, I had been working in tech support. 

So from 2020 to 2021, after I got laid off due to covid, I decided to make myself better. I built a website, youtube channel, redid my resume, LinkedIn, and started going through books, tutorials, and practicing hands-on to learn these skills. Am I an absolute expert? No. But I am a lot more competent then when I started. I’m just using my unemployment time, like most people (I would hope), wisely. Should I continue to use the next five or six months to continue bettering myself in this way or apply now and just cut these side projects short? Once I start working my time becomes very limited. Thanks for any advice.

PS. I am currently trying to learn Python, AWS, and Azure a bit more."

m2je82,3,2021-03-11,People are Meaner to me when I am Shy / Nervous,CloroxTrashBag,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/m2je82/people_are_meaner_to_me_when_i_am_shy_nervous/,"When I am VERY nervous /shy people either speak to me like I'm a child or they are rude to me. Certain people treat me like a leper or become really nasty towards me, even when I am nice and polite (just visibly nervous).

I am early 20s female with autism and social anxiety, but I usually get very nervous around people I do not know. I think it's because I'm self-conscious of my appearance. My Uber (passenger) rating is a 4.98 after hundreds of rides. And one driver said I was a ""very easy to talk to""....so I have much more confidence when people aren't looking at my face. I also grew up in the UK, where people are no where near as extroverted and fake ""friendly"" as the average American. I moved to America when I was 15.

I will describe a humiliating experience that happened at an internship several years ago. These two guys (both older than me- one was 26 and the other was 28. I was only 19 at the time) started having a conversation with me.

I struggled to maintain eye contact for most of the conversation and replied to their questions in a mix of short (one word) answers and long, rambling, overly detailed answers.

One guy asked me a question about where I was from ( I grew up in England and now live in America), and I gave him a really long DETAILED description of the street that I lived on, the city I was from, and the school I attended. I was clearly nervous.

He just stared at me with wide eyes and slowly nodded his head at me. He didn't even bother to respond. The second man had to take over the conversation and asked me if I liked football. I just smiled and said ""oh no, not really"". The whole conversation was awkward.

I said Goodbye to them, and the first guy wouldn't even make eye contact with me anymore &amp; he refused to smile or say bye. He ignored me the rest of the internship AND participated in a rumor that I lied about being from England. It was so humiliating. The same rumor surfaced in high school. I think this happens for two reasons. (1) My accent is a mix of English / American, since my mother is American and I only lived in England until I was 15 , (2) I get nervous when people ask me about, I think they will accuse me of lying, so I always give WAY too many details about living there and seem nervous.

Anyway, the guy during the internship would act like he didn't hear me if I asked a question or tried to be friendly to him. He would not make eye contact with me, he gave me one word responses, and he avoided me all the time. Like I was a leper. But he was loud and confident with everyone else. So it was only because he thought I was some freak, not because he was shy. It was really, REALLY hurtful. And I still think about how callous he was. I would never treat another person that way on purpose.

This guy was a self-proclaimed ""nerd"" (on social media), a gay guy,  and a hardcore liberal on social media, so he always claimed to care about ""tolerance"" and inclusivity. That's what ALL his posts were about. But he treated me like I was dirt on the ground. Just because I was nervous and seemed like a freak to him. How ironic. I did not make any rude or nasty comments to him at all"

This is my first time posting to Reddit, so I have no clue if I'm doing this right, or if this will reach anybody, but at this point I'm not sure where else to turn. I think I've exhausted the subject with my roommates, and I just need somewhere to vent. So this is long, which I think goes against the grain of normal Reddit posts (from what I've seen).

I'm currently a biology major at a state university. I'm almost done with my degree - if I pass all my classes this semester I will only need 13 credits left to graduate, which means I'd actually be graduating a semester earlier than anticipated. I haven't had an internship yet, although I'm trying to secure one for this summer. I have a bit of research experience under my belt (unfortunately, my time in the lab was cut short due to the pandemic), and I'm a part of my school's Honors Program. My grades aren't the *best* in the world, but they're still pretty good - I've gotten A's in the vast majority of my classes, B's in two of them, and one C in calculus.

My real problem is organic chemistry. When I took O. Chem I last fall, I got a D in the class. And I won't make excuses, I take full responsibility for that, I did not put in the effort I should have. Then I had a really rough start the next semester with O. Chem II (I was sort of dealing with my first heartbreak, which is very cliché of me, but regardless I fell behind very quickly). By the time we had our second exam I was doing so badly in the class that I decided to withdraw and take another stab at it in the summer. I even planned on retaking O. Chem I first. I was actually looking forward to retaking them this way, because then I would've been able to focus all of my attention on O. Chem without having to worry about any other courses.

Lo and behold, a global pandemic hit, and my university cancelled most of their summer classes. So I'm taking O. Chem II again this spring, along with four other courses. And it's going pretty badly.

I managed to just scrape a C on the first exam (I know that doesn't sound like a big deal to most people, but for me in this course, that might as well be an A+). I've done pretty well on the homework assignments so far, as they're fairly simple. The weekly quizzes have been hit or miss.

But our second exam is coming up within the next couple of days, and I have barely looked at any of the material. I am absolutely terrified. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I could've made time for it, I just...didn't. I kept telling myself, and other people, *repeatedly:* ""My test is coming up, so I really need to study for that."" And then I just didn't!

To be honest I have been really struggling to keep up with the work in all my classes. I'm not sure if I'm feeling this way because of the extenuating circumstances of *trying to be in college during a global pandemic* or if I'm just burnt out. Most of my classes are online, with lectures over zoom. I'm still doing pretty well in 4/5 of them (the obvious exception being O. Chem), but I feel like it's taking so much out of me to achieve that. It's taking a herculean effort to get my work done when it shouldn't be.

I definitely prioritize my other classes over O. Chem, even though that's the one that requires the most studying. I guess the logic behind it is that I know my other grades will suffer if I backburner everything just to spend all my time looking at chemistry. Because I know that even if I do that, it's still very unlikely that I would get anything higher than a C in the class. And I can't justify getting mediocre grades in classes where I know I can do really well for the sake of doing *just a little bit better* in chemistry.

I've always struggled with anxiety, and it got a lot better once I graduated high school, but it's come back with a vengeance this semester. I'm barely sleeping. I stay up all hours of the night, not because I'm up doing homework, but more often than not because I'm terrified of going to sleep, and having to wake up in the morning and face another day of school. One day I woke up for class, shut off my alarm, and just burst into tears because I couldn't stand the thought of having to sit through another lecture. I've been having crying fits almost every day, just out of nowhere, totally uncontrollably. Sometimes it happens more than once in a day. I've been picking at my scalp like crazy, which is a nervous habit I struggle with on and off, but it's been so bad lately that I'm giving myself headaches. I've been having panic attacks. I'm overeating. I haven't been able to go home in over a month because my work is piling up, and I miss my family. I feel like I've barely spoken to any of my friends. I feel like I haven't even seen much of my roommates, because I barely leave my room now.

I feel like all my motivation is gone. I'm stressed about all the work I need to do and the work I haven't done, but instead of that stress putting pressure on me to get going, I just feel paralyzed. I get so overwhelmed that I just think ""is there even a point of me trying to do all this?"" It feels impossible. I feel like I'm drowning. I've had a handful of days where I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed.

I used to be a good student, now I can barely get through the week.

Just thinking about the amount of material I haven't learned in O. Chem is making me nauseous. What's even worse is knowing that I did it to myself. I sat at my desk, and kept telling myself I'd look at the textbooks, that I'd watch the recorded lecture again, that I'd do the practice problems. And then I didn't. I don't know why, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I am certainly going to fail my next exam, and I'm somehow both horrified by and totally numb to the prospect.

Has anybody else had a class required for their major that just totally roadblocked them? Does anybody else feel psychologically scarred by trying to maintain their usual workload in an online environment?

TL;DR - biology student about to fail organic chemistry for the second time, feeling very discouraged about online school. Anybody else struggling?"
m2lfcy,8,2021-03-11,Automatically filling in numbers from one excel document to another!,whateverthefockever,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/m2lfcy/automatically_filling_in_numbers_from_one_excel/,"So I am doing an internship and I just got a small task to calculate average values from one document and inserting them in another document. 

So in the first document I have the item no in column A and this is where I am supposed to insert the average values for that item no in column M. 

In the second document I have all the different values for that item no and this is where I calculate the average. 

I am a complete excel noob and my supervisor helped me create a pivot table in the second document that shows the item no in column A, and the average quantity in column B, so basically what I am doing now is looking at the item no in the first document, searching for that no in the pivottable in the second document, copying the average value for that item no and pasting it into the first document. 

So basically I am going back and forth doing this, ctrl c ctrl v and its like 2000 different item no or something. I was thinking that there has to be a way to have excel doing this for me and fill it in automatically from the second document into the first document without me having to manually copy paste it. Also if Im able to find a smart solution for this, it will make me look good :D 

Is there a better way?"

I spent a quarter working as a TA in one of the CS courses and as of next month I will have been working in a software development internship for about 2 years now in a full-stack development role. They have been very flexible and gave me a unique opportunity to essentially work through college, but unfortunately they are not a growing company and are really actually moving most of their operations overseas as they were bought out by a larger conglomerate a few years ago. I actually just found out today that they are ending the intern program and scaling back (although I have until summer).

I am starting to get a little disheartened though. There are always so many jobs getting posted, but seems like it is nearly impossible to get an interview, which I was not expecting having had a fairly solid background. It isn't like I got a degree, did no personal projects, and didn't have work experience. Is it just really that hard to break into a full-time junior role or has the COVID situation really impacted things that significantly. I know a few companies (especially in travel) that have laid off a lot of employees, so understandable that there is an imbalance. Not to say I haven't had ANY interviews, but the ones I did interview for seemed to get turned off because I didn't have both development experience and DevOps experience, which was unexpected. Unfortunately these were all through a recruiter as well. I have essentially enjoyed a 0% success with direct applications, despite sending out somewhere around 125 at this point.

Anyone have any insight or similar experiences? Trying to figure out a next step. Unfortunately meet ups and such have been pretty hard during this time as well."

Never worked with development but i'm studying everyday since my cs degree and learned about the programming logic during college, so it's not that hard for me,but i know that the true experience in dev i will get only working at it, i  need to get projects to evolve (maybe trying a jr position in dev).

Maybe the support area is kinda hard to get  a job outside cause most of the work need to be done in loco. So i'm trying to get dev skills because most of the jobs outside are from this area.

I have a huuuuge problem right now. I tried to fix it but got nowhere. This is my first time writing on any forum, i tought ill give it a chance. Lets see what u got.  
So the problem:, my notebook is  Y50-70 Laptop (Lenovo) - Type 20378 . bios type: 9ECN43WW (V3.03).   
Intern display on this notebook does not work, but that's okay, im using an tv as external display. Im doing work on my notebook, music and graphic stuff, and i got an Virus into my lap, i couldnt delete it and the virus was shutting down my defender/firewall and other apps and it was mining bitcoins.  


I decided to create an bootable USB with ESYSRESCUE (eset) to delete the virus before the virus even starts to operate. Keep in mind im not experienced in this, so i tought i need to switch from UEFI to Legacy Bios, which i did...and yeah...my external screen is getting ''no signal'' since 2 days ago.  


That means i cant see anything.   


Solutions i tried and im trying to do:   


I tried resseting bios, remove COMS battery, do every kind of reset found on forums with simmiliar probems. Intern Display is unplugged from motherboard (I USE HDMI TO TV FOR MY EXTERNAL DISPLAY), i tried removing HDD also replacing HDD. I spent one whole night trying to blindly navigate in bios to reset it to default state, i gave up there, i think my bios is not running actually. because F10 to save and exit did not shut my pc nor booted to windows where i would actually see the desktop on my external display. I tried any kind of combinations but nothing happened.   


Since im thinking that bios may be corrupted or just wont start. Im trying to boot it from USB.  


I tried to create an win10 bootable usb, put it in, still no signal on external, an hour ago i created an bootable usb with my BIOS version downloaded. (i used rufus to create an bootable usb for UEFI/BIOS) but im still getting no signal on my tv. I tried contacting lenovo with live chat, but the guy seemed to not even know what time is it, simply said that he is sorry, that i tried everything he was going to suggest and sent me an link to repair and pricing list. It's a shame that i currently have like a few euros left for food and living stuff so i cant afford to put it somewhere, also my work depends on that ntb, im currently losing work, money and life with this problem.  


If anyone can get me some ideas i did not tried. I would be absolutely gratefull!!   


PS: im thinking of some way to rewrite bios using usb, to use only external display (hdmi) but im not really a tech guy so i dont know how to do that.  


Thanks to anyone who will give me an advice."

I had the chance to discuss with some recruiters and they all basically said the same thing: “you need soft skills backed by specific examples from your life, you need personal projects to speak about during interview, you need to know several technologies.” Given the fact that it’s a student internship, they probably don’t expect too much, but I’m not even a mediocre candidate in my opinion. 

I have zero personal projects due to my procrastination and lack of motivation. I don’t even have a uni project to show them, because I wasn’t able to write an error-free program for class and failed all of my programming classes from last year and last semester. 

Now I’m forced to take 9 different classes, I must research for my undergraduate thesis for next year and have a busy schedule. I start studying at 8 am and finish my classes at 8 pm, then I’ll do my assignments at night. The same story during weekend. 

Maybe it’s not much, but I feel close to burnout, especially that I suffer from depression and anxiety. Staying 24/24 at home makes it worse and makes me lose my motivation to start anything. 


What would be the best approach for me? Building something very simple for this summer and hope for the best? Working on side projects during summer and waiting for a next year chance? Asking a friend who’s a manager at a software company to give me some fake internship documents so that I’m allowed by uni to at least graduate?"

[URGENT],lethaios,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/m2q43c/berlin_which_of_those_two_offers_should_i_accept/,"I recently received two offers from two companies (After a 3-month job search) in Berlin and I am urged to choose one until tomorrow. I would like your opinion:

# Offer 1

**Position:** Security Engineer Intern (6-month with potential to renew full-time after with higher salary)

**Company:** 1001-5000 people

**Salary:** 2500€/ month gross which translates to 1700€/month net

**More info:** Big well-established company.

# Offer 2

**Position:** Mid/Senior Python Engineer (Full-time)

**Company:** 16 people (start-up)

**Salary:** 5000€/ month gross which translates to 3000€/month net

**More info:** Small start-up working on a very interesting product and already has two big factories as clients. I see great potential in them. VC funded

\------------------------------------------------

I am currently based in Athens. I am a 25-year old with a degree in CS, currently pursuing a master's and several years of work experience. Therefore I am moving to Berlin to work. Both opportunities seem exciting. Money-wise the second offer is apparently better. Company-wise, the first is probably a wiser choice because the company is well established and respected in the B2C market.

**Additional Info**

\- Working at the company of Offer 2 (the 5k/month) will definitely be more stressful, their expectations seem to be high (although I posses the skills). I think I will manage it, but what if I dont? Nevertheless they seem to be well-organized tech-wise. They have already developed an impressive product. But I am hesitating, I don't know them after all. They are not even on Crunchbase yet. But our interview was warm and nice and my intuition is good about em

I am trying to pursue a career in data science and machine learning, so going off of experience alone, IBM is clearly the better opportunity for me (the position is called Data Analyst but they offer a data science specific track). However, I know that just having Amazon on my resume would be a huge deal. They also pay their interns so much it's hard to turn it down, but I'm trying to focus more on growth potential than up-front salary. The main thing I'm struggling with is if recruiters for data science jobs will be more interested in somebody with actual data science specific experience or if it really does hold that much more weight to work for a FAANG company in a general software engineering context (assuming the LEAP position could pan out into an SDE position the following summer). Any guidance is welcome.

EDIT: The biggest reason I am stuck deciding is because data scientists in general make more money than software engineers. If I took the LEAP position, lots of software engineer positions would be open to me but probably not as many data science positions. If I took the analyst position, I could potentially get a data science internship at a bigger name company."

My resume has 3 internships at small startups with 10-15 employees, each internship spanning around 2-4 months, which I did in past 1 year in the lockdown (WFH). 

When I start to apply at Big-N, can these experience be helpful in getting a callback? provided that I have gained a lot of experience from these internships and contributed a lot too. Or do they just ignore my experiences since they are all small companies? 

And also, if I apply for a company like Google in the US branch and if my country also has a branch which hires interns, and I get selected by the US branch, do they give me a chance to work in the US? Or do they match me to the local branch in my country?

Under a lot of stress I signed the other job offer and put my two weeks in but every day of my last two weeks at my job I have been regretting it. The pay at my current job full time is much better then the pay at the new job offer (however the commute for my current job would be 1.5 - 2hrs once in office. I explained this to my current manager that it’s a lot and she said I would only have to go in once a week). I don’t want to regret my decision forever and it’s taking a toll on me.

It broke me down. I started to doubt myself more than usual. But one day I figured the issue maybe wasn't me, but my lack of experience working in the public sector (that's where most of my applications went). 

So I applied for an internship at a government authority. 300 people applied. And I got it. I've been there for almost three months now.

The first job application I sent out after being able to put on my CV that I have experience from this type of work, they called back. 

THEY CALLED BACK.

I went to the interview, handed over my references, and waited. And guys, today it happened. I was offered my first ever full time job and couldn't be happier. And they seemed genuinely happy that I accepted and mentioned how they really wanted me to come work for them.

So my question is at what stage should I perform feature selection? In the beginning of the project, once and for all, and then try running that reduced data set through the algorithms or would you typically make a feature selection that is specific to each algorithm you are running the data through? I can't work out if there's any difference between those two options.

m2t2b7,2,2021-03-11,Pressure Against Meds,yamantheo,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/m2t2b7/pressure_against_meds/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post in this sub, and I’m new to my ADHD diagnosis, so bear with me.

I recently completed a test assigned by my doctor to evaluate me for ADHD, depression and/or anxiety. The test results came out that there is definitely something going on with me with respect to all 3. I was shocked, because the test didn’t disclose what I was answering when. 

But as it is currently assumed, I have an overlap with all 3 (primarily ADHD), and after some self-reflection, I can see and understand that.

Where I’m stuck is dealing with the aftermath of my diagnosis and my family - I am currently 21 and I can make my own medical decisions, but I am getting berated and guilted into not getting prescribed meds by my doctor because my parents (mother specifically) think I don’t have ADHD. She went on a 2-hour rant on how I shouldn’t take meds, rather combat my ‘ADHD’ with smaller tasks throughout the day, which would be fine...if I could remember when to do them. 

It is really disheartening because I usually am one to confide in my parents when I need help with serious things, and this is something I knew I needed help with since I started my undergraduate degree 3 years ago. 

I thought maybe getting a diagnosis and getting meds would help me with my focus and in turn improve my grades. I am currently right in the middle of the pack, but I want to improve them, but I have never found myself able to ‘work harder’ than I already do, because if I try and hyper-focus, it will only last for 20 minutes or less. 

I am also currently working an internship from my home, which is in the same room that I sleep in, and I think if anything, it has made my ADHD worse, in turn, making me feel extremely unmotivated and sad at most times. I can barely get up and “go to work” in the morning, and manage to keep my living space clean right now. I just feel so stuck and frustrated!

TL;DR - I would just like to know if anyone feels ‘stuck’ right now and if anyone can speak on an experience where they have dealt with negative responses from loved ones on meds."

I need an advise.

I have been offered IT intern role by 3 different companies for 4.5 months: GovTech, Munich Re and Accenture

But I am unsure on which offer to accept.

Should i work in GovTech or one of the above MNC? 

Monthly stipend wise, govtech is paying me almost more than double of what both the mnc's has to offer and is fully work from home. (my spending habit is that i am rather conservative)

accenture is only paying a 100$ more than what munich re is offering tho. Both are about less than or equal to half of what govtech is offering.

Workload wise munich re might be slightly relaxed compared to govtech and accenture but is partially occasionally work from home - might need to go onsite twice a week.

Accenture on the other hand can't confirm yet if its onsite or wfh.

Any advice on which company should I choose.  Is the mnc branding name important for future prospects? I know that the government agency names in SG are always changing few years down the road lol.

Which one would you all recommend me to choose? 

Really in a dilemma. Pls advice. Thanks

I am having to speak English as a second language which is challenging, but it is certainly a good opportunity to strengthen my language skills. 

I am working for a company as an unpaid intern for the next 2 months. The work itself can be very demanding, but I do not mind most of it. I can tell I am given a lot of tedious work that the rest of the department doesn't want to do, but I can deal with that. It is 8 hours of work every day 5 days a week. I have to finish this internship if I want to graduate this year. 

What has been concerning me the most is that my manager will sometimes completely berate me if I do a task wrong or if something doesn't go as expected. Some things that go wrong every day and sometimes are completely out of my control (computer error, internet connection issues, normally technical stuff).  Some days, I will get constant messages to do tasks, even after working hours, and my manager will get pissed if I don't respond. When I make mistakes, I will get messages like ""How could you have done this?"", ""I don't know what is going on with you today"", or ""How do you not know how to do such a simple task?"". I have even gotten the eye-rolling and face palm emojis. I put enough pressure on myself, but getting these kinds of comments can really hurt and make me unmotivated and afraid to do any work.

I'm starting to worry that this internship is messing with my mental health and wellbeing. I suffer from anxiety and depression due to being on the spectrum, and working with people like this has been sending me into panic attacks and emotional breakdowns almost every day which I have not experienced for years. I am getting 8 hours of sleep every night, but I am finding myself having to take multiple naps during the day. For the past week, I noticed an intense tightness in my chest and pain in my upper left shoulder. I am worried that one day I will get a heart attack or something from the constant stress that they are putting me in. 

Is this kind of treatment towards interns normal? I am really trying to give the benefit of the doubt and maybe consider cultural differences, but I have never been treated like this in a workplace before. How can I report this kind of treatment without risking my position?"

I've got a CS degree and I'm about 3yrs into my career. I've been with the same company the whole time - I started out as an intern, got promoted and worked on a devops team for a bit, and then finally landed a more generic engineering role after yet another promotion (CM, automation, general infrastructure ops stuff). You'd think things are going great however I've got major imposter syndrome.

I feel like I've gotten promoted constantly due to my work ethic/ adaptability and the ease at which I pick up Institutional knowledge, however my actual technical expertise is lacking in my opinion. I've never been one to code or build things during my off time, or be super enthused about delving into complicated, systems related issues. Sure, I may find a one off project or other small task interesting here and there, but for the most part I feel like nothing related to my work gets me excited (and as a result, my technical knowledge slips because I'm not interested enough to learn). 

With all that outta the way, I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar early on in their careers? Im starting to feel like now is bout the time to transition into something else (although I have no idea what ""something else"" would be)."

I’ve been waiting to hear back from an (internship) interview for a bit, and I wanted to get some advice on the timing of my follow-up.

To keep things simple, here’s a timeline of where I’m at with the final interview round:

- Final Interview 1: 2/22
- Final Interview 2: 2/23
- Thank you’s sent (via recruiter): 2/23
- Asked for an update on interview process: 3/1
- Received update: 3/3

With respect to the update I received, I was told that the last interview for this position would be occurring 3/8 (this previous Monday), and that “a decision would be made shortly after”.

Would it be appropriate for me to follow up again tomorrow (3/12) to try and get another update, or could that be interpreted as annoying?  If yes, should I wait until the end of the day (just in case they send out a decision really late), or should I send out that email with a little time left in the day for them to respond?"

I know my gpa could be higher, but I had an amazing first-year first-semester, and I would not change anything about that.

I have been particularly anxious after getting waitlisted by my own university and getting rejected by two other schools. I am also an international student, so if I do not get into any program, I just need to leave the U.S. where all my friends are. I am waiting to hear back from two more schools, but those schools were my ""reach"" schools.

I look through gradcafe and this channel; I see these uber-talented applicants with 5 years of work experience, and I simply do not know how I can be a match to them. With unemployment this high and no graduate school, I feel as if I ran out of options after graduation.

This is my senior spring, when I should be having the last fun with my friends in college. With the ongoing pandemic and the anxiety induced from my current situation, I really cannot enjoy or appreciate any part of this.

I immediately started posting my resume on various job search platforms, and started contacting recruiters nationwide.  I'm located in Washington State, but I'm willing to relocate just about anywhere.  The software engineer job search is a grind, and I've been working hard at it, but from first contact to decision seems to  take a long time (on average it seems to be about 5 weeks).  I've had several rejections, but now this morning I finally got an offer.  The problem is that I also finished two final round interviews today for organizations that I think would be a much better fit for me.   One of them looks very promising for an offer (although I've been wrong before), and they both guaranteed me a response by next week.

The offer is for a job in Mountain View, CA for $105k.  I'm married with two kids, and my biggest concern is that I won't be able to support my family for that pay in one of the most expensive areas in the U.S.  The offer doesn't have any bonuses, but has standard health care options and a relocation package.  I'm not worried about the relocation package (I can pay for my own relocation if necessary).  They've only given me two days to make a decision, but luckily they told me on Thursday so I get until Monday.

I know no one is going to tell me how to live my life, but I'm hoping I can get some insight into the offer and if I should counter-offer, or if it is a ridiculous offer that I should decline.  The job I really like is in Colorado, for less pay, but for an organization that looks incredible in an area which has a much lower cost of living compared to CA.  I'm just concerned that if I turn this offer down, and don't get hired at the place I'm hoping for, than I won't get another offer for a long time.

Right now, I'm a 22yr computer engineer major with 11 more classes after this semester ends and I feel like I'm not doing anything right. To start with today, my hardest day of the week, I had a lab for 3 hours, 2 classes back to back right after lab, about 2 hour break, lecture, another 2 hour break, and then another lab(I have no mental energy to focus in class). Today was alright, I got plenty of sleep. I think I did okay on my midterm, wasted my break my doing nothing, and then people in our discord started talking. I try to talk to them but kind of get ignored :/ oh well. Anyways they were talking about internships and how they got some(I plan on talking to one of them tomorrow and asking, a few friends, and my professors). I feel bad because I'm not in the groups that they are in, I didn't get the internships they did, not doing as great as they are(I know I'm not suppose to be comparing myself to them in a negative way because we lived different lives BUT...).

I kind of lost motivation for a lot of things. I used to workout, work 20 hrs a week, hw(I have 2 labs and 4 lecture), I want continue to learn web dev, read, game (not much of a social life. kind of just one friend from highschool I hangout with and a few people from class). I just don't have and see motivation to do these things. I just see things stacking up and it never stops. Why work hard if I'm just going to have to do it again with no reward in sight? I get little dopamine rushes from games and Netflix now. I think one large factor is my ex is in my mind now(together for 4 years and ex's for 4-5). Back to working hard, If I cook my own meals/eat healthy, it cost time and money(I have to work more and if I work more I want to save money for xyz) i have less time I cant take my time on hw and just so many problems... I get no rush from doing anything. Another thing is covid, it has limited my social exposure but not by much. I guess I feel like everything I do isnt going to help me. 

What's my plan? IDK, I don't know what can get me up and going again. I want to get an internship this summer, I want to start cooking my meals again, I want to start working more to pay for my own things, I want to get into a hobbies(web dev) so I can be doing something that will benefit me. I just feel like I am missing something that makes it worth the work :/ I plan on contacting my counseling service this week(spring break)

m3aqz0,1,2021-03-12,Engineering Summer Internship Offers - Industry vs. Research Institute,Pakucho,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/m3aqz0/engineering_summer_internship_offers_industry_vs/,"First, I'll provide a little context about my situation. I'm an ECE master's student in the Midwest focused on Embedded Systems. I've been pursuing a summer internship for some time, and have been given offers from two different places, one company and one research institute (RI). Right now, I'm very torn between the two offers, and am wondering if any veterans or people who have been in my place before might be able to provide some perspective.

For the industry offer, I've been given the opportunity to work at a company in the Portland, OR area working on Analog SoC designs. The day-to-day tasks would be things such as FPGA design/verification, PCB schematic/layout, and embedded firmware development. From what I can gather, it's a small-company vibe, as the location I'd be at was a startup that got acquired several years ago. I would be required to relocate as it is an in-person internship. Thankfully, their internship program provides health insurance, a housing stipend, and relocation reimbursement.

For the RI offer, I've been offered a virtual internship (the RI is in Atlanta, GA) where I would join a team working in custom electro-optical systems. I'd be doing work related to embedded sw development, data analysis, and custom hw (FPGA) design/testing. With it being virtual, basically the only benefit I'd receive is my salary.

As far as salary goes, both positions are roughly equivalent. Also, I'm very interested in the technical work that goes on in both places, and have gotten along with the managers as well. Both places are also relatively renowned, with the 1st offer being an S&amp;P 500 company and the RI being attached to a prestigious engineering school. While I do value having an in-person experience, moving 1800+ miles away for a summer to a place I've never been to does seem a bit daunting. I'm not sure what Portland in general is like, but I do feel like the work itself would be fulfilling. However, I feel the same way about the work at the RI as well. I feel like part of what's made this decision difficult for me is that objectively, they seem almost equal.

Perhaps I'm confusing myself too much on the decision here, and just need to give it some thought on my own. However, I am definitely curious to see what the community thinks. I'll put this as a disclaimer now: I take full responsibility for the opportunity I choose, so don't feel shy to express any perspectives that may lean one way or the other.

So, what do you all think?"

Back when I was in highschool I never felt the need to do a million things but now that I'm in University I feel like I need to constantly be doing something. My university program has a pretty heavy workload which is coupled with a coop program which means I have to apply for jobs during my study terms. I find that after I end each day going through lectures and working on labs, problem sets, and studying I feel so unmotivated to do anything and I constantly feel burnt out.

I feel the constant need to keep up with my studies, work on my art (I enjoy making art), work on side projects that will benefit my resume and experience, help out around the house, land the perfect internship, and a million billion other things.

I know this is nothing compared to what other people face on a regular basis but I just wanted to see if there is anyone else out there who feels constantly burnt out trying to keep up and trying to think about what's best for the future version of yourself.

My manager had to fight extremely hard to get non-regular headcount to get me on the team, so I don't want to come off as ungrateful in any way.

I am within the first generation in my family to go to college. When I told my parents that I got accepted to Cal, they didn't even know what it was. I was raised in a religion that vilified higher education, so needless to say I did not have exposure to the traditional ""higher education"" path that lots of Berkeley kids get before being accepted. Competitive math being one of them.

Today I struggle in the more mathy classes for CS even though I did really well in my community college. Goes to show the difference in understanding required. I did really poorly last semester and so I'm taking a mental health break this semester (also cuz 'rona ain't it, bruh). So I'm looking for something (other than leetcode and a couple of personal projects and applying for internships) to help me build that math maturity that I missed out on when I didn't do competitive math in high school. 

My question is this: would it be wiser to audit a couple of courses from Cal (ik super late but it doesn't really matter, does it?) like EECS 126/127 and try to get better at them from exposure, or should I try to establish a missing maturity basis by doing a bunch of math competition prep (AMC/AIME/USAMO)?"

I was able to get an interview with a small company but they ghosted me after the second round. Which is weird since I nailed the technical question and even had time to further optimize it. 

Having anxiety about my life since a lot of my friends are heading on to law school, med school, dentist school, etc. and it seems their careers are more fixed and stable than CS. They *know* where they'll be in a few years. Will I?

Not to sound cocky but I thought I would at least snag an internship comfortably. Didn't expect this level of pushback.

I'm a prospective CS Major and I had a few questions about the Purdue CS Program:

1.) How would you guys say the scene is? I looked in the subreddit but found conflicting information (either old info or some people say its great some people say no big companies come here because Indiana is ""dead""). I don't need a FAANG/Unicorn, just a company that pays pretty well for internships. Does Purdue facilitate these internships well?

2.) How is West Lafayette as an area? It's completely new to me, so I'm interested how you guys like it. Is there a good social scene/stuff to do, and is there a good work/life balance in CS?

3.) Does ""name brand"" really matter for CS? Again, I've heard a lot of conflicting information, but just to be transparent Purdue is currently my most expensive option. I'm not ruling it out, but I could really only justify paying a couple tens of thousands more if ranking/prestige matters as much as some people say it does.

Thankyou. : &gt;

I  know the decision is ultimately up to me to make, but I'm just curious  what you would do. Since a lot of people have been making polls like  these on this subreddit, I figured I would do the same.

I am a junior undergraduate who has had three prior internships.

**Internship 1:**

* $20/hr pay
* Smaller company (strong chance you haven't heard of the company before)
* Company's name is similar to Big Mac but you replace the word ""Big"" with the name of a U.S. coin
* Remote internship, but company's corporate HQ is in the Los Angeles, California area
* 14 weeks internship
* Will  get paid approximately $2400 more at the end of the summer as this  internship is longer than internship 2. That's not a sum of money to be  taken lightly
* Will be busy and doing something constructive for almost the entire summer vacation
* Will be able to learn and make meaningful contributions. Not as much control on the work I do as internship 2
* Familiar with some of the tech stack that I'll be using for the intern project
* Experience and brand value won't be as valuable as internship 2

**Internship 2:**

* $22/hr pay
* Fortune 50 (not 500, 50) company (if you live in the US, you most likely know what this company is and what they are known for)
* Company's name rhymes with ""Hose"" and is the opposite of ""Highs""
* Remote internship, but company's corporate HQ is in the Charlotte, North Carolina area
* 10 weeks internship
* Won't get paid as much as internship 1 ($2400 less)
* Will have a lot more free time as the internship is shorter
* I   get to choose what kind of project I want to work on in my internship   (web dev, frontend, backend, mobile dev, iOS, Android, desktop dev,   etc.). Company will ship me any technology I need to complete project.   This gives me the ability to learn more than what I would learn in   internship 1 as I can choose to work with a tech stack I've never used   before.
* Money and time aside, experience and brand value would be much more valuable than internship 1

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My  parents are supporting me financially until I graduate college, if that  matters. So losing $2400 by choosing internship 2 is not the end of the  world.

m407du,3,2021-03-13,Burned out at job but afraid to leave,Few_Dragonfruit7251,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/m407du/burned_out_at_job_but_afraid_to_leave/,"I'm 28 and burned out. I would not have expected to be burned out this soon, but unfortunately it's really getting to me. I'm crying at work (I work from home), I can't concentrate, and I feel anxious all the time. It has got to the point that I am looking at anxiety medication to help me through. It wasn't always this bad, but it's got worse over the past 5 months. Our company is understaffed and underpaid and on top of the pandemic response we are doing, I am working 3 roles for the pay of 1. My boss is leaving and I am expected to take an even higher pressure position to help fill her role. I am exhausted. I don't even enjoy my job because it is so high pressure and high stakes, and I am far away from what I do like--interacting with clients.

I know that this isn't sustainable because I am having breakdowns a few times a month. I can't take time off because we don't have enough people to support this project. I recently interviewed and was offered a position for a job though that is a lot lower stress, client facing, and pays about the same as my current role. I am so tempted to go... but I am also really scared.

Here are my concerns:

1. I'm afraid I'm going to be a job hopper. At 28, someone told me I'm nearing mid-career which is a little terrifying! I still feel like I have so much to learn. I graduated from college in 2014, went straight to grad school and graduated in 2016. I worked a job in grad school for 2 years along with an internship. Then my first professional job was for 22 months, and I left that job to move with my partner across the country. I moved up to a higher role that turned out to be a very toxic environment, but stayed for 17 months because I didn't want to be a ""quitter."" And now I'm in my current role for a little over 1 year, which was also a step up in my career. If I leave now, and take this other position (which is a 1 year contract position with options to renew), I'm afraid I'm going to ruin my resume since I haven't stayed in a job for two years since grad school in 2016. I do have really great references though.
2.   If I quit now, my boss is also leaving, and I know they expect me to help keep things afloat and continue running these projects. I know there won't be a raise because we're on a freeze with raises for the next year. But I feel guilty leaving, and also afraid that they will be mad that I leave when my boss is about to go too.

But I know my health is suffering. Each day I think that I'd rather be hit by a bus or have some emergency that would take me away from my job. I was really hoping this would be The Job for me, the one I'd stay long term--but I don't think I'm a good fit for such a high pressure environment. I'm disappointed in myself, but... I don't know. I feel stuck.

Should I push through another year and stay to add a two year stint on my resume? Or can I pursue this lower stress job? Am I ruining my career by making these changes?"

m44v32,3,2021-03-13,"STM32H743 ETH interface, fatal bus error when reading descriptors",Scrashdown,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/m44v32/stm32h743_eth_interface_fatal_bus_error_when/,"First let me warn you I am kind of a newcomer to embedded systems and microcontroller programming, so please excuse me if I am missing something obvious.

# Context

As part of my internship, I have to write a driver for the STM32H743 microcontroller's ETH interface, on the Nucleo H743ZI2 board. I then have to integrate this driver with my company's in-house, proprietary RTOS. We are aware a driver already exists in the STM32Cube library, but my supervisors want me to implement one from scratch.

*Note: as my work is on a proprietary RTOS, I unfortunately cannot show you my code directly.*

The ETH interface is made up of several sub-units, one of them being the DMA subunit which handles data transfers between the ETH interface and other devices connected on an AHB bus.

This DMA subunit reads descriptors from application memory to gather useful metadata, such as where are Tx/Rx data buffers located, how long they are, etc. It also sometimes writes to these descriptors, for example to communicate Tx/Rx timestamps to the application.

# The issue

For now I'm simply trying to initialize the ETH interface correctly, and send one frame. However, upon activation of the ETH's DMA subunit, the ETH immediately throws an interrupt. By looking into the ETH's DMACSR register, I see the cause of the interrupt is a *Fatal Bus Error* during descriptor read by the ETH's DMA.

I believe I correctly completed all the initialization steps for each ETH subunit (as described in the [reference manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00314099-stm32h742-stm32h743753-and-stm32h750-value-line-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf), p. 2870 ""Ethernet Programming Model""). I also configured pin multiplexing in order to select the RMII MAC-PHY interface and enabled the GPIO and ETH clocks.

# What I tried

## Making sure descriptors are in memory accessible by the ETH

I first checked if the descriptors in application memory could be accessed by the ETH interface. At first they were in SRAM4, which I wasn't sure could be accessed by the ETH, so I moved them to SRAM2, which looks like it should be accessible by the ETH according to the diagram on page 104 of the reference manual. This did not solve my issue.

## Attributes of descriptor memory

I then stumbled upon this [post](https://community.st.com/s/article/FAQ-Ethernet-not-working-on-STM32H7x3) on the ST Community website, suggesting that descriptor memory should be set by the MPU as ""Device memory"" or ""Strongly-ordered memory"" (my understanding is that this prevents reordering memory accesses which could end up causing issues with Software&lt;-&gt;ETH communication done through descriptors). The post also suggests following the MPU configuration in one of the STM32Cube examples (the file is attached to the post).

I tried this example's MPU configuration, while making sure descriptors are in SRAM2, but this did not solve my issue either.

Did you ever run into that kind of problem? Am I missing anything?

Thanks."

but anyways... before I even step into college I always had this grand vision in my mind and I'm not exactly where I'm at... I'm currently in my junior of engineering and possibly landing the biggest internship of my life AMD/Intel before i intern at TI, Oracle and Magic Leap... but the thing is extremely set back in my school ""credit"" but I seem to excel from the work I do and getting re-offer from the same company but for some reason i cannot focus on getting my degree even tho I work closely with programing/hardware application... thats my first problem is that what do I DO? drop out and just work or finish it and chill on the internship...

second question is that i have recently realize that some of my childhood friends doesn't  align with my goal ... and im in this weird state where IM trying so fucking hard in my life to apply everything i can that i learn from engineering to innovate a new product or push a new idea or way of thinking into the world... For example "" Yes Theory"" was my inspiration when I first saw them on youtube it spark this fire under me to help anyone in any possibility ! anyways what im trying to say is that i just don't know what to do with the people around me because i truly love them and think that they all have their strong suit whether its EQ IQ or SQ but our goals are so different to the point where is monetary value, money  and ""women"" come in between us... im so content with one girl that hold me down for the rest of my life ( even tho im young and havent found the right one to commit to but that beside the point) and my friends are about ""bitches"", flashy car, flexing (and so on)... im honestly never been so confuse and not know what to do or what next for my life....

2) I can’t really apply for college internships since I’m not 18, and won’t be unless I go into grad school.

A start up company reached out to ask if I wanted to join their company part time as an Engineer whilst I am in Uni. The job offer is to work mainly in React and use MongoDB  and AWS from time to time. The only issue is, I've never used some of these technologies before  - I've used AWS for a lot of ML and Data Science Jobs in the past but that's it. 

Now the thing is, I am happy to work as their part-time engineer. It usually doesn't take me long to learn/adjust to a new language/technology. I worked as a Data Science intern straight out of high-school  (I took a gap year)  with an intermediate grip on Python and HTML; after the first few weeks I was up to speed and working on the same projects as my co-workers in the team. Which is why I feel not knowing React much shouldn't be so much of a problem.

Of course I am obliged to tell them this issue, but I'm not sure how to phrase it because this is a cool job I would like to take part in.

Do I tell them I would like to join and then explain I don't have the full skillset they are looking for but willing to get up to speed independently?"

m4g8kh,10,2021-03-13,Advice for a recent Applied Math Ph.D. who wants to be a Quant Researcher,EnxQ,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/m4g8kh/advice_for_a_recent_applied_math_phd_who_wants_to/,"TLDR I want to leave academia for a Quant Researcher role and I need advice.

Details: last year I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics just as the pandemic was rolling out. Due to the global uncertainty, I immediately took up a postdoctoral job offer at a large public University to be safe - but less than a year in, I now find myself counting the days until I can leave (small handful of months to go) - it feels like academia really isn't for me.

I have no experience in the financial world but I'm considering this world for my next career. I'm looking at starting to apply sometime in the next month. Before the Ph.D. I had an engineering bachelors degree, a number of years of programming experience (between undergrad and grad school) followed by a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. To clarify, none of my education involved machine learning, data sciences or financial modeling. My Ph.D. was related to numerical methods for partial differential equations (think about ""advanced calculus"") which describe how fluids behave, and so I have no expectations to use anything directly related to my dissertation in the finance world (at least yet. There are few connections but I don't want to digress here). I'm a pretty fast learner and I have an adaptive and resilient personality.

I have seen only few quant researcher ads for Math and Applied Math Ph.D.s that have no finance background. I would prefer to remain / work in NYC so among these, I'm most interested in Quant Research roles at Jane street, Point 72 (Cubist) and PDT Partners.

In particular, I'm a bit concerned about the following points:
(1) my mental ""arithmetic"" skills may not be as keen as they used to be - but I'm not sure if Job interviews have this same expectation from advanced degree holders (as they do with interns and fresh bachelor grads) - my mind just isn't really wired to do mental arithmetic anymore.
(2) How much of a factor does age-ism really play behind the scenes in this world? I'm 36 because as I said, I worked for some years before the Ph.D. However I get along pretty well with anyone and unless you already knew, I look like I'm in my mid 20s.
(3) My Ph.D. and postdoc supervisors would prefer me to remain in academia so I don't expect to get good reference letters from them. This may be a major problem if the job applications lean heavily on references.
(4) Also, even though the job ads mention no need for a finance background I feel like it will be in my best interests to acquire some background before I interview, so I can ask the interviewer some relevant questions. I'm not sure exactly where to break into the topics, so any pointers will be great, and I'll do my research.

Any advice you may have for me will be most welcome, especially if you were ever in my shoes. Thank you in advance."

This semester however I am taking Phys 140/141(general physics), math 116(calc 2), and ENGR 101(coding class, c++ and Matlab). I recently dropped Econ 101 so I could focus more on math and physics and build my knowledge in the areas so when I take future classes I feel more comfortable. My current GPA is 3.39, and I'm guessing it would be around the same at the end of this semester. I'm worried however that because I dropped econ 101, and have a ""W"" on my unofficial transcript it will look bad for when I apply for internships. I mainly want to apply next year or the start of my junior year for some defense companies, such as BAE Systems, General Dynamics, or Raytheon. How will this affect me? Has any engineering student been asked about a ""W"" on their unofficial transcript when applying to such/type of companies? ( ik bc of covid it won't appear on my official transcript, but most of these companies have you upload your transcript and usually ask for an official if they're interested). I plan to take summer classes, about 6 credits, so I can retake econ 101 in the summer since it's a required elective for mechanical engineering, also side question(should I take these classes at a cc or at umich, does that have any effect on how '""credible"" it is, I'm considering the cc option because its cheaper and it transfers, but bc I dropped econ at umich I'm not sure on what to do."

I’ve always known I am a loser, since my childhood, I tried to appeal to people and nothing seemed to work. I figured early on that a fat kid isn’t an attractive kid to hang out with, I am not cool, no girl or guy would befriend me. I’ve never accepted this though, I’ve always judged people, and I’ve always known I am better than some, definitely, I am.   
It is until highschool that I figured, I am good with Maths and Physics, let me capitalize on this, I explained complex problems to the cool kids to be friends with them. It worked.  
In my graduation year, I changed schools, and in one year everyone knew me, I became THE funny and smart kid. Everybody came to me to explain to them stuff. I liked it. For once I am on top of the world.   
Don’t get me wrong I like giving, I liked it so much, helping some of my colleagues getting through high school and scoring better grades or understanding something that bothered them for so long. I enjoyed it so much.   
Summer came, everybody graduated, I am useless now.   
They go to the beach, no one bothers to invite me. They go out, no one picks the phone to call. I was sitting in my room. Alone. Watching Instagram stories of my friends enjoying their time together. I sucked it all up. We would rarely meet, and when we do, I would treat them as if nothing happened. I loved them, so much, but it hurt so bad. 

Anyway, I was happy I got accepted into my dream school, which will soon turn out to be a disaster. I was always aiming to get into what I thought to be the top engineering school in my country. It was tough getting into it. I thought that I would be studying with the smartest students of my country and that the teachers are going to be the best of the best, and that they would come and pour their knowledge onto us. I literally believed that there would be good teachers, who will value us, me at least. I came with the mentality of wanting to learn. After one week I was paranoid, I would fail the first year. I was terrified, all I could see and hear from the older students, is careful of this teacher he is resentful, that other teacher just give up on his subject you will never score well in it, you need to cheat to pass. Hell on the first day of school one of our teachers told us that 50% will fail (which is so not true). I was paranoid, scared shitless. This trauma repeated itself for 5 years.   
5 years of bad teachers, cheating professors, and useless subjects. I became bitter like hell. I tried being positive, I always cheered up my friends who were feeling down I always denied the negativity, only this year it caught me too. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t happy I was just in denial. I soon after getting into engineering school I figured I am not meant to be an engineer, I however pushed myself. I wanted to make my grandma and mom happy.   
This year I figured I will never be able to work in a technical field, it is just not for me.   
So I decided, if I am going to be sad or not passionate, I should at least earn good money while being sad ( in case you are confused I live in Morocco, big multinational companies come to my country to exploit engineers and workers and pay them low wages since most of the students are poor they pressure them to accept low salaries -400 USD a month in some cases-).  
I started preparing for the french equivalent of GMAT, to get into business schools and transition to finance, since I kinda like finance and entrepreneurship, and I like the proactivity of it.   
05 December was my exam day, I didn’t prep very well because in part I procrastinated a lot on it and because I suck at french, and a huge part of the exam was in french. Also, my grandma was being so sick, she lost consciousness, she was dying .. I couldn’t see her on her last daying, partly because of COVID but also because I was trying to prep for the exam in what was left in time. Long story short, on 05/December I went to a different city, did my exam, came back and was planning to see her, I was so sick though and had harsh migraines, I decided to sleep and go the next day, the next day I procrastinated all-day, until mom called and told me to come at my grandma’s she was being so sick. I was terrified, I was her favorite grandson, she was my favorite person in the whole world, she still is, I was doing all this to make her proud, I’ve taken the trauma and the stress for her.   
Moments after I arrived, I saw people sitting, I sat down next to her, and after a few minutes, a sudden sound was heard, It was the ventilator she was on, she died.   
I remember before when she was starting to fade, she had no energy to open her eyes or talk, she would be quiet even if my mom and my uncles are there, but when she heard my voice or my name she would fight to open her eyes move her hands and say hi to me, I will never forget it.   
December 5th I went to the cursed exam, on December the 6th she died. I scored horribly.   
I signed for a new session, I wasn’t giving up. I started studying very hard, I saw myself improve very much, I was taking my mind off my grandma and my depressed nihilistic ideas, I was keeping busy, only for the resentful teachers to show themselves.   
we were supposed to start our capstones and have exams at the same times, they decided to drag us with exams and courses until April ( for reference we are supposed to finish every exam by February and start our internships, some friends even heard teachers laugh at us and say mean things about us). I was fed up, my TAGE MAGE( the exam I m taking for business schools) is scheduled to be on the 20th of march, I lost close to a months worth of prep I feel like I lost all the skills I gained, I m back at square one, I will score horribly again.   
I am going to fail, again. My score won’t get me into a top school, and I can’t have my parents pay so much money for me to be a failure.   
I wasn’t with my favorite person in the world in her last days just so I would fail.   
I hate the person I’ve become, I don’t see a point in living anymore, I now can’t even focus for 15 mins, my brain is fucked, I am so dysfunctional and useless.   
I am a driveless, goalless, and pessimistic 23-year-old engineering student who absolutely hates what he studies.   
I just want to give up, but I can’t."

* In my late-20's, graduated from the CS Online program at CSU Monterey Bay in August 2020, and I have an AS in Computer Science at Cuesta College.
* Ideally, would develop video games and self-publish them as a career. I'm aware this isn't particularly feasible, though.
* No job experience, just volunteer work at humane societies years ago.
* Didn't make any worthwhile projects on the side while in school. Currently, I'm trying to come up with projects to put on GitHub.
* On the autism spectrum, high-functioning. I'm often prone to sensory overload, but it's improved greatly. I also don't live independently, and I rely on subsidized income.
* Dealing with poor self-esteem and lack of confidence. Anxiety and depression can often be very overwhelming. I am medicated, though.
* Although I worked with a great group throughout my university program, I prefer working alone. I feel like I think and work too slowly no matter how hard I try, which raises my anxiety immensely. Generally, I'm not a very social person.
* I enjoy programming and learning about data structures. That was my favorite part. Databases never really clicked for me, but maybe that could change.
* Proficient in Java, actively learning C++ and sometimes Python. Working on a text-based adventure game in C++. I'm also learning to develop C++ projects in Unreal.
* I believe my greatest strength is perseverance even when things feel utterly hopeless. I'm often told that I'm logical and creative, even though I don't really see it. My grades were good, but not amazing.
* This is slightly off-subject, but it's important to me: I've been in a long-distance relationship for several years, and we've visited many times. She lives in Ontario, Canada, I live in California. We badly want to live together and marry. She doesn't have her own place yet, either.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the details are excessive or too personal. I just want to paint a clear picture before I ask the following:

1. Do you have any ideas for what kind of job positions I should seek? If I can avoid unpaid internships, that'd be preferable, but I understand if that's not feasible. Remote is preferred, even if the pandemic passes.
2. What do you suggest for someone who isn't comfortable working in groups? How can I improve? Can I do something more independent?
3. How should I go about making a portfolio? Would it be worthwhile to make my own website with some nice CSS or just stick with GitHub?
4. After covid-related restrictions can be lifted (hopefully), I want to move to Ontario with my girlfriend. Could a tech position somehow ease the immigration process?

&amp;#x200B;

I know this post is long, but I thank you very much for your time. Please let me know if this violates the subreddit rules in any way, sometimes I miss very obvious details. I'll try to answer any questions.

EDIT: Thanks for your thoughtful feedback. It looks like I'm on the right track, I just need to take any position I can and see where it leads me. The prospect of neurodiversity hiring is especially interesting, though I understand how joining a sporting team would magically solve all my problems."

I went through a major transitionary period in my life near the end of college through the last couple years which caused mental health issues, including bipolar II, body dysmorphia, and agoraphobia, to appear or worsen. I lost all hope and went through multiple suicide attempts, leading me to completely stop developing my personal and professional skills, ignore my health, and rack up lots of debt I thought my six-feet-under self was never going to have to pay back. Anyway, I'm seeking advice now rather than pity.

I'm 23, a few months from 24. I rarely feel like it because my social skills are shot compared to most my age, though I'm fortunate enough to have a group of friends who've stuck with me. I have been unemployed since summer/fall 2018 and finished my BA in 2019. My work experience currently consists of retail work, no more than 6 months at a time.

My degree is in the humanities (Linguistics). I began losing passion for it halfway through college...and it's not that marketable a degree in the first place, but I finished it figuring I could land some nondescript job that wanted any type of degree. I never successfully found any internships, etc. during school. Between this and losing quite a lot of time to video games I used as a coping mechanism for my budding mental issues as a teen/student, I lost a lot of personal development time, and what few connections and references I ever had.

I'm in five figures of credit card debt due to mostly luxury/entertainment purchases. I do not have student debt. I like to think I was pretty financially literate and had a medium-high credit score for a while. When I decided to try and end my life is when I figured all of that ceased to matter and my debt increased while my credit score tanked from high usage and missed payments over the last year. 

My lack of life and professional experience at my age makes me feel like I'm starting from scratch here and it's so daunting. I'm trying to make plans for the future but I need guidance on how to find the motivation and path to do it all.

I somehow hit a point recently where I finally decided it was time to seek treatment for my illnesses, so I've been seeing a psychiatrist for a month and a half. I've been diagnosed and started a mood stabilizer, though the dose is not yet high enough to see any effects. I'm still unhappy and don't necessarily *want* to continue living, but I don't think I'm able to completely give up. My first appointment with a cognitive behavioral therapist is on Monday, who I hope helps me push through my apparently inability to make decisions and better myself, as well as the crippling self image issues that prevent me from leaving the house let alone getting out of bed many days.

Career-wise, I'm currently trying to put my resume back in order, however sparse it is and find a basic wage job (more retail, etc.) to occupy my time and start rebuilding professional connections before I move on to higher level work. I'm not sure if this is the right move or not compared to trying to find an entry level but more career-type position like an administrative assistant, etc., but I don't feel capable of that yet. I also have this idea that I'd like to pursue IT as a career by starting to work through basic certifications (A+, Network, Security, MCSE...?) on the side and work my way through that ladder. I think I need to consult with a more specific community and friends who work in that field, though.

I have the ability to fully pay off my debts by withdrawing a portion of a trust I inherited in 2020, and I think that (and cutting up excess credit cards) is the right play rather than trying to work the debt and ever-accumulating interest off with what low wage employment I hopefully soon find. My parents are still supporting me in terms of housing/insurance/phone/car at the moment, though their patience is understandably wearing thin. I recognize the privilege I have here.

This is probably the longest-form reddit post I've ever written, so if you slogged through this and can relate or have any advice for someone like me trying to get back on their feet (or on their feet in the first place), I would really sincerely appreciate hearing from you. Thank you!"

Hope it can be helpful for some people. 

I got my BA and MS in STEMs in U.S top50 colleges, and graduated during the pandemic. My major is CS related, but not a CS degree and did not have a CS internship. I applied about 200-300 positions which require 1-3 years of experiences. And I got 15 interviews and 4 offers. My base salary is about 90k-100k in HCOL (not VHCOL).

So here is my 2 cents. 

1) The quality of resume is very important. You need to focus on key words for each position you applied.

2) It is necessary to include one big and outstanding project, and know how to explain them clearly.

3) Try to connect with people directly to apply for the position, and get references.

4) Practice some LC questions. It is necessary to know some data structures and algorithm for most entry level jobs."

I have a decent knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, MongoDB. I am also a fast learner. I have been really struggling and wasted an entire year just doing nothing due to some issues like I was aiming for greatness that I would get a 60k job directly lol. Then I thought let's fuck it. I stopped learning and stopped applying and started wasting time on the internet all day. A year passed by. It was later that I realized I made a big mistake. Regret is still there because my life has been nothing but a total failure.

That's why I'm now looking for internships urgently and maybe fresher roles. Even if the pay is less, I'll take it as it's better to do something than nothing. Let me know if you have any questions. I will send details in DM if you have any queries.

m4r08c,1,2021-03-14,How do I get out of this job and fulfill my dream to become a web developer?,Bulbous-Bouffant,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/m4r08c/how_do_i_get_out_of_this_job_and_fulfill_my_dream/," **TL;DR** \- I don't like my job and it doesn't pay much. I have B.S. degree in Software with very little web development experience, but it's all I want to do and I want to do it remotely.

I'm in my late 20s, married with two kids, and have a B.S. in Software Development, and I live in Oregon in a pretty techy area. While being a stay-at-home dad for 3 1/2 years, I got this degree online (at an accredited uni) in about 2 1/2 years during that time. Currently, my wife and I both work, and it's the only way we can afford to live without receiving help from her parents again (no thanks).

I'm tired of my job. I couldn't find a programming job out of college due to lack of industry experience (no internships either), so after running into an old family friend while job searching for six months, I decided to accept a newly opened position he had as a field technician in the energy-efficiency industry. I knew from the beginning that this job wasn't for me, but I was just ready to work anything that paid a decent enough wage, plus it's a short drive from home and has great benefits, which we need. I really gave it my all for the first few months. I grew to love the company and the people in it, but the job *just isn't for me*. I hate traveling. I hate going into homes and businesses, crawling into attics and crawlspaces, and telling people how they can save energy. It's not my thing.

But I did get a little lucky on this job. They just happened to have a minor ""web development"" project that was going nowhere when I first joined. Hungry to put my degree to use, I told them I'd take lead on it whenever I had the time, despite it not being a part of my job description. Well, COVID happened and I had much more time than I anticipated, so I absolutely rolled with the project. Since then, I have taken it to new heights by implementing HTML and CSS into it to make it look and feel way better than anyone else in the company could have done. My job has since become half field tech, half web developer, although extraneous circumstances in the company very often take me away from developing more and going back to doing what I hate doing.

For the past few months, I have written essays and had meetings with management to request raises, a title change, and an office. They consistently praise me for my work and tell me how valuable I have become to the company. By now, they know how badly I don't want to be a field tech, but they frankly just don't have the means to replace me in this position and make a brand new position for me in the near future. Getting a big taste on my very own web dev project has left me so hungry for more. **More than ever now, I just want to work remotely full-time as a web developer**. This small company can't give me what I want... at least not for a long time. I am pulling my hair out working this job and not doing what I want to do at a salary that I feel I deserve. 

**So why don't I just look for a web development job?**

Well, that's where I'm struggling. While I now have real-world experience as a web developer, that experience is minimal. I have only used HTML and CSS, so no JS or frameworks, etc. Totally vanilla. While I believe I have a knack for it, I still only know the basics. I am now at a point where I want to do everything that I possibly can to strengthen my resume and add to the little industry experience I've gotten. I really just don't know where to start. Before I got this job, I developed my own resume website from scratch with HTML and CSS. My initial thought is to get that back online and start implementing javascript to improve it. I still just don't feel like it's enough.

**My ultimate goal is this:**

I want to work for a company as a web developer remotely getting paid at least 60k/year with benefits. I also want to eventually freelance to gain extra income and hopefully someday make enough so that my wife no longer has to work and can be a stay-at-home mom, which is something she really wants.

Where do I go from here?"

m4r93n,5,2021-03-14,How much will doing poorly at an internship affect my career?,ComprehensiveStress5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m4r93n/how_much_will_doing_poorly_at_an_internship/,"I've been working at an internship at a moderately sized/well known company for almost a year (they extended me longer than my original contract). I was doing well at first but the covid fatigue has really set in and I'm really struggling to complete the work expected of me. Until now I've gotten positive reviews (they extended me so that must mean something) but I'm beginning to feel like I won't be able to catch up on some things on time and I'm scared of getting reprimanded by manager. I'm worried it might look like I've been slacking, which I have a bit but I mostly just can't focus the way I used to and am hitting a wall when it comes to being in my bedroom 24/7 (I live with roommates in a city essentially in lockdown, not able to see my family for months).

The anxiety of potentially getting in trouble is getting to the point where I fantasize about quitting. I feel ungrateful since I have this opportunity during this difficult time and I'm not able to make the most of/appreciate it. I also have existing mental health issues that are normally ""high functioning"" as in I suffer but other people can't tell for the most part and my work isn't greatly affected, but covid and wfh have put me in a bad place.  Even though I'm not enjoying the work and would prefer to work somewhere else when I graduate I'm also afraid of the job market during/after covid and don't want to burn bridges. I have other internships but they were several years ago because I jumped around majors and took some time off at one point so I also want to have a reference from this job if not an offer, especially after working there so long. I only have 1 more term of school after this.

I guess my question is how do I navigate doing badly at work? Should I share with my manager that I'm struggling with my mental health? How much will it affect my ability to get a job after this if I don't get a reference?"

I just had my internship at an avg size company (2k employees) in a Business Intelligence team. When asking around my colleagues whether I should pursue a master for my future Data Scientist/Engineer path I received quite a diverse mix of response. Some said degree doesnt weigh as much as experience, and I should only seek for a master degree when I find it hard to have a job offer, while some said master are some what expected for an engineer regardless of fields.

Personal: I'm a 28 yr old Male from Brazil and without rights to any EU citizenship (I have tried the Italian one but with no luck, so it's basically ruled out). I have lived in Germany for 18 months during my degree, so I'm able to speak German at B1\~B2 level and English at C1\~C2 level.

Why I want out? Life in Brazil is hard. I'm 28 years old and still need financial support from my parents (who won't be here forever): salaries, safety and quality of life are low and only worsening year after year.

What I have thought: doing a master's degree in Germany since I already have experience in the country. Why am I not so sure?

1. I have read that it's not so easy to find a job in the country when you're not from the EU, even if you have a local degree. And there are no visa incentives after you graduate, if you don't find a job you basically need to go back to your country.
2. Unfortunately,  I can't afford it financially. Even though the universities are tuition free (usually), the visa requirements are pretty strict (around 10.000 euros/ year in a blocked account). There are no scholarships in my field.

I'm reaching out to you guys because I really need advises on this path. I want to go to Europe because the quality of life and opportunities are way higher than in Brazil. But, at the same time, I'm not sure about which country. Am I missing any opportunity?"
m4vn1g,0,2021-03-14,Profile evaluation (Robotics),zeartful2,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/m4vn1g/profile_evaluation_robotics/,"Hi everyone I'm looking to apply for a PhD for Fall 2022 in the field of robotics (looking into SLAM, aerial robotics or drone swarms). Sorry for the long post, but I feel it might be more insightful for an outside perspective to evaluate my profile than myself. I am mainly worried about my research experience.

I did a summer research internship my second summer at a different university for about 2 months and also did research my senior year. However, I didn't get any publication or anything close. My summer research I did my own experiments but did not result in anything due to the short duration and my senior year research just kind of blurred away due to covid. Regardless of covid I did not feel like I was contributing something meaningful during thr senior research as mostly I was helping out a grad student rather than exploring on my own. All in all I have maybe a year of research and I am looking to offset this lack of extensive research by trying to appeal my want to research through my senior year competition where my team was nominated as finalists and invited to a forum for a presentation and also through a competition based grad level course. I understand it is not exactly research experience per say, but I am trying to work with what I got.

I am currently serving in the military (S.Korea) and it has proven rather difficult to conduct relevant research in the meantime as much as I had hoped to, so that is all the research experience I will have by then. 

Other than that here are my other stats:
School: Graduated UT Austin 2020
Major: Aerospace engineering with a computational engineering certificate
GPA: 3.82 cumulative 3.88 major gpa
GRE: did not take yet
LoR: 1 from my senior research professor, 1 from the grad school level course professor that suggested I go to grad school, and 1 from the senior competition advisor/professor. I asked these three over the summer internship as I feel I have a much closer relationship and hence write much deeper LoRs. 

Currently the dream programs/labs are at UMich and Harvard which are both extremely competitive. Obviously anyone would want to get into their dream schools and I know it is impossible to predict it, but I wanted to know how I stand in perspective of other people. I will be honest I keep trying to make excuses as to how I might or not have a chance and I am looking for more input to guage where to apply.

Thanks to anyone who read through for your time! :)"

How important is doing something before freshman year? I've been trying to find an internship but it seems basically impossible. Research is a little more promising, but I haven't had any luck with that either.

m4xeev,5,2021-03-14,(Probably) applying to Columbia computer science ED - please give me some advice!,An_ambitious_guitar,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/m4xeev/probably_applying_to_columbia_computer_science_ed/,"Hi guys! This is my first time posting on Reddit :D

I was just browsing Reddit and researching college application advice and stuff, and now I'm worried about my application. I'm a junior international student rn, and I really really want to get into Columbia computer science. The thing is, I really AM interested in computer science, but I just feel like there's nothing much to talk about it in my application. I also think my depth of knowledge in CS is really shallow, compared to other CS students who got accepted in competitive schools. Well, I thought I just needed basic knowledge about the field, just follow what my school teaches me (I'm taking IB classes btw) and when I get to college, I can actually learn much more. I don't see the point of learning extensively when you're gonna do all of that in college. But now I see other students doing internships at professional companies, which I assume you do need deep understanding and knowledge of CS, tons of hackathons, winning national coding challenges and stuff. The only stuff I can list related to CS is:

&amp;#x200B;

Take IB computer science HL (Ik this isn't an EC)

1st place at a small online hackathon

I'm in the student ambassador technology team for a small company 

Technology hub leader for a service project

Possibly a CS related research paper for Pioneer academics (I'm in the application process)

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should still invest(?) in computer science by doing things such as:

&amp;#x200B;

Take high-level online courses in EdX, Coursea, etc

Do more hackathons

Or other stuff? (please do recommend!)

&amp;#x200B;

The only concern is that the IB curriculum is just too rigorous, and I'm worried that I won't have enough time to do ECs related to computer science. 

I know that essays are a huge part of the application, so is it possible to get into top schools like Columbia with a computer science major with my current ECs if I write excellent essays, get good grades, good SAT scores, etc? (I do have other ECs, these are just the ones related to computer science)"
m4yegw,6,2021-03-14,Tips on how to get a blockchain-related job in the US as a UK new grad,ImmanuelK2000,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/m4yegw/tips_on_how_to_get_a_blockchainrelated_job_in_the/,"As the title suggests, I am currently a (final year) CS student at a good uni in the UK, but I would really like to leave this awful climate (both in terms of geography and politics) and move to CA/WA for a while at least. I have done a few internships with financial companies, as well as currently working part time for a medium sized tech company (web dev role though) while finishing up my final year. In terms of academic achievements, I expect to graduate with a First (it is usually equivalent to a GPA of 3.5+).

My main interest is blockchain technology, and I am currently building a new platform (in a way an extension to Augur-REP, for the crypto enthusiasts) for my bachelor's thesis. Due to this, I am looking to continue working in this field after graduation.

My question is mainly directed to either people who were in a similar situation or people who are currently working in a blockchain-related role that might have some insights into how getting a position in this space as a foreigner works. What I am interested in finding out are essentially good ways of going about getting a role in this field before moving to the US (might be worth mentioning that I have already spent a summer in CA on a student visa at the end of my first year of uni, although it was in a non-tech position). 

I am currently planning on applying to large companies in this space for roles in their US offices, although I do not expect this to yield great results. Any better ideas are greatly appreciated.

Thank you all in advance.

m4zai9,1,2021-03-14,Applying for a job at a place I interned for?,kbre15,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/m4zai9/applying_for_a_job_at_a_place_i_interned_for/,"Hi everyone! 

TDLR: I’m having trouble writing a cover letter for a job that I intern for. A large portion of my cover letter is about this internship, do I need to change that? How do I do tailor it?

Back story:
September 2019 I started an internship at an organization, it started as a 3 month internship but I ended up staying a full year wrapping up in September 2020. I had spoken with them about possibly hiring me permanently/full time last summer before the end of my internship but they’re a smaller organization and weren’t able to bring me on. I want to emphasize that no one else has been hired in the time since then. 

Cut to last week, one of the two people who I directly reported to and worked with for the year has left the organization and their job is open. I’d obviously like to apply when the job is posted but I’m stuck on how to apply. This was a major internship and is featured on my resume and cover letter. Everything I say about my role in both is accurate, they helped me write and describe my position for them before I left. 

My question is, how much do you think I need to adjust my cover letter? Right now it’s meant for other organizations so I’m not sure how to tailor it for an organization I already work for, especially so recently.

Secondary questions: Should I skip waiting for the job to be posted and just email them? If I wait till the job is posted should I email it to my direct contact or go through the publicized channel? Anything else that would be worth doing? Never done this before!

Thanks in advance!"

m51dz9,9,2021-03-14,How do I escape this hell?,ghostshelltaken,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/m51dz9/how_do_i_escape_this_hell/,"For context I'm 22 years old guy and in past 3 years I tried to end my life 2 times.

My family is quite religious family. Like crazy KAREN religious, wouldn't listen to facts. I have been physically abused in childhood. They used to hit me crazy for no apparent major reason. 

Since I was 10 years old, I was sent to religious school full time, only spent couple of months home since then. Next 7 years, I spend learning about religion. Only thing I learned is untimely religion wants you to believe in humanity and I became an atheist. Believing in people rather then religion. I was one of the top student in my state. 

When I turned 18, I got into good college. I was ready to take on and wanted to make some difference. But since that point, My parents started to make decisions that were just too absurd (decisions which were religious based that had no meaningful outcomes). They took me out of college clubs. They called NGOs and told some stories to get me out of those. I had a part time job which was as expected taken away. I wasn't allowed to experience internships. Any life related lesson I chose to do, was taken away. Any friend I make, they do something that either they stop being my friend or I had to stop being their friend.

All of these things led me to stand up for myself. I choose to fight for the things. I chose to fight the establishment that I was raised upon which is as expected effected my academics and also some debt which is not much issue. That's no excuse, but I didn't knew better. 

There isn't a single person who knows me, real me. There isn't a person I can talk about this feeling. I tried to end my life 2 times, in frustration and no one knows about this. For past some time I'm having same thoughts.

How do I escape this hell?"
m52tl5,1,2021-03-14,Is it normal to not fully understand my colleague's code?,Teabx,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/m52tl5/is_it_normal_to_not_fully_understand_my/,"Greetings everyone.

I want to get it out of the way first, I am currently a third year Computer Engineering student and I happened to find a part time job at a local company (my first real job in this field). I was hired as a Junior Developer but to be honest, at the moment it feels more like a paid internship because they specified that throughout the first month they want me to get familiar with their technologies (and so far they haven't given me any difficult tasks).

The company mostly works on web-related stuff and that's where I am giving my contribution as well. I have been working on simple front-end stuff so far, but lately I expressed the desire to jump onto the back end, as I enjoy that part more and I have a little more experience from my personal smaller projects that I have worked with my friends.

The team leader gave me access to some of their older projects in github and told me to have a look at the code and tell him if it seems okay or not. I started looking at the code and honestly I started to get a little worried because there were parts of it that I couldn't understand. (they used firebase for the backend, which I haven't used before, but honestly that wasn't the problem as the firebase functions were fairly straightforward to understand).

I do have some experience with backend, as I previously mentioned, and I could see what the code was trying to accomplish, so the *how?* wasn't much of a problem. The problem was more with the *why?.*

For example, I couldn't figure out why some of the seemingly unrelated database entries were being updated on a function which was supposed to simply create a new reservation.

Is this normal, or am I just unprepared for real professional work at this stage of my career? Or is it a case of just panicking for no reason, and stuff will just come naturally as I continue working on actual projects.

Thank you in advance for your time."

The rest is all background to give you an idea of my situation. Thanks in advance for any kind of advice!

I have a bachelors in corporate communication but fell into an inside sales job out of college. I hate sales but I bust my ass every day and moved from regular inside sales to a more specialized division of it within the same company, before ultimately being promoted to a software sales consultant position with a 'start up' department within, again, the same company.

Because of my success and personality, I was chosen to help get this new software department off the ground. It started as just me and my manager. We eventually hired two more people, both supposed to be sales people who would basically be under me, while I was to be moved to project manager and out of sales.

Surprise, surprise, one of the new hires is now being groomed to be project manager and I'm staying in my current role, with the country being split between myself and the other sales person. I was told I was too important to the sales process to move out of that role and that the project manager role would be more about doing admin stuff, like power points, microsoft teams posts, internal presentations, etc. which I've repeatedly expressed as wanting to do.

So I'm being punished for doing my job well. I get paid $18.50 an hour and get $20-$50 per sale which isn't a lot considering as a start up, we only have 4-5 products and I make 3-5 sales per week. My official title is software sales consultant and each sale tends to be a 3-4 week process that I have to walk the office through.

I'm over my cheap ass company, I'm over my lying ass boss, and I want to get the out of sales. I hate that my fate and income is determined by whether someone else wants to buy my shit or not, with quotas and goals. It makes me feel grimy and I get anxiety and cringe when I hear myself selling a product to a customer like some greasy used car salesman. I take no joy in selling someone something, it's more of a relief that it's one less sale I need to make to reach my quota. I'm much more comfortable with a deadline or something that I can personally take responsibility for and have full control over to get done. I hate directly manipulating people to trick them into being convinced that my product is better than something else, when in all honesty, it's all the exact same, or they might not need it to begin with. It really sucks and I hate being looked at by customers, friends, and family, as a salesman.

In my current role, I was put in charge of the onboarding process for both new employees, but I'm pretty sure they make more than me at base salary. I love leading and feel comfortable in a role like that, as I've done so my entire life. From basketball and football, to group projects in school, to the work place. I've been making an effort to show my boss that I'm capable of taking on a manager roll by taking on extra projects, working off of the clock with no pay and only logging 40hrs a week because no overtime is offered to ensure things are done (boss knows and say's he ""appreciates it""), and taking it upon myself to spread awareness throughout the company by scheduling presentation that I give during regional sales meetings and making weekly posts about the products we sell because we rely on leads from the outside sales reps to make our sales.

I just feel trapped right now because I've been looking for jobs and I don't qualify for anything other than direct sales positions. Anything outside of straight up sales I never hear back.

I love being creative, problem solving, and working with my hands. I had an internship with the office of strategic communications at my college and loved it. Working on press releases, feature stories, coordinating fundraisers, creating ads, programs, and flyers. Shit was dope. Especially working on new and innovative ways to promote things. I've also had some experience with house building and working in construction as I helped my dad build an add-on garage to our house before everything was destroyed by a hurricane. I then helped gut and work on a lot of the house in the rebuilding process as contractors were flakey as fuck because they took on too many rebuild jobs than they could handle.

Does anyone have any idea about a way out of a sales position considering my corporate communication degree, experience, and interests? I can't really afford to take a pay cut as $18.50 is already dog shit considering all the work I'm doing. I have been applying for product manager and project manager jobs but don't even get a reply with the experience I have. I was told a corporate communication degree recommends public relations related jobs, HR, and jobs with non-profit organizations. But any applications to those also never get answered, hence I took the sales role two years ago. I've been actively looking for jobs for almost four years now that isn't a sales job and can't get anything. Currently live in PA but will be relocating to Tampa FL in June for my wife's job. My job is currently 100% remote so I have the option to keep my job for the move. I just hate being a salesman so much that it's affecting my psyche and my general mental health. Thanks for any kind of advice on what to do or where to look."
m53v45,1,2021-03-14,Help with Correlation Analysis in Python,LearningDataEveryday,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/m53v45/help_with_correlation_analysis_in_python/,"Hi,
I have some data I want to perform Correlation Analysis on. So far I know there are obviously threw methods, 1. Pearson 2. Spearman 3. Kendall's tau.

Now, some resources say that to use Pearson, your data must be linear and normally distributed, otherwise the correlations could be misleading. But I thought Pearson is used to check the linearity between the variables? So do I really need to check if my data is linear or normally distributed? If so, do I get if they are linear by just plotting a graph? Or is there more analysis required?

Spearman needs the data to be ordinal or ranked. Now, if my data has 0,1,2..n (mostly integers) as values in almost all columns and 0,1 in some, then do I need to assign ranks explicitly?

Kendall's is supposed to work on ranked data too, I read. 

Which one should I use? And if I use all 3, how to determine which one to consider? Because the Pearson and Spearman correlation values are very different from each other.

Please help, I'm using this in my internship project."

I'm an international student, currently a junior double majoring in CS and Mathematics with emphasis on CS at a tier 3 or just a normal state college. Being all away from my family, living alone with my own place, freshman year was just 365 days of exploration into the new world and I finished with a gpa of 2.9. Depression hit my third semester which resulted in 2 Ds and 1 E in a single semester. I've been trying hard since then and currently now I'm with 3.2 and hoping to graduate with around 3.3-3.4. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, I have nothing to boast on my resume. I have 0 side projects and 0 internship or any sort of job experience. I will try to apply for internships over the summer but it looks like the chances are pretty low. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wow writing down everything really let me see the reality. 

What could I do from now?

What could I do to improve myself in the next 12 months and get a job in the states with a visa sponsorship? (As a foreigner, I need a working visa)."

I applied to Jane Streets Quant Trading internship in 2019. Had four phone interviews and then the oniste with 4 interviews. 1&amp;2 went well, the third was medium but the fourth onsite interview was dreadful. Needless to say I got rejected.

Then come the 2020 intake and I applied to the internship again and this time I wasn't even given a first phone interview.

Little background about me: Truly love mathematics and statistics. From the UK third year student now so first applied when 18. Now 21. Genuinely want JS for the ""right reasons"" I liked my time in their office ,liked my interviewers and questions asked, think I would enjoy the work. Now this might seem pathetic but the Jane street onsite was the first interview I ever had in my life. I enjoyed the first 3 very much I was calm and focused and had fun talking about nice maths but for the fourth I was a little intimidated by the interviewer, I found them a tad in-polite and I felt very nervous all of a sudden.

I believe that I got the instant rejection in 2020 because I hadn't really changed or grown or got more experience. However now I feel like, as Anakin said to Douku , ""my powers have doubled since the last time we met"" I've undergone my own research in mathematics, computing and statistics. I will hopefully have received my Bachelors and will be enrolled on a strong MFE. I have become a more confident person and as such the concept of interviews wont be as intimidating.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: I am on some sort of blacklist for Jane street? Will they ever consider me if I apply for a third time. (this time likely for the graduate position)  I know this seems desperate but I'm not a quitter. I am not attracted by the large salaries I just want a place to been very intellectually stimulated and did honestly like (most) of the people I met along the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much for reading all of this. Also if someone is currently going through the process I remember all (about 12 or so) questions I was asked during the 4 phone and 4 onsite interviews so would be MORE than happy to send this to you, just dm :)"

When I originally went to college, I struggled greatly and ended up flunking a majority of my classes. After working for a few years I started back at community college where I finished an Associate's Engineering degree with a 3.8.


After this, I returned to the same University I originally attended and thus far I have also earned a 3.8 there, although I have only finished one semester and summer classes. Since returning, I only have these grades but because I have completed a significant number of classes at community college I am essentially a junior who should be supplementing my resume with internships.


The problem is that my current GPA is being calculated with all of the classes I originally failed. Many of these classes I either passed at community college or were completely irrelevant to my current field of study. As a result I am currently sitting with a 2.3 and I am worried that I will not be considered for any positions with a GPA so low. 


Is there anyway to report my recent GPA without coming across as deceptive? Would saying something like ""my GPA has been a 3.8 since 2016"" be appropriate? Any general suggestions for how to handle this situation?


If I am given the opportunity to explain how my original struggles helped me grow as an individual in an interview I can put the situation in context, but I am really worried that with a GPA so low I won't get that chance.


Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I've been feeling a bit stuck lately. I am trying to do the right things to help myself progress, however I am not seeing any results. And I know things take time, but its frustrating and im feeling more anxious as time passes.

I currently live outside of NYC, but I am working in the city at a decent sized company. I started off at this company in late 2019 as an intern, and was promoted to IT Support Analyst late last year. While my time at this company has been great and Ive learned a lot, there really isnt any room for growth at this time (ive spoken to my manager about it) and Im not even making decent money (less than industry standard). So needless to say, the only thing keeping me at this place is the job experience and the fact that i have an income.

While its been cool to learn and gain some real experience, Im not really enjoying the IT Support work anymore. Ive been more interested in Cloud technology as well as InfoSec/Cyber/Risk&amp;Compliance work, and ive been trying to get more well versed in those areas through courses and certifications. But without any real world experience I am finding it tough to break into those fields. And so because of that, I am also applying to IT Support Analyst/Engineer roles as well (to at least get a boost in pay), but still not having much luck. Ive sent out a bunch of applications over the last couple months but have only had a couple of interviews that haven't lead to anything.

So with all that being said, is there anything I need to improve on my [resume](https://imgur.com/a/7NHPuiM)? I am thinking about studying for Sec+, is that a good next step or should I look into another cert/course? Aside from certs/courses, what else can I do to help myself stand out?

I'm currently a senior at a university in Chicago, studying Finance and Economics with a 3.7 GPA.

However, I am doing well academically and I have some research experience with valuation analysis, stock pitching, etc.

I want to work in investment banking, but I fear that it will be very tough to break in with no experience. Assuming that money is not an issue, would it be wise to go to graduate school, and if so, what kind of a degree would be best? I am thinking of an MSF or a degree in financial engineering, or possibly going for an MBA and trying to get recruited to internships and eventually full time employment in grad school.

Just curious if anyone has any ideas on what types of questions I should be asking other than languages, frameworks, hours I'll be working... Maybe that's all I'm supposed to ask? I'm not really sure how to gauge if a project is a good fit because I have so little experience.

Any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks everyone :)"

I’m graduating in May 2021 and I’m excited to have just received my first offer as an Associate Data Engineer for a company called EAB with two offices. My offer was 72k flat for the Richmond Office with great benefits (25 days PTO, etc). However, after doing more research I feel like the DC office would be a much better fit for me (much more social for a guy in his early 20s), but it looks according to Glassdoor the pay would only go up to 80k in a higher COL area.

I was wondering whether I should try to negotiate for the DC office and what kind of TC I should be aiming for. I have about 1 year of internship experience as a Data Science Intern and also have a competing offer as a Data Analyst in Boston, albeit for 75k."

2. I know Purdue has the CCO and the CS career fair, but how much does Purdue help in obtaining internships? I hope to have a few personal projects developed during my freshman year and get one by my sophomore summer, but I don't know if it'll be a numbers game or if Purdue will be significant in helping me obtain one.

3. What is it about Purdue specifically that makes it distinguished compared to a ""less competitive"" cs program like, dare I say, IU's CS program.

Always keep in mind that the resume is only one factor in the recruiting process so don't spend too much time trying to perfect it. Some things to keep in mind when tailoring your resume:

* Include keywords used in the job description. What skills are preferred? Try to incorporate it into your previous role descriptions.
* Use action verbs at the start of every sentence. What did you do? Words such as Lead, Performed, Collaborated are more powerful than Helped and Assisted.
* Keep your resume to one page, with a professional layout and font. What you write in the resume is more important than how fancy it looks.

Currently a 3rd year student studying Management CS at an Ivy League University (personally don't feel like this is relevant but since similar posts mention it, w/e). Recently switched into the program so have very few projects not to mention no professional work experience.

After about 150+ applications and few interviews 10+ (including phone screens), I've managed to get two offers for the summer;

1. An unpaid SWE Internship for a startup
2. Paid Business Dev Internship for a startup

Basically, I'm graduating in a year and a half and have no relevant work experience. My goal is to be a SWE so the SWE internship would look really nice on my resume, not to mention the priceless learning experience it could potentially give me.

On the other hand, I could go for the Business Development internship which is basically a glorified clerical role with maybe a small focus on Python (job description mentions nothing about Python but prefers it in ""Qualifications"").

I'm currently living at home so I have no immediate financial needs to meet, though the extra pay would be nice. But the biggest criticism I've read about unpaid internships (aside from the obvious) is the lack of proper structural mentorship that comes with them. Considering that the latter, being my main motivator for going for an unpaid internship, might not be present, just presents a gamble for me to take. I could end up spending my summer and countless hours, doing free grunt labor working on 'projects' that my employers expect me to either know how to do or learn on my own.

It should be noted though, that both companies are completely legit and have been established for more than 3+ years and have 8+ employees each. The CTO and Lead Engineer from the SWE startup seem to be ex-FAANG with 300+ connections on LinkedIn.

I've read numerous posts about unpaid internships and the stigma behind them. Trust me, I completely understand. But I can't help but feel my situation is a tad different, or at least different enough to be considered another look.

tldr; graduating in a year, aspiring SWE, have no experience. Debating between a relevant unpaid internship or irrelevant paid internship (both in startups)."

Currently I am a junior/senior in computer science, and I can do the work, I am above average in my programming skill, in my opinion, and have several large projects under my belt. These range from automated web bots, to image generation, to some small game development. 

I have had internships in cyber security, working for three letter agencies in the government, and currently I am working for one of those agencies part time, doing network analysis. 

There is just one small problem, I hate it, I don't hate the work, I hate the idea of staring at screens for the next 30 years of my life, I hate the idea of pouring over log data, and lines of code until I eventually save up enough to retire. I hate the idea of a few more years of college, then having to work in an office for decades to come. 

I know what I'd like to do, the only time I ever really feel happy is when I'm driving somewhere, and in the past I've driven across the country, from DC to death valley california, just for fun. I want to become a truck driver, like a long haul semi truck driver. 

The idea of driving 11 hours a day makes me smile, in a way that very few other things have. But, I'm afraid of disappointing my friends and family, im a young guy, still in my early 20s, but I'm not sure what I should do, would it be better to play it safe, or take a chance at something I know I'll love doing?

I have a previous associates degree in computer engineering, and a transfer degree in arts, so I am also feeling so burned out trying to get a bachelor's in computer science as well. It all just seems so pointless, especially with the pandemic moving everything virtual 

Tl;dr has anyone out there given up a lucrative job, or completely changed your career for the chance at making yourself happier? I could use some advice, or even just things to think about"

I'm currently doing my master's and I'm in my last year. Fortunately, I've got an insane opportunity to join a Fortune 500 company as an intern.

But, there is one issue: The company is 30 miles away from my home so in order to get in the office before 8AM, I would have to wake up at 5:45AM. I would be home at 3PM tho. I have to work 4-5 times a week. 

So, the only issue is, waking up early. To be honest, I usually sleep between 5-7 hours, most of the times I sleep 6 hours and I'm totally fine.

Essentially I had a job in the Bay Area for when I graduated in May 2020 that has been post-poned that may or may not exist come post-Covid, so in the mean time I’ve taken a remote engineering job while still living in the northeast. I’m trying to get out of this area so I’m still applying to the Bay Area aggressively, but am getting basically nothing in response, and been applying since summer 2019, before my senior year. 

I only have one EE internship and the rest of my time in college I spent working a very good retail job that I needed to keep for benefits and such, so it limited my ability to work other experiences for EE. I feel like my lack of experience is what is dragging me down, as I graduated with a very good GPA otherwise and am still not getting responses.

Maybe it’s lack of experience, I’m sure a lot of it is pandemic related, but I had a similar experience when I was initially applying in 2019 as well, so it’s making me rethink things.
I started this remote job in December, and while I like it, I don’t want to stay here and I want to move. The experience I’m getting at the remote job is microcontroller/firmware design with some schematic design on that as well.

I feel like the experience in getting now would be good experience to put on a resume, but I’ve only been working there for three months, and in general, I don’t want to put off potential employers thinking I just spend half a year trying to find a job and now I’m going to jump ship after three months. Would it be feasible to put this job as an internship without an end date, just a December-Present marking but mark as an EE intern, and put it on my resume that way? I see it as employers will see I’m getting experience but still actively looking for a full time position, but maybe I’m not thinking properly.

I’m not sure what the best option is here, but I don’t want to have to work for 6-12 months and stay here another year longer than I was planning just because I’m afraid to put more experience on a resume. I realize that might end up being the case anyways, but I’m just looking for any option to make myself seem more attractive to the other coast where no one really seems to be giving my resume a second thought. I’ve had two interviews since last summer when I started reapplying to the area and it basically has come down to me not having the experience that they needed for what they wanted to do, and I can’t go back and apply for more internships prior to graduation now.

tl;dr: how unethical is it to put a current short lived full time job as an internship on a resume to not make it look like I’m a job hopper but that I’m getting valuable experience?

I wanted to ask you guys about some resources you use to look for unpaid internships (or just internships in general). For some context, I'm a rising Junior majoring in Computer Science with very little internship experience (the only experience I had was with a research project under a Professor). I want to get some internships related to Computer Science to get some real life experiences, but I don't have any other experiences that would make me a good candidate. The only other ""experience"" I have is an online course about web development that I took in Udemy.

I thought I would look towards unpaid internships to raise my chances of getting hired as an intern. My school has a program that funds students who take unpaid internships, so I think this would be the best course of action for me. I've looked online and used internship resources like Indeed or Handshake, but I find it very difficult to find any entry-level unpaid internship opportunities. If you guys have any tips or resources that you are willing to share, I'd be very grateful.

On the other hand, I'm also waiting for decisions from UBC, UAlberta, UManitoba and USas. Some of them are almost guaranteed, but I don't want to miss the possible opportunity here, as Calgary is also a big city full of possibilities.

Some of the aspects that I'm worried about:

1. Job market/Economic Situation: Calgary is mostly tied with O&amp;G, but that isn't what I really want to work in the future. Do you think it's possible to find internships in other cities? Or would my local intern experience be acknowledged when I'm applying for a permanent job in another city?
2. Supervisor/research field: I was notified I'll have two supervisors, but unfortunately they don't seem to fit well with my research interest. One of them is more focused on theory, and I'm more interested in application. She is really nice when it comes to advising and supervising, but I'm just not sure how much it would hurt since we aren't a perfect ""match"". On the other hand, if I'm not going to stay in the academia, and work in industries, would it really matter about my research experience? So that I don't need to worry about it as long as I can find good internships to gain the experience?
3. Flexibility: I'm glad I can have full funding, but at the same time I'm worried if that will limit the flexibility on my study plan. For example, would it be applicable if I want to defer my enrollment for a year? Or if I want to take a year off during my master's study for internships or other personal plans? It's like the department is paying for my study, so I feel like I have a responsibility to cooperate over my personal development.
4. I really hate to talk about this, but... she's a Chinese professor whose students are mostly Chinese, so am I. I'm worried that I'll just stay in their small circle and lose the opportunity to embrace the amazing foreign culture, which is I believe to be one of the most important experience of studying abroad. It's like there's an unspoken rules that most Chinese professors would admit Chinese students, and of course with their own reasons(or excuses). I just don't want to jump out of China and rush into Chinatown. :("

Some of the aspects that I'm worried about:

1. Job market/Economic Situation: Calgary is mostly tied with O&amp;G, but that isn't what I really want to work in the future. Do you think it's possible to find internships in other cities? Or would my local intern experience be acknowledged when I'm applying for a permanent job in another city?
2. Supervisor/research field: I was notified I'll have two supervisors, but unfortunately they don't seem to fit well with my research interest. One of them is more focused on theory, and I'm more interested in application. She is really nice when it comes to advising and supervising, but I'm just not sure how much it would hurt since we aren't a perfect ""match"". On the other hand, if I'm not going to stay in the academia, and work in industries, would it really matter about my research experience? So that I don't need to worry about it as long as I can find good internships to gain the experience?
3. Flexibility: I'm glad I can have full funding, but at the same time I'm worried if that will limit the flexibility on my study plan. For example, would it be applicable if I want to defer my enrollment for a year? Or if I want to take a year off during my master's study for internships or other personal plans? It's like the department is paying for my study, so I feel like I have a responsibility to cooperate over my personal development.
4. I really hate to talk about this, but... she's a Chinese professor whose students are mostly Chinese, so am I. I'm worried that I'll just stay in their small circle and lose the opportunity to embrace the amazing foreign culture, which is I believe to be one of the most important experience of studying abroad. It's like there's an unspoken rules that most Chinese professors would admit Chinese students, and of course with their own reasons(or excuses). I just don't want to jump out of China and rush into Chinatown. :("

Some stats:

GPA: 3.5+

Licenses/Certifications: SIE and LAH license

Relevant coursework: Financial Management, Big Data in Finance, Investments Analysis

Relevant Internships: Equity Comp Analyst (lost due to Covid)

I’m interested in breaking into the private wealth management space. I’m curious if I am applying to the right roles or if I am totally off as to where I should be applying. Basically I am trying to stay away from the larger banks and been applying to smaller boutique investment/wealth management firms (family RIA office) for a more immersive experience. 

Would Client Service Associate/Private Client Associate roles be the correct position title? Thanks!"

So I'm a computer science senior in my last semester. As the title states, I've been seriously struggling to land a job for after my graduation. As some background info, I go to a small private college but it is accredited and fairly well-known in my area. I have a 3.85 GPA and have interned at a federal company for almost 2 years. The internship role wasn't SUPER technical (more like data visualization/analytics with some scripting, queries, etc). I like to think of myself as a pretty sociable person as well, and have always done well in behavioral parts of interviews. However, I do struggle with technical interviews under pressure, so I think that's had an effect in getting job offers. I've sent out dozens of job applications but just don't hear anything back. 

My main question is, what am I doing wrong? I wonder if I can partially blame it on my location - it's a city of around 200,000 people, but there are very very few tech companies - I can think of maybe like two. I also can't really move because I'm getting married in July, so I can't relocate to a bigger city until he graduates next year (he's still in college). Remote work is an option but applying for that seems really competitive as they get multiple applicants.

I guess I'm just frustrated. I'm not looking for a job in FAANG, or something that pays $80000+, or something that is top of the tech industry. I just want a job in CS. It's disheartening that I've been working my ass off since high school and have spent my summers doing internships instead of roadtripping or seeing my friends back home, and now there's not much to show for it. Am I doing something wrong? Will it be easier in a more tech-focused city? We are planning to move after he graduates.

Thank you!"
m5rhyk,35,2021-03-15,How to deal with constant rejection,BlueGrape123,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/m5rhyk/how_to_deal_with_constant_rejection/,"Hey guys,

If you hate reading sad, depressing, rant-y type posts, you should probably skip this one.

Woke up today to another rejection. Rejection after rejection after rejection. I just can't take it anymore, and am exhausted and depressed. Constantly getting to the penultimate or final round only to be rejected. Maybe there's something genuinely wrong with me that only others are able to see? This one stung the most.

I got to Capital One final round for the business analyst position, studied for around 2-3 weeks reading Case in Point and developing my quantitative/problem solving skills solving SAT/ACT/SHSAT/PSAT/GRE/GMAT basically any questions I could get my hands on. I told my friends ""no"" at least 4 weekends in a row to hangout or even talk, studied 24/7, literally ate meals in my room, put off studying for my classes (will likely fail my finals now), went through around 800 entries in glassdoor, and did everything I could to prepare for this interview. That included going over behavioral interviews, preparing for the product interview, and practicing in front of the mirror and speaking out loud.

Wore my best suit on interview day, thought I did really, really well. Today morning, my recruiter left me a voicemail. Called back and he basically said ""yeah we can't move forward with you, we found better candidates, good luck."" Thing is, there was already a rejection letter in my email account. So why did he feel the need to tell me that again in person? Does he want me to kill myself?? It's easy for these people to reject candidates, but they always forget there are actual human beings on the other side of the call and a lazy 5 second rejection with no explanation after I put in probably over 30-40 hours preparing for this is NOT OK. Not to mention the anxiety I had leading up to the interview and panic attacks/asthma that the stress and anxiety caused the night before.

Why do they invite 99% of people to the final round only to hire mostly their returning interns and people who exhibit perfection in the interview? Idk now I have to restart the entire process once again. I've been doing this since last October, and I am quite frankly, very, very tired. At this point, I'd be happy to get some unpaid internship, or worse yet, PAY SOMEONE for the ""honor"" to work for them.

I go to a good UC school studying math/econ with a pretty good GPA, solid resume, good communication skills, great problem solving skills,......i just dont know what im doing wrong. Feel like I'm gonna be homeless pretty soon. The first perfect SAT Score, 99th percentile GRE score, national merit scholar, AP scholar, presidential scholar, nearly straight A student, homeless kid, wouldn't that be hilarious. Someone who has worked through thousands of math problems, reached out to help others, and always tried my hardest....homeless. Maybe its what I deserve. I've got Optiver to look forward to in the summer.....but let's be honest, that's not happening. They only take genius kids even though the recruiter said I was ""close"" to passing the OA, she could've been lying. It's a joke that I'm even considering quant trading when I can't get something like Capital One.

Anyway, now that we're past the self-pity bull shit, I would appreciate advice on what I should do from here. I'm looking for analyst/business analyst/financial analyst/consulting type roles similar to the Cap One BA role. I could not care less about salary or location, I just want a job that will give me a good learning experience, decent exit opportunities/mobility, and one that won't waste my time with a 3 hour ""power day"" only to reject me in my face with no explanation. I've been mostly just going to companies direct websites and using [indeed.com](https://indeed.com)....are there any other websites I should be using? Thanks! And if there are any other graduating seniors that are going through the same thing, I would love to chat. I feel like I'm the only one in this situation, the rest of my friends and family are either still in school, or found a job, none in a limbo like me."

Im essentially at 1 YoE as an intern, and 2 YoE as a Full time engineer.

I’ve worked my ass off for my company, doing whatever it takes to get to climb the ladder and I’ve ended up in a position where I’m heavily depended on in my company. My company kind of runs like a startup and so despite only 9 months of experience as a SWE 1, my manager promoted me ASAP to try to keep me around. I’m looking for a new job now, and I feel like trying to get a SWE 2 position has been pretty daunting, especially since my experience at my current company is pretty specialized (I’m kinda an SDET doing some mobile apps development and Java test tool development). 

I want to switch out of mobile apps and do more of backend development, or really just anything out of mobile apps. However I fear that my resume doesn’t standup against an experienced mid level developer who has consistently worked in backend, since my experience is kind of split between mobile apps and Java development. I do have a good amount of experience and meet a lot of requirements on some level 2 postings (experience with CI/CD, SQL, Docker, Java platform tech like Spring, etc), but I feel that it might not be the depth that companies are looking for in a level 2.

I’ve also read on some other posts here that going backwards (level 2 to level 1) kind of raises some red flags when applying to other places in the future. 
Is this a valid concern? Especially when I’m a recent grad whose only worked at one place? At what point would you say someone should stop applying for a level 1 position and go only for level 2 positions?

Would appreciate any feedback and thoughts that anyone has, thanks!"

I was planning on doing the pre-trial diversion program to get this off my record but as I said, I haven't gotten my court date yet.

Since I’ve recently graduated from undergrad, I’ve been unable to apply to the majority of internship opportunities that I’ve found.

Now that I’ve been accepted into a program, can I put it on my resume to better my chances for a summer internship, or is it dishonest to put that program on my resume until I’ve actually begun classes?

My background is mainly in sales/marketing, but I realized that I wanted to pursue an old dream that I originally thought as naïve and unrealistic.

During the pandemic, I did some soul searching and realized that I wanted to help businesses make better decisions, specifically ones that strengthened customer loyalty. Looking into careers, I found business analysis. After taking courses on SDLC, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I decided to continue pursuing BA as a career.

It's been a year since I've started job searching, and I still haven't been able to get one interview. I've revised my resume many times to show how my sales experience translates to the BA field, and included cover letters, but still nothing.

I don't have experience in the BA field, despite studying the industry. For entry level positions, you need experience, but since I graduated college two years ago, I'm not eligible for internships, and I don't have the experience for contract positions.

Recently I've been told to try networking with hiring managers on Linkedin. I tried that, not a lot of responses. Inquired about this approach on Reddit, apparently it's not a great way to get the attention of employers, especially if you don't have the experience many other candidates have to offer.

I'm starting to slowly give up on becoming a BA. It's suggested that I look at financial analysis since it's easier to enter than the BA field. Looked into it, apparently it's still difficult for someone with my background to enter.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so tired of this. It's like what I do is never enough. I do one thing to advance my chances, but apparently it's the wrong move. Maybe I should go back to school? Noooooo schooling isn't that great since experience is more important! Maybe I should get a certificate to get that experience? Nooooo, even with a certificate, you need experience to be accepted! Hmm mayb- NOPE!

Job searching for a career that I can genuine be good at has been a harrowing and unfruitful experience that constantly reminds me that nothing I do will have employers give me a chance. A small part in me nudges me to keep going, but every time I go on job sites, I get filled with dread knowing that nothing will come out of applying.

I'm this close to giving up and just staying in sales. I'm not sure if this is even worth my energy. **How do you guys keep going with job searching when nothing works?**"

I'm a CS Math double major, and the pandemic and online studies has taken a huge toll on me. I currently struggle to keep up with 5 classes (equivalent of 6 due to 2 of them being worth more credits) and there's one math class (not necessary for CS) that I'm struggling to keep up with because I can't deal with the amount of work I signed up for with online classes, and real life is not going well outside of that (family health issues).

I can barely listen to 10 min. of any zoom call without dozing off, and always have to put back double the effort to get back to speed. The math class I'm struggling with, I'm pretty sure I'm on the verge of failing (below C), and I was wondering if I should drop it/withdraw from it. The class itself isn't the issue, it's an entirely doable class, and it's entirely possible to do very well on it; I'm the problem here, and currently I'm not sure I can go through with it without failing.

How would dropping the class impact me for getting an internship in CS? My resume is already not good (it's pretty bad), but my current GPA is good, I have As pretty much everywhere, and I'm just starting to fall apart this semester. I'm not sure if I'll manage to find an internship even if I don't drop it and pass, but I really need one, so I'm really stressed out about dropping. Anyone knows how companies look at people who dropped a class?

m5xtiy,1,2021-03-15,Internship without work permit,artifishialbrain,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/m5xtiy/internship_without_work_permit/,"Hello everyone, before I explain my background I kindly ask that you look at this from a place of understanding. Please refrain from hateful comments as my current situation is not my fault and I cannot do anything to change it.

I was brought to the United States legally with my parents when I was six years old. After some time, we applied for a green card but long story short, there were some legal complications that my parents faced and ultimately our application was denied. Throughout the whole time, we were on a visa (I was a dependent) but my parents also decided to drop that because we were stuck in this limbo where we couldn’t continue on with our permanent residence process. I believe that is all of the necessary information there is to know about the current situation that I am in, but in essence, I do not have a valid working permit as of now.

This hasn’t stopped me from higher education though. I am a motivated 2nd year mechE student at a 4-year university with a 3.7 GPA interested in the field of design, materials, and manufacturing. I’ve been putting in tons of effort to do well in school over the past few years and I am committed to finishing my degree. Besides my studies, I am also well aware that outside experiences like internships/research are crucial to supplement my learning and future career prospects. This is where I’m starting to have trouble due to my background. As an introvert, it’s already been difficult to constantly seek out opportunities and network, but it makes it 10x harder having to explain to the company employer that I do not have a work permit while also giving them reasons on why they should hire me. It would obviously be a burden to hire someone with my background when I’m easily replaceable by tons of other hard working students that don’t have to deal with these issues. Many of the internships that I want to do are barred from me simply because I don’t have a valid work permit.

Despite all this, my school has an excellent support system for students like me; I have been in contact with the resource center since the start of this year. I learned that I can ask employers for shadow/unpaid positions and the school will actually give me stipends to work there. While this is definitely a step towards the right direction, most companies that I have been looking at require you to submit a resume through their online application process. The problem with this is is that in the application it always asks the question: “Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?” Obviously I answer no because I don’t want to lie about my status but I fear this is the factor that gets me automatically removed from the application pool. 

I’ve been thinking doing cold calls or emails but that’s a whole new monster that I have to face now. That is also why I’m reaching out to Reddit to ask some questions about this, but does anyone have suggestions on how I should go about sending these emails while also explaining my background? I’ve also been thinking about contacting smaller companies because they might be more lenient about my situation. Should I still be looking for these companies through Indeed, Glassdoor, etc, or is there another way to go about it? Simply searching things like “engineering design companies near me” hasn’t really be doing much for me.

The clock is ticking for me and I need to have done something before I finish my degree. I don’t have anything lined up for this summer yet either, but I plan on completing some personal projects if I can’t find anything.

Thanks for your time :)"

I have already decided with my parents that I am going to go into CS when I graduate from high school. The problem is that I may not be going to a regular 4-yr college(or even college at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

Next year I am going to start a program that my county has to let high schoolers take some courses in their locally community college(but ofc I won't get a degree from that). I plan on taking CS classes while I am in the program, and the classes could also help me in the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: How do I improve my resume or hireability as a regular high school grad with some college-level courses in my belt. I already have projects and know programming langs, I also plan on putting those college courses that I took on my resume to make it seem like I went to college(even though I didn't). How do I get internships in highschool? What else do you think that I could do so that I can get a job out of high school?

m61zi3,3,2021-03-16,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (3/15/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/m61zi3/weekly_job_qa_thread_3152021/,"Hi all,

Here is the fifty-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

If only I partied a bit less in my undergrad, If only I had that internship, If only I had that job offer. Today has been a day with a lot of If onlys.

Finally decided I need to pour out my feelings, and I started to write down everything that came to my mind, like a stream of consciousness flowing through my keyboard. In this state of despair, it came to me, this question, what do I have control over?

I only have control over my emotions, as to how I react to the events in my life, good or bad! I can't control if we are going to mars, or if I am getting into a grad school this cycle. I can only control how I react to these events, learning at each step what reality is trying to teach me, and use it to navigate life in a better way.

I feel this change of perspective is a key trait of someone who is successful in life. Hope y'all reading this achieve what y'all looking for someday!"

These past few months have been nothing short of exhausting. The search for an internship destroyed my self-confidence. Over 150+ applications sent, 3 interviews, 2 failed and currently stuck on google project search limbo (but odds are I won’t get a project). Coming from a very average Canadian CS student, who’s graduating in one year, I’m starting to have so many concerns about my future in the field if I don’t get an internship for this last summer before I graduate. 

I know I should’ve applied to more places back in September, but I didn’t think I would do this bad. Still sending applications, but at this height I doubt I’ll get any replies.  It’s also bad enough that half the places I look into won’t sponsor non us citizens as it’s not possible with the current visa situation. Are there any other Canadian students in this position? What will you do during the summer? I would love to hear from other people as at this point, I’m considering my summer to be wasted and I won’t be able to get any useful experience before graduation which scares me a lot. I appreciate anyone who read this, just really need some advice and to vent a little."

I am currently an intern in one of the FAANG companies. This year i will have my second internship. However, i was curious how hard is it to get into Facebook with my background?

I believe getting into that company was by pure luck, honestly, because i am not amazing at coding. I suppose my brain works fine for it, but i don't really have the knowledge it requires because my university is very, very bad. ( Hard to get into, but they don't really teach us anything). 

That being said, i worked a lot in my last internship to learn some things i believe i was supposed to know. But i learned them and i did ok. Do you think by practicing for a year i could have a chance at Facebook? ( in a year i will be a fresh grad and i never had any connections to fb). Do you have any resources i could use apart from coding challenges from hackerrank, leetcode etc.?"

It's really very discouraging as that was the module I really put in my all to understand. IT is my passion and I really hope I would take com sci as my degree.

Since my A level friends were applying to uni I decided to take a look as well. Most of them has received offers from NTU and even NUS. I really feel so worthless when I look at them, we're the same age and their futures seem so much better than mine. I can only blame myself for not working enough to get a good GPA.

At best I score 4.0 for my next two sems, my CGPA would not go above 3.3. Should I still try and aim for a com sci course in uni? Or should I just start working after I graduate?

Starting my first job next Monday as an software engineer intern with a company I'd aimed to land a gig with since starting my course in first year. Absolutely delighted, can't wait to start but after discovering here I figured I'd ask to anyone with experience; any advice going in?

I'm definitely nervous given it's my foot in the door on things. I know I'm a decent programmer, I love working with people and within a team so things like asking questions, making sure others are doing well/spitballing ideas isn't a fear for me because obviously it improves me learning by being around the people I'm working towards a goal with and are in this case, mentoring me to an extent.

I do push myself fairly hard into learning the correct way to do things as opposed to slapping on what works and moving on and try my best to be there for people in need, provided I'm not just doing their job for them if you get me. The company primarily works in C# for where I'll be at and unfortunately my programming lecturer decided C# wasn't necessary to touch on in the slightest given we were doing C++ this year and spent 2 years on Java (his opinion, not mine!). 

To get up to snuff with syntax I'm blasting through a C# book in my spare time. Sorry for the block of text, I wanted to paint sorta where I'm at before anyone offers any advice if you get me :)"

He has not been able to nail down even a summer internship this year (over 50 applications, maybe 10% offered interviews-had one offer but salary was joke-more than $5/hr below past internships and company wouldnt hire for summer unless he committed to work FT in fall at that rate-couldnt do as athlete anyway). What software should he study this summer to beef up his resume so he has many of the preferred qualification as well as required qualifications for financial analysis jobs?  Power BI vs Tableau, Salesforce, R, Python, MS Visio. Others? Which one or two should he focus on if he wants a corporate/manufacturing finance job as an analyst which these days also requires data analytics experience?

Now he may come home this summer to save $  and get a loan if he doesnt find an internship (still looking)-he still will have to pay rent on his college apartment.

It's my first big kid job outside the service industry and navigating corporate culture is weird.

For example, you only talk to eachother at meetings. Well, myself (public relations, tech writing intern) and two other interns (creative writing, and social media marketing) have a meeting with the guys up top tomorrow.

I have alot of ideas I'd like to get approved and implemented. Some are projects I'd take on, some are collabs, and some are even projects for other interns. 

TL:DR: Will compiling everything I have prepared and would like to discuss in an email to my boss prior to tomorrows meeting come off as too strong?

My concern stems from being the only female in the group, and the BS which is the fine line between being ""bossy"" and headstrong."

m6ckzb,0,2021-03-16,Advice on internship option,fizzyhere,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m6ckzb/advice_on_internship_option/,"Really tough choice ahead. Currently have 2 internship offers, one of which I have accepted

Company A (Currently Accepted)

* One of the biggest Financial investment bank,
* Higher compensation
* Poor Work life balance, competitive vicious environment, extremely long working hours
* Possibly easier to progress career

Company B (New Offer)

* One of the biggest financial tech firm, slightly less prestigious than A.
* Way better WLB, with great working culture
* Slightly lower compensation (\~10% lesser than A)
* Need to renege A to accept B.
* A company that I wanted to work full time for before applying

Both are summer programs which are basically hiring pipelines for full-time conversions. And I am treating this as opportunity for a full-time role in the company. I am currently stuck between grinding my life and health away at a toxic+competitive workplace **VS** somewhere i would genuinely like to work at, but sacrificing a little bit of career progression and compensation.

I understand that I am still young and I should grind it out. Meaning that i go for A now and maybe apply at B in the future when i am older. But B's full time hiring process is really tough and I honestly think that this internship pipeline is the best chance that I will have.  I am someone who prefer to stick to a company for at least 3-4 years and that's why i want to find a place that i will really fit in. What do you guys think, is it worth it?"

I have been admitted to the Masters in Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering for Fall 2021. I haven't seen too many student testimonials online and would like to know more about the program.

1. What is the coursework like? How rigorous is it?
2. How helpful are the professors, not only when it comes to the technical education but in terms of being able to ask for career advice?
3. How are the graduate opportunities for internships and jobs?
4. What scholarship opportunities exist, and how are the RA/TA positions allotted?
5. What is the research like in this field and how are the labs and facilities?
6. How much would work experience matter as I don't have much work-ex in this field except projects in my undergrad education?
7. Once I choose one out of the six research tracks, would all my coursework be restricted to that or will I have the opportunity to do some inter-track study?
8. Considering the program is quite expensive, is it worth the money?
9. Would it be better to stay on or off campus?
10. What is graduate student life like in general?
11. How is Boulder as a place to live for people in their early 20s and what is there to do with friends during leisure time?

Any help would be appreciated. If you know anyone who could help me with these queries, I would appreciate connecting with them as well.

m6f8ec,406,2021-03-16,What are these divots in your tablet screen?,ulfr,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/m6f8ec/what_are_these_divots_in_your_tablet_screen/,"I don't even want to think about how long ago this story took place, suffice to say it was many, many moons ago.

While I was in college I interned during the summer because at that time interns got paid better than burger flippers, and I was in the help desk portion of a very large company. Was still a very nervous little intern, it was the first job I ever had to wear a tie for and wanted to make a good impression, etc.

Suffice to say I was a lot less nervous and a lot more jaded by the end of this internship, but my most memorable experience was probably my second or third day and being sent by my supervisor to visit the office of one of the C-suite. (I want to say CFO but I don't remember.) Guy called in because his tablet's screen was black and reported that the power light would go off and on when he hit the power button, but display simply refused to turn on.

I got lost three times trying to even find the man's office, and when I finally do get there his secretary or admin or whatever she's called these days buzzes him. Dirtbag made me cool my heels for 10 minutes.

Finally get into this man's office and am trying VERY hard to keep it together. One of my first support cases and this man makes my salary in the time it takes for him to take a dump. Start examining the unit while he plays hunt and peck with his desktop. Nothing really pops out about the tablet, I flip it over and look at the back, nothing doing there either.

As I flip the thing back over the light catches it just so and I notice all these weird divots and grooves in the screen. I walk over to the window and try to catch the light better so I can look closer and the C-suite guy asks what I'm doing. I explain I noticed all these lines and such on the screen and they're not supposed to be there.

Guy says something to the effect of ""Oh, my pen leaves those."" Bear in mind this is REALLY old tech compared to this day and age. The tablet itself was probably two inches thick and heavy as hell. The stylus they came with had a nice fat tip that shouldn't dimple or groove the screen in the slightest. I look where the stylus is usually stored and notice that it's empty.

I ask him where the stylus is and he says the one that came with the tablet sucked and he threw it out and was using a better one. I ask him where the better one is and he pulls what looks like a bic pen from his suit front pocket.

There are no words to express how I felt at that moment. Equal parts horror and disgust, horror because I don't know how to tell this guy that he's an idiot, disgust because those tablets were NOT cheap. I'm pretty sure my mouth opens and closes a few times with no sound coming out before I finally land on a safe question, ""What did you do about all the ink on the screen?""

He opens one of his desk drawers and out comes a bottle of windex and some paper towels. At this point my inner monologue is shouting DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER.

I stammer something about running diagnostics and scurry back to IT. My supervisor sees me come back and smirks, ""How's his pen working for him?""

He's already got a replacement tablet ready to go, he just unscrews the hard drive cover from the unit with a dead screen and pops it in a replacement. It was a mandatory step to remove the stylus from the new tablet so he didn't realize we just kept replacing them. I guess he thought the IT elves just fixed it for us?"

Context: I am a recent bootcamp grad, and just finished an internship with a startup, and was offered full time employment. However the salary is relatively low(60K) and I live in a HCOL area. On top of this, most of the engineering team is off shore, and there doesn’t seem to be great structure or mentorship available. During the internship I had to figure out most of the code base myself and complete tickets with minimal guidance.

My question: does it make sense to take this job still and job search on the side? I see how hard it can be for a new grad(especially from a non-traditional background) to break into the field, so I don’t want to be foolish and turn down what might be my only opportunity at the time. On the other hand, I don’t want to stay at a company that I can’t properly grow and learn at, and am worried that if I take the job, i will slow down for applying to other jobs and sort of get stuck in this position for awhile.

Would it be reckless not to take the job?!

Thanks ahead for your thoughts!"

I finally get my first entry job as a Mobile Engineer after graduate 3 months ago. I just want to share this story to encourage everyone to keep applying for jobs and you guys will get it.

About me:

* I'm a new grad from a small state college in the Midwest.
* I only have 1 intern experience with a Mid-size local company.
* I have about 2-3 different volunteer position that is related to CS.
* I have about 4 -5 different projects on Github (Mobile app, IoT Application, Full-Stack web application)

As you can see, I don't have much experience, and I also require companies to sponsor me in the future if they want to take me in for a long term. I applied for about \~ 500 different jobs around the U.S.

* I got 1 offer.
* I got 3 on-site.
* I got about 12 interviews.
* I got plenty of rejection and ghosted from companies, I think around 337 rejections and plenty of ghosted email. [https://imgur.com/gOkASBF](https://imgur.com/gOkASBF)

I know that we are living in a scary time right now, I know that it's hard to get a job. I also understand the frustration, depression, and tiredness of this job searching process. There is plenty of time that I'm thinking about giving up. However, my family and friends are always there for me to support me. That's how I get through all of the burnout from applying for jobs.

Finally, I just want to say that you guys will get through it.  The most important thing that you guys should do is taking care of your mental and health. After that keep applying for jobs, working on personal projects, practicing behavior questions, and leetcode. We will get through this together!

If you need someone to talk to, please leave a comment here. I know it may sound strange, but having people support you is one of the biggest things that help me on the journey of getting my job offer.  


Edit 1: Thank everyone for the rewards. I'm really happy that I can help many people feel less stressed out about the job search process!"

Like the title says, I just got my first interview for an internship position over the summer and freaking out a bit. I frequently visit this sub and I've seen a lot of questions like this before but hopefully I can get some advice as someone trying to break into the field.

I deal with a lot of anxiety and frequently blank when put on the spot for things. Being tested has never been my strong suit and I'm worried if I'm asked technical questions in the interview, I'll panic and draw a blank. But at the same time, I regularly see the advice (in this sub and other places) that interviews shouldn't be crammed for. Does anyone have their two cents or advice on this? 

The position is officially called 'Infrastructure Business Operations Co-Op Student' and the job description basically outlines a help desk position in a mixed Windows/Mac environment.

I am international student and I was on internship in a company. I talked to the manager after graduating and he told me to apply for the opening. I can work on OPT for one year and then get a two year extension. That means I have three chances of h1b application which is on lottery basis, so every chance is very valuable. 

After the interview, I got call from recruiter that hiring manager has asked him to offer me the job, and then I asked if company would sponsor my h1b visa? To which he replied that company will put me in visa lottery in October. I told him that registrations open in March or April, that's when companies register for their candidates and if they are picked then you get visa in October. He later confirms that said that yes company will register for me when registrations open and I will be put in visa lottery three times. And if I don't get picked then I will be terminated. 

Then I got a job offer in February and I accepted it. But my start date had to be extended to April because my opt hasn't been approved by uscis yet as there has been delays because of Covid. In March I emailed recruiter asking what are the documents company will need for my h1b registration, to which he replied that I will be put in visa lottery in October (same thing as earlier) and then I again explained everything in email about registration opening in March and all that. But he replied with same email that I will be put in visa lottery in October. Then I again explained everything in a long email. 

Recently I got a call from recruiter that company has missed the deadline for my h1b registration (which is still open) and that they can not guarantee that I will be sponsored in future for h1b. 

I have been very stressed out. I rejected other job offer to accept this one, so I contacted them and asked if offer still stands and if they would sponsor h1b? HR told me that yes offer still stands and they will file for visa next year as it's too late for this year. 

I don't know if it would be okay for me to reject the offer after accepting it and just go to other company. What should I do? I was thinking of emailing hiring manager too."

So I cannot seem to decide between UF or UMiami. I was accepted to both, however UMiami only gave me 13k in scholarships (though I have bright futures + prepaid but still does not cover everything).

I am planning on going to law school and cannot seem to decide what is the best choice.

&amp;#x200B;

UF is exceptionally ranked nationally and best ranked in Florida, both overall and in my majors; although Miami is still an excellent school and the city offers much more opportunities for internships, work, and networking (although UF is also great for connections) compared to the small college town of Gainesville. However, Miami comes at a heavy cost to access all that the university and the city has to offer.

Another thing to note, UF has the Information Systems major that I want and prefer to computer science, although UMiami has the computer science major specialization in cybersecurity which I also really like. Either way, both are great top schools, but I just can't seem to decide. It seems kind of dumb to not choose the school that would be free with ""better"" academics according to rankings.

Here is where the problem lies.

I am new to this field. They hired me on knowing my skills and that this would be my first real It job. The only experience I have had before this is my personal experience working on my family's computers and an internship I had at a public school. I am also full-time going to college for IT which they are aware of. 

I sometimes struggle with tickets and when I reach out for help with my team, they will sometimes tell me to reach out to engineers who are not helpful at all. They act like I'm dumb and know nothing and talk about how dumb I am behind my back. They easily get away with this because I currently work from home. 

As a result of them, I got a bad annual review. I only know this because my team lead called me on his personal phone after work and told me. I make okay money for where I live but not the best ($17 an hour). Is this a common situation or should I look for other employment?"

I am hoping to land a job as a quantitative researcher after I graduate (also interested in quant development and fpga programming), so right now I am trying to focus my class and work schedule on making myself the best candidate possible for these positions in finance. I have not held a finance internship.

I am also working on getting a research role in the statistics department to strengthen my skills and make myself a better candidate for grad school and for quant roles.

My plan at the moment is to add a statistics minor, and to graduate in a total of 4.5 years. After this i will have ideally been accepted to a graduate quantitative finance program, or have been accepted into an actual quant role. 

I am wondering if it is worth it to take on the additional stress of the statistics minor, and whether it will actually improve my job outlook that much. If I didn’t add the statistics minor, I would most likely graduate in 4 years total, but this takes away a summer to potentially land a relevant internship. 

The same question goes for the research role. Will the extra work really help me that much? Or am i loading up on stress for no reason?"

theres a bit of shit post mixed in. Sorry about that but I had 2 midterms today and got rejected by 2 companies. 🙃

&amp;#x200B;

Asking for myself. Currently in my junior year and the only jobs I can find are local jobs that think $10 an hour is a lot. Honestly this years been a massive ego blow. I spent months working on several projects and building work experience at startups to be destroyed by leetcode hard questions. I know I have come incredibly far. This same time last year I could barely write a python script and run it on the terminal. Now I work as a full backend engineer at a local startup and I also run cloud functionality. I should be happy but I am depressed because I promised myself last year when I started this journey I would get a good internship and here I am a year later with still no good internship. **The only way to recover my pride is to take down a giant next year**. As the title says 2Sigma, Stripe, Virtual Financial or DRW.  I added mathematical economics a second major and I finally have taken enough relevant classes to not be blindsided at an interview.

I refuse to lose next year. I mean it. **Refuse**. I've started praying to leetcode gods everyday for at least one hour sometimes more. I have 2 research projects I plan to do before July when the early applications begin. Still I would love the perspective of some who have won the battle.

Please if you have been blessed to work at one of these fine high paying companies  Could you share you story and maybe some preemptive advice for 2022? How did you prepare? When did you start studying? Maybe some fun project ideas as well.

I financial cannot afford to go another year without a good internship. I'll never be able to love myself.Im joking but not really please help."

I would like some advice about whether it will be more feasible for me to try and find an internship in the UK to try and possibly convert in the future (but risk not converting) or find some other (possibly non-S&amp;T) job in the UK which will pay less but allows me to stay in the UK (alongside opportunities to move up in the future if possible but I've been advised to start out somewhere that has reputation) or should I just stick to the job offer that I already have, not risk anything, learn everything product related during my grad scheme and then attempt to do a Masters/MBA in the future to try another time at securing a job in UK?

I started my own game design company Dream Path Studios. After a year of collaboration with contract workers, we released our first game ""Dental Madness: Cavity Mania."" The game was created from scratch using Unity3D Game Engine. The following is my story about the development of the game from start to finish.

[Launch trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKgcA0rOM)

[Steam Store link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374900/Dental_Madness_Cavity_Mania/)

**Concept**

In order to obtain an internship at Full Sail University's VR/AR Lab, I was required to pitch a practical, real-world simulation to the head of the lab. My Dad, a dentist with 34 years of experience, inspired me to create a virtual reality training simulation based on dentistry. Many dentists have difficulty staying proficient with the dental mirror and drill technique. The initial concept focused on using the dental drill and mirror in concert to locate and drill cavity decay on teeth that could not be seen with direct vision. The original game Dental Madness used magnetically tracked, handheld controllers with VR headsets in a full 3D environment. The project was such a huge success, we went on to receive the Most Innovative Game Award at the I/ITSEC 2018 Serious Games Showcase &amp; Challenge. We were competing against other games with themes such as chemistry, exploration, and platforming. This success gave me the motivation to create my own game design company and launch my own game.

**Development**

I used the concept from the original ""Dental Madness"" as the impetus for a new game. My Dad believed in the project and funded the development of this venture. I created a prototype of a 3D dental game with a mouse and keyboard control scheme in Unity3D Game Engine. Unity3D is a Game Engine that allows developers to create GameObjects and other necessary elements to make and code a game or simulation. To help me expand upon the prototype, I brought a programmer onto the project. We worked in a continuous cycle of development and testing. At first, I was the only one playtesting the game and providing feedback to the programmer. Once the game had taken better shape, we reached out to others. Family, friends, associates, and classmates helped to provide feedback during our different test phases (Alpha, Beta, and Charlie). I also collaborated with artists and graphic designers to create art assets such as the menus, leaderboards, and promotional materials.

**Music**

At first, I attempted to compose and record the music for the game myself. The results from my personal recording sessions were mixed and I was not fully satisfied that most of the ragtag songs would be high enough quality for DM:CM. One song from these sessions made it into the game as the End Credits song. It was Providence that Taras Terletskyy, a sound designer from Ukraine, reached out to me on LinkedIn. I sent him links to some inspiration tracks from classic video games that I liked. Taras then used elements from those songs to influence his composition of the Main Menu song that you hear in DM:CM. We used a similar process for the gameplay song, except this time I sent him popular music tracks for inspiration. Taras is an incredibly talented composer and musician and it was an absolute pleasure working with him.

**Completion**

""Dental Madness: Cavity Mania"" took one year of development from prototyping to release. We **released it on August 18th, 2020** and we continue to update the game. From prototype to release, 750 hours were worked for ""Dental Madness: Cavity Mania"" (that includes the time of the programmer, artists, and myself). The project cost around $6000 in total, not including any promotion.

**Difficulties**

It was a little shaky in the early months of development after I had created the initial prototype. Thankfully, bringing Will Bono onto the project as programmer/developer reinvigorated DM:CM. We collaborated very smoothly to expand upon the concept of the prototype into full levels and tutorials. The original ""Dental Madness"" was such a thrill to work on. However, due to the expenses and challenges of mass-producing it for consumers, the VR simulation remains unreleased. Because of this, I was motivated to work through obstacles on DM:CM. I greatly wanted to publish a gamified dental simulation that was more accessible to gamers of all types. The sound effects and music remain a challenge in the game. Making sure the drill sound stops playing when the player releases the Space bar has been strangely problematic. There have also been bugs with overlapping songs when transitioning between different sections of the game.

**Starting The Company**

In August of 2019, I created **Dream Path Studios** as a DBA of my existing Limited Liability Company Denver's Best Podcast (podcasting since 2014). The previous experience with my podcast company helped me to some extent, especially having the confidence to start a new venture. The name Dream Path comes from growing up being constantly told to ""follow my dreams"" and also having an active imagination and very wild and vivid dreams when sleeping. It also is heavily influenced by the Henry David Thoreau quote; ""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams!""

**Launching The Game**

We published the game on Steam first. The process is pretty thorough and takes time. Steam does a good job of explaining and guiding along the way. The Steam Support folks are very helpful as well. I reached out to them multiple times and always received prompt responses with good advice. As for determining a price, I settled on $9.99. Players get three tutorials, twenty levels of cavity decay elimination, a great soundtrack, and our continuous improvements and additions to the game, all for $9.99. I also think about all the Game Design/Development studies that Will and I have completed. The knowledge from our degrees went into making this game. If $9.99 seems high to you at this moment in time, please Wishlist the game on Steam and keep an eye out for Steam Sales. Sometimes we drop the price to $3.99 for the duration of the Steam Sale. Thank you for considering buying and supporting ""Dental Madness: Cavity Mania""!

**What’s Next?**

I will continue to provide updates for Dental Madness: Cavity Mania. A build-your-own level feature is in the works, I am looking to have online leaderboards soon as well. There could even be a mobile game project in the works. Thank you so much for listening to my story and I hope this inspires you to follow your dreams. Don't be afraid to keep making more games. There may be failures, but that is how we learn :)

It has been a tough year for applying without a doubt. An influx of applicants, losing internships and such due to COVID, struggling with online school, and much more that i can’t even begin to explain. So this goes for everyone. I am proud of us and you should be too. 

For those of you who did not get into that school you dreamed of for possibly years. I’m really sorry and speaking from personal experience we will get through it and come out better. You tried hard and put ur heart and soul into that application and i know that hurts. But we will get over it and are. We will find the right school for us or we have. 

For those of you who did get into your dream school. Congratulations you absolutely deserve it you worked very hard and the work is paying off. Celebrate you deserve to be happy 

For those of you still waiting. Stay calm i know it is nerve wracking. Try not to check the portal EVERY hour and please prepare yourself for the worst and the best.  

For all of us who are drained. I know it’s almost over i promise you it is almost time to relax and finally figure out your future. 

For everyone who has had to cope with giving up prestige and are coping with that. Remember college is different from high school you don’t have to keep comparing yourself to your high school classmates you can completely let go of all of that and start over. Prestige is not everything college is what you make of it and if you are as dedicated as i know you are you will make the most of it anywhere 

Lastly i want everyone to remember to chose where they will be happy. Your happiness is most important. You could get into a top 10 school but if you are unhappy you will not make the most of that opportunity if your happiness is in a top 300 school good for you go be happy. You WILL get educated no matter where you go 

-sincerely someone rejected from their dream school and has found happiness in a top 250 school and is so excited to go there and make the most out of my college experience"

What should his next steps be?,ChemicalOnion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m6osc5/brother_has_been_searching_for_1st_job_in/,"For background, I myself am a computer science graduate and have been in the field now for almost 10 years. My brother graduated last spring with a degree in computer engineering. He struggled through school, with a GPA just under 3. I tried to get him to take an internship in his junior year, but he said school was too stressful at that time. Since he graduated, I've tutored him to develop his skills in Java, JavaScript, HTML, and MySQL. He's done plenty of leetcode problems, and even coded a decently complex board game and has that on his Github and resume.

He's now stuck in this void where he can't do internships because he isn't in school, he isn't being taken seriously for entry level positions (anything in Minnesota that's labeled as entry level seems to want prior work experience, but even the ones where he had a few interviews go beyond the initial phone call, he rarely received a coding interview), and he appears to be getting automatically rejected for some of the local technical development programs due to his GPA being just shy of 3. I feel terrible that I can't help him get his foot in the door. I've tried referring him to my own company, and even they have yet to give him a proper interview.

Is it unrealistic for him to find work locally? I've suggested to him that he may need to be open to moving, but he is very much a family person and he is nervous about moving across the country. I also suggested he may need to do a coding bootcamp to acquire more skills, though I honestly feel like he has more than I ever had when I got my first job. Are we just not looking in the right places for jobs?

And is there anything else I can do better as the concerned brother? I care about him a lot and this is taking a tremendous toll on him mentally. Thanks!

tl;dr what do people in the midwest do these days to get their foot in the door? It seems like every position up here is more demanding than ever."

I'm a prospective student planning on majoring in CS at UTD. I'm a National Merit Finalist, so I'd get full tuition + housing/book stipends + a study abroad stipend. Obviously this makes UTD a super good option financially lol, and I've heard lots of good things about the CS program.

My only concern is that I'm from California, and I plan on coming back to California and working in the Bay Area after college. I'm worried that I'd miss out on networking for internships and jobs, and that I might be at a disadvantage since I'm not planning to stay in the DFW area.

I've already been accepted into a couple good in-state schools for CS, so I do have other options that are still affordable (although none of them are full-ride like UTD). 

Is my concern actually valid? How hard would it be for me to find out-of-state internships and jobs as a UTD student? I'd especially love to hear from any other CA students who were deciding between CSUs/UCs and UTD.

Thank you so much!"

Apologies that this for the long post. 

I' moved to australia 3 years ago for a change of environment. Managed to get a job within 2 months.  Been working in it since then.

I was hired for a cybersecurity role (ive prior experience in this field), however throughout my 3 years  here i've only been given 1 cybersecurity project. Initially i didnt care much about it as i was enjoying being in a new country, then i realised that i could have been shortchanged or misplaced. I was in denial, i told myself not to complain because the work here is a breeze, less stress. But over time im not happy because i wasnt given the opportunity to stretch my mental muscle or display my skills. i fee stagnant.

last year, I spoke to my reporting manager (same person who hired me), he said there will be a shuffle in the org and i will be placed in a cybersecurity team. I was put in that team but i am STILL being assigned to generic IT projects. The reasons he gave is that there is a short of staff, and majority of the staff are new. Though he constantly say my technical finesse in cybersecurity is good. I dont know why is he not addressing it, im certain that hes BS-ing me. Everything seems contradicting.

Since Oct, ive been applying to jobs in my home countries as my wife's secondment here is ending. I've applied to 50+ companies, had interviews with  10 companies. Out of the 10, 3 of them gave me hopes of getting employed. After each interview i advanced to another within 2 days interval. I was also given written feedback that im technically proficient, good attitude etc.  Things were moving fast and i had a sense that i could be the one. However they ghosted me in the end either gave me general response that they are still reviewing the candidates or there were stronger candidates. This is very demoralising, i prepped very hard for these interviews. i believe it was due to the prep work that took me this far.

My wife will be going back to our home country next month as her secondment ended. i choose to stay as here until i get a job. My home country has age discrimination in employment and recently the government is encouraging people over 40 years old to take up training or ""internship"" for $1k per month. i dont want to be a in situation where employers have an leverage to exploit me as im jobless.

i will continue to look for jobs and prep for interviews but i've to admit that a huge chunk of my morale is bruised. Can someone give me advices or help to 'pick' myself up ?"

I know this is probably gonna be the typical student/new grad post many of you see here from time to time but I feel this is the only place where maybe someone can relate to my struggles.

I'm currently a Undergrad Senior with just 7 classes left to graduate but I am currently having serious struggles at the very end of this part of the journey and I'm starting to feel I am unable to recover.

I am more fearful of my career prospects than I am happy to be graduating soon. I decided to focus on becoming an Android Developer as my first role in this field however I am starting to crack under pressure from every single thing. I currently have no actual finished projects to showcase to obtain any internships or experience necessary for me to obtain an entry level position. While knowing this I lack the time necessary to contribute to this due to the classes I have left in college and to make it worse I am struggling bad in nearly every class.

Algorithms class is seriously affecting my confidence as a software engineer as I feel very confused in nearly every lecture and I struggle to catch up no matter how much I try to read textbooks and attempt projects. At the end of each day I constantly feel that I didn't accomplish or improve in any way even after spending hours studying. Thinking about switching careers this late into my life will basically prove that the last 5 years of life were an absolute waste and I cannot accept that. To make matters even worse I don't have time on my side due to me having to move out exactly a year from now and I live in one of the most expensive metro cities in the U.S.

Where exactly do I go from here? How do I tackle these issues? Should I just ultimately accept my failure and go through a ""quarter life crisis""?

I honestly feel like this field asks too much out of us and I wish I knew this years ago before fully committing. Feel like we have to sell our souls and time just to be experienced and valued in this field."

I’m in the co-op program, meaning I work 4 months, study 4 months. I really want to break into finance, but want to have a sound strategy so I don’t end up jobless for my next co-op term, since If I were to choose to look for a finance related job, I would have to tell my current b4 employer that I won’t be returning next co-op term. So now I’m wondering: what kinds of finance jobs can a Canadian sophomore get and are those jobs any better than another 4 months of big 4 audit?

I graduated last May from a well-known college last year (MIS) and found a job as a Data Analyst soon after at a small company. I have less than a year of professional experience excluding capstone project (5 months) and internships (total 4 months). 

I have been trying to find analytical jobs at big companies and start-ups for over a year now but haven't had much luck. I use Excel, tableau and SQL mostly and create data models, dashboards and reports. I have had my resume reviewed by a lot of my alumni and it is in a good shape. I apply using referrals, sometimes cold-emailing recruiters/ HMs, or directly in a few cases. I am thinking of getting Tableau certification.

My question is why am I not receiving any calls? How much do the pandemic and YOEs (or the lack thereof) weigh? Any idea when or how will my chances improve? 

Would appreciate any insights or suggestions, thanks!"

I wouldn’t be surprised if a mod took this down using their discretion. 

IM OUT HERE TRYNA GET INTO COLLEGE BUT THE PANDEMIC KEEPS CUCKING ME.

1. SERIOUSLY WHO THE FUCK RULED THAT THE UCS HAVE TO BE TEST BLIND
hello????? Who the hell does this help over test optional? I sure as hell am not helped even though im severely disadvantaged. I’ve been trying to take the SAT since mid sophomore year, exactly the time this pandemic fucking started. I’ve utilized many free tools and EVEN PAID for classes  on top of my responsibilities to potentially improve my score. guess that doesn’t matter to ucs anymoreeee.
 
2. APPLICANT INCREASE. First of all good job to everyone getting accepted into top colleges this year. Don’t listen to people saying yield rate to discourage you. BUT GOOD GOD WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THIS FUCKING COMPETITION. especially since ucs are test blind everyone’s rightfully taking their shot. how are ao’s going to differentiate applicants now? fit? what does that even mean? ARE THEY GONNA SEND A WHOLE ASS BUZZFEED PERSONALITY QUIZ TO FIND OUT WHAT HARRY POTTER HOUSE IM IN? maybe they will find out which office character I most resemble. in any case: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

3. ECs 
I have been told by reliable sources that ec’s and activities will have increased weightage in admissions for certain local schools I’m looking to apply to.     Well, since March of last year all my ec’s and activities have either been cancelled or seriously fell off. my school doesn’t even allow clubs or sports to function correctly or play on campus. See my problem? despite this I’m trying my best for some internship but at this point as you can tell I’m incredibly salty about the situation. 

4 and last. GPA
this pandemic has individually hit us all hard. This includes high school teachers. This has caused many of my (and my friends) teachers to perform substandard to their prepandemic level. Many of our classes have worse overall grades with mostly the cheaters improving their grades since the start of digital learning. Literally my calc teacher has to aid his young daughter with her learning disability and ends up being afk for half the period. this also translates to ap tests which a lot of us will have to “self-study” in order to get college credit.

Everyone that got in has my sincerest congratulations but in the next year we’re in for the most frustrating application process in modern history. God help us all."

I am a student at a state university in U.S. pursuing CS degree. I'm planning on graduating next summer, and I would like to hear you guys' opinions on various career routes and your personal interests.

For a little context, I did my first internship last Spring which I absolutely loved. I worked entirely on Angular 8, which was a perfect for me because most of my personal projects were made with React, and all the programming I did outside the school was almost entirely frontend, so I picked up Angular pretty quick. I had another internship last Fall with C++ scripts for a CLI, which I didn't like and don't see me doing it on long term.

Back to today, I'm looking to learn new things for my personal projects. Initially, I was planning on keep going onto Web Development route. My reasoning was that since I already have some web dev experience, I might as well delve deeper into it, making myself more hirable. Also I heard there are many jobs for web devs, so that's another reason. I was planning on learning .NET 5 to use as backend, Entity framework to query database and just use Angular for frontend.

This was the plan until a thought popped in my head ""is this what I REALLY want to do?"" This happened after a  phone call with a friend who recently got into VR. He seemed very excited about what he does and reminded me of why I took CS to begin with. Back in highschool, I started making small games like clicker games with visual basics, which led me to learn some programming, take Java class, which made me want to take CS for college. But for never once have I considered taking Game Dev route because I heard they are underpaid. Also I'm guessing that Unity isn't broadly used outside game companies, so maybe it will be hard to find a job next year... Despite this, I have learned that I cannot be happy if I don't feel connected to my job. So I am considering  switching my plan and learning Unity 3D instead of the web dev plan I mentioned.

So, to all of you guys out there, based on your experience, what would you do and why?

Also I'm still exploring career routes, so I'm not necessarily tied to these two routes. If you have any other suggestion on route or any of your passions, I'd love to hear from you.

And thank you for taking time to read this long post."

Currently completing my Junior year and will be a senior in college next year, and honestly I have no clue what I want to focus on after graduation. I've completed 2 internships so far, first was in automation, this job was nice but I didn't ever feel challenged at work and felt pretty mundane. Second internship was a big company where I did application development for their website, again the work was fun at times but not as challenging as I thought. Other then these two I have completed a few projects in mobile development, a bit of Computer Vision which I really really enjoyed, unfortunately though my GPA would not be good enough for graduate school. Other then this I worked on distributed computing a bit, that's where my main focus is however I've found that there is no ""easy"" way to dive into this or start, what I mean by this is I found a project I wanted to work on however unlike my other projects this one would take a while to complete maybe even 6 months +. I'm writing this to see how others choose their profession and what tools/research they to  did to pick their specific profession. Another question I have is as an example, after graduation if I were to land a job in automation how hard would it be to switch to distributed computing 1 year later or a bit of time later?"

Starting from this month I got a job in a company, that pays pretty high. We got only 70 employees, and the founder of the company is very active among us.

With me there are 11 other interns, within 6 months they will decide whether to hire us permanently. Even internship is pretty well paid if I get to be permanent it's double that.

Past few weeks my work performance was pretty good.

&gt;Today I had a meeting with the founder. Me and another two guys. Just a casual chat how things are, well I told how my past week have been.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the other went a little extra and asked a few questions about the company . For which the founder answered etc…  
&gt;  
&gt;That got me thinking, by asking a question it showed his interest in a topic founder was interested in.  
&gt;  
&gt;When he was about to ask me a question. The other guy interrupted with the question and the time was up, and he couldn't ask me anything.  
&gt;  
&gt;Which I was hoping he does, so I can tell him how I can use my skills to add value for the company.

Did I miss my shot at first impression?

I have some ideas, but I wonder, it might be stupid so let me.

1. We use Google chat for internal chat. What if I message him

""hey! I couldn't speak properly yesterday I was super anxious. I know you are super busy, but I would love to talk to you when you have time. I got many ideas which could add value for the company.""

Or mention the question he wanted to ask me?

2. Should I blend in with the other guy. Tell him that he did good, and ask him honestly did I botch up first impression? (aligning with the best few from my team)

These ideas might be stupid, If I am wrong correct me.

If you have any suggestions to improve my reputation at work let me know"

Here are the perks/concerns I organized about each program:

(1) MS in Information Management, UW iSchool

[Perks]
- Location - I personally love Seattle + close to Amazon and MS
- Research opportunities: established research groups
- I have several ppl currently going to UW I know who could guide me through (e.g., getting internships, research opportunities, school life)

[Concerns] 
- Curriculum: Although it does address data science, it is more focused on management (although there is flexibility to pursue data sci)
- No scholarship offered

(2) MS in Analytics, Georgia Tech

[Perks] 
- Curriculum focused on performing analytics
- TA Assistantship

[Concerns] 
- It is a one year program, I prefer programs that are 2 yrs

(3) U of M, MS Information

This could be a great opportunity for me to learn, because I never dealt with big code bases, all I did was some small projects. But thinking that I would work 7hours/day average on summer just overwhelms me, I think 7 hours would probably take out an entire day, no beach, no going out … maybe I'm exaggerating idk.

m6zos6,8,2021-03-17,How hard is it to find a job out of college (Mechanical Engineering)? Am I throwing away a great opportunity?,mrdoodlebutt,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/m6zos6/how_hard_is_it_to_find_a_job_out_of_college/,"TLDR; I'm just starting out in college for Mechanical Engineering. I have a design/mechanical engineering internship I'm doing right now. After the internship the pay will be low and my boss said I can work full/part time depending on my classes. The issue is my boss is incredibly difficult to work with and I'm not sure if the experience is worth it.  


I'm in a very unique situation. For the last 8 years I've had a hobby/interest in 3D printing and engineering. 6 years ago I decided/stumbled into that being an engineer is my life's goal/purpose. I didn't know how I would pay for school and I also had never been good at school (I later on in life got diagnosed with ADHD and life has been much better). So I decided to join Active Duty Air Force for four years. I worked IT (basic computer support, fixing computers, active directory, and a small amount of powershell/command, have a few IT certs) in the Air Force for 3 1/2 years. The DOD has a Skill Bridge program where a military member can be a free intern in a company to develop job skills so that the military member can transition out of the military and be a successful employed Vet quickly. I spread my resume around and I had one company reach out to me to say they were interested in having me as an intern and training me to be a junior mechanical engineer. Before the internship I told them about how I got accepted into going to school for Mechanical Engineering and if they were going to offer me a job after the internship I might have to work part time because school needed to come first. I would be paying for school with the GI bill and needed to keep my GPA up high enough (also the GI bill pays a monthly stipend so I don't actually need that much money due to me being a single bachelor living in an apartment with a roommate.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in the internship at this company for a little over a month now. They do specialized machine design for screen printing machines and big ovens with conveyors in them. The design team is super small (there's currently three of us including me). The lead designer is the owner of the company and I've found out he's incredibly difficult to work with. Sometimes he'll be trying to 'teach' me something and as I ask questions about it (I'm trying to learn more about it) he somehow takes offense to it and tells me I'm arguing with him. The best example I have of this is last Friday they didn't have anything for me to do at the end of the day so I was told I could just play in the CAD software and try to design something I'd want. I'm just moving into a new apartment and I currently don't have a computer desk. I do a lot of DIY projects and have built myself desks before so I thought I'd whip up something and price the materials (I would be paying for the materials and I have my own tools. The company has nothing to do with this project). As I was working on the wrap around desk I was about 90% complete with it when the boss comes over and looks at what I was doing. He first responded with ""You want to build that?!?! That will not be able to hold anything. It's so weak it will collapse as soon as you put anything on it."" He then proceeded to criticize and critique everything about the desk. ""It's not ergonomical and your legs wont fit there"" ""I can't believe you want to use X type of wood"" I tried to tell him I've built two desks like this before and I was very happy with them, but he insisted I wasn't and that he would draw a desk design for me and ""show me how to really design a desk."" He seemed to have a one track mind that the only way you could make a desk was the way he wanted to do it. I was 25% pissed off and 75% just bewildered about how this dude could care so much about my weekend DIY project and telling me how much he knew more than me about it. There have been other instances of that, but that one is the easiest to explain. I'll say the other engineer is a really cool dude and super easy to work with. The guy approaches teaching me things in a way I can easily understand and implement.  


Yesterday he apologized for how he acted last week and how much he's been criticizing me. I accepted his apology and he seemed more relaxed yesterday. I have three weeks left in this contract for the internship.  


I've been getting many calls about IT jobs in the area that pay, on average, 50% more than what he may offer following the internship (if I get a job offer). Although I'm hesitant to stay here due to how difficult the boss is to work with and I'm not sure if the apology is going to result in changed behavior or if it was just to keep me from walking out or something.  


I wanted to open the floor up to suggestions because If I can work here part/full time as I'm going through school that would give me a tremendous amount of job experience (I think about 3 years) by the time I actually earn my degree and it might be easier to move onto a different higher paying job that may be in a better environment. I don't know how difficult it is to get a job after getting a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering while only having IT experience (and a two month engineering  internship). Would I be throwing away a great engineering opportunity by moving back into the IT world? I'm just not sure what to do. Thank you for reading this far down."

I got along with the team and loved the work.  I was an intern and they were unable to hire me after the internship.  About 6-ish months later they offered me a part time role because someone was leaving.  I turned down an offer for a full time job to do this role because I knew I would be happier.  A couple months before co-vid hit, the full time version of my role became available.  They said they wanted me for the role, but per policy they have to advertise it and interview other employees who applied.  I sent in my application materials, and right away they said they wanted to set up an interview.  Months went by and they hadn’t actually scheduled the interview, I reminded them a few times and was told “we’re really busy and can’t do it now”

Then co-vid hit.  They were one of the first organizations in my area to shut down, and I was furloughed right away.  Over late spring, I was brought back on part time working from home.  I still enjoyed it, but struggled because I was doing the work of a full time employee but with part time hours.  I brought this up to my boss (who I had a great relationship with) that I either needed more hours to get the work done or higher pay.  As expected, she said they couldn’t do either and sent me a gentle nudge that I was going to get furloughed again soon.  

So that’s where I am now. Unemployed since September.  I still really want to work there and get that full time position that I was essentially promised.  I haven’t heard from anyone from my team in a while, but I saw that they just hired two important senior management roles in my department.  One made a comment that they will be growing the team.  I haven’t heard anything from anyone though.  Is this a sign that I’m not in their future plans and should just move on?

When is the best time to apply to prop trading firms and HF for summer internships?

Or rather, until when itsn't it too late?

Do I have significantly more chances of getting an offer if I apply as early as April 2021 or should I rather prep more and apply at the end of summer 2021?

I am in Europe.

Thank you guys!"

Advice?",root_bridge,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/m73glw/first_it_job_after_2_years_of_searching_feel_like/,"Graduated in 2018 with an AAS in Network Systems Management and in the meantime got my CCNA and A+. I had one internship as an IT Admin Assistant for a small 100-person company.  After two years, I've finally gotten a job as an IT Technician I position (to become IT II after 90 days). This is really small operation, just the owner and another tech. We do all sorts of IT services for small- to medium-size businesses. We work with a lot of Azure AD, O365, and ConnectWise, along with a handful of other things.

The interview with the owner went really well and he offered the job the next day, but he didn't really ask me a lot of technical questions during the interview. The story is he started off cabling and built his way up. The other tech is very knowledgeable, but came from a tech support background and has no certs or degrees.

I thought I'd be over the moon, but instead I'm sick to stomach. They are really nice and know I am not experienced, so are starting me off slowly. But I feel like the owner is making assumptions about me because of my education. Since it's a small operation, I will be expected to take on a lot. I will be expected to do a little bit of everything, and I am completely terrified. I feel like what I learned is either not relevant, obsolete, or forgotten. While the way the owner talks about me leads me to believe he thinks I can bring a lot of expertise to the business.

I did well in school (3.8 gpa), did okay on the CCNA (953), and decent on A+ ( can't remember my scores). I have a home lab and I'm always self-studying. But I have a 9-month old and my available time to study has been cut back.

I am more than willing to put forth the effort and growth needed to contribute. But I'm terrified I will disappoint and am afraid of asking questions. There's just so much for me to learn about their operations, and we don't have the big team for me to fake it until I make it.

**TL;DR**
 First IT job, don't know shit."

Under my leadership, my school's Congressional debate team has the most state qualifications in the city (last year we had 1 qualification).

National Hispanic Institute (9+10+11)**-** I volunteer to teach talented Hispanic youth public speaking skills. Specifically, I am one of the category leaders in Extemporaneous Speaking.

Furthermore, when I was a participant in NHI, I was State Champion for NHI in Extemporaneous Speaking.

Moreover, I organized a BLM rally with community leaders, high school students, and politicians that was covered by all local news outlets (11). I also volunteered for a local mayoral race over the summer mainly doing phone-banking (10+11). Finally, I am in NHS but just a general member.

**Internships/Work Experience**: I was an intern at a local economic development non-profit the summer after 9th grade. I was the youngest intern in company history and completed data sheets, researched data bases, organized meetings, met with community leaders and politicians, and I even met and attended a meeting with members of Congress.

I don't have internships or experience and was having a terrible time applying, I also failed to practice more than 10 leetcode easies. Additionally, despite having a great gpa from OSUpostbacc, I have never felt like a real programmer and get anxiety even thinking about landing a job. 

How did I get an offer? I applied on angelslist to every entry level webdev job I could find weekly since graduation in December. I only got a few interviews and was beginning to slow down, until I found a company with a realistic assignment of refactoring some JS. I spent all day doing it as it was so much nicer than taking a leetcode assessment, and the interviewer really liked my work! We talked about my react projects and he liked those as well! 

Just got off zoom with the CEO and they're giving me an offer (albeit it is pretty small) but I find it incredible. I have read about everyone's struggles, and was expecting to have a very long wait until finding an offer, but the stars have aligned for me. My advice is to make some decent projects with the stack you want to work with, mine was a react guitar fretboard note selection quiz which was pretty basic tbh, and then just keep applying everywhere. I had around a 1% interview rate with apps, but that turned into an offer. 

You never know what could happen if you keep your head up and lower your standards to startups and smaller starting salaries. My plan all along was to get a small company and get some experience before moving on in search of higher pay, and to be completely honest I have crippling imposter syndrome already."

1. How difficult is it with professor Hsieh? I will be taking 1 easy GE and 1 core engineering class alongside 180, apart from working 7-3 each day. Is that doable?
2. I hear the 72 hour final was brutal... is it really a 3-day event or can it be reasonably done in one day or so? You can imagine it would be impossible for me to take 3 days off to do a final, unless I save up my sick days or something.

I attended Community College ""A"" from 2015 to Spring 2019  soon after high school because it really seemed like the go-to option for me. I started  with Computer Science, then changed from my major education plan to Mechanical Engineering, to  Allied Health, and finally, the field of IT (Cybersecurity) with the intent to transfer to a 4 year eventually. It REALLY, ACTUALLY never occurred to me that deep of looking for an internship, as I was talking to the counselors, taking career personality quizzes, attending workshops, and so on to get a more clearer idea of what to do.

Then around 2018, I went to Community College ""B"" when I still figured to do an Allied Health major plan mainly because their physics classes were apparently 'better' at the time, and because this community college also offered vocational programs. After some thinking, I decided with a plan to transfer to the local 4 year college that's offering a B.S. in Information Systems with a Cybersecurity concentration, and that by the end of this spring 2021, I'll be getting an AA in Liberal Arts and a Web Application Security Support Specialist Certificate. I found cybersecurity interesting for me to decide to transfer to go with it after doing some research and such.

(Life).

I essentially  became way too indecisive,  and unfortunately being the person that I am, quiet and keeping to myself,  got too comfy while living with my parents while attending community college....while being in my room for the most part. And that back in 2018, my parents gave me a serious talk that they won't be around forever...so figure out something concrete now, which I more-or-less have now, I guess....and that I only started working in 2019 through a staffing agency, and so far up to now...my work history is pretty bad as they are all  short term...mostly of warehouse work, and was let go from my Home Depot Warehouse job a few months ago, because as much as I tried to, I went to simply tolerate it long enough to make my numbers look good, while looking for another job...but they beat me to it.

For other things,  I only have  a food handler certificate, volunteer experience from 2019, and a certificate of completion in doing a CISCO course due to a  class I took at Community College ""B"". I've never used my food handler certificate, and that I've been trying to apply for other different jobs other then warehouses, but it almost always ends up the places I applied at, say ""If you get picked, then you get picked"".

I blame myself for being...'complacent' and just really....god awfully dumb...of what I've done so far and the time I've wasted.... because I figured that as long as I kept going.......Well...nope....because that was really freaking STUPID......and that I've been struggling to get new habits and focus...on the things I REALLY need to do.....alongside in that I kept applying for jobs...and...  just called and called and sent emails.

I also even did plans to transfer back in fall 2019, but pretty...much...gave up......because of realizing how much I managed to do things for myself at that point....and that it'll take me like 2.5 years to get my B.S in 2023 with the classes I've done so far...when I'll be nearing 28 years old...or more...and I start in the fall, but deciding for a spring transfer maybe...

TLDR: Apathetic and anxious after attending two community colleges and taking too long what to do, finally decided....but filled with regrets and missed opportunities as I continuously enrolled without break until the summer of last year. Got too passive and flaky.....and feeling...a bit numb...of how my life has gone....

I did take some CS undergrad courses to get into OMSCS. This is only my first semester and I am taking IIS and SCS. I plan to take 1 in the summer and either 1 or 2 in the Fall. I also will probably use the month off in August to go through cs50 and leetcode. At what point would I be able to apply for jobs and not have my resume thrown out? Also would it be better to apply for internships for summer 2022?

m7egwy,27,2021-03-17,Landed my first job!,billygoat7777,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m7egwy/landed_my_first_job/,"I’ve been lurking here for a few months now as I’ve been job hunting the last several months and I finally landed a SWE position after a couple hundred applications. I’m super excited about it and I wanted to let those that are still hunting know that there is light at the end of the tunnel! 

A little bit about me, I graduated in May 2020 with a B.S. in CS and having just completed a 9 month internship at a large company. Due to the pandemic I was unable to convert that internship to a full time position and had little luck with other applications/ was so burnt out from remote school and my internship. So I took a small break and did some seasonal work for the summer while I slowly applied to more positions. Fall rolled around, the seasonal work ended and Since I have probably applied to close to 300+ jobs. After a handful of failed tech screens and a couple of different interviews,  I made it through 4 rounds for the position I accepted today. If at all possible leverage connections at the places you’re applying. friends, classmates, and alumni were all super helpful answering questions, or referring me to the recruiters. And ultimately just being myself and showing my passion and excitement for the field is what got me the offer. 

So for those still on the grind, you’ve got it, don’t give up, and keep on trying! You’ll get it!"

I am about to graduate this May and am thinking about working full time while getting my master's in Computer Science. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current internship wants to hire me full-time and will willing to reimburse my tuition. I would then have to work there for a full year after graduation if I do not want to pay them back. 

I just wanted to know how possible is it to take 2 classes a semester, aka finish in about 3 years, and work full-time. Will this be extremely difficult to manage? 

During my undergrad, I worked 20 hours a week at my internship, took 5 classes, and managed a student organization so I'm not unfamiliar with lots of work. Just want to make sure I'm in the right headspace really.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I'm a bit hesitant to accept due to the amount of workload I will have at the team. 

During my internship, I worked 12 hours every single day including weekends and still felt like it wasn't enough. I was getting calls and requests constantly in the evenings. The only break I had was really the time I sleep.  

As much as I want to work for the company, I'm not sure if I can sustain in the team I worked for. I was stressed out all the time and lost more than 10 lbs over my internships. I know working for this company at the team would be super beneficial for my career, but scared that I might have burn out too quickly. 

I am not sure what to do.  Also, would it look bad if I ask for a position for another team?"

m7jnx8,52,2021-03-18,Help!!!,IvarRagnarson825,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/m7jnx8/help/,"So I am in the fourth year from a tier 2 college and right now I have only one offer at a mass recruiter company Infosys. I don't know what to do next. My trajectory from the beginning was good, I did two paid internships at two mid-level startups as a Frontend Developer but I realized that I don't know shit about the things they ask in Tests and Tech Rounds i.e. Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Designs. 

At the same time, many of my friends got great packages of 12 Lakhs to 20 Lakhs in the FAANG level companies. This along with the workload I am getting at the Startup where I was working made me really depressed. Like my hairs started turning grey etc. Hence I left the job at that Startup in November 2020 and did nothing after that apart from exercising and focussing on my health but now after 4 months the reality hit me and it is giving me anxiety attacks. In these 4 months, I have applied for only 5 companies in which I have reached Tech Round in 2 of them but they rejected me after that.

I don't know what to do next as it is too late to start preparing from scratch( and I am still confused about the language to prepare in, till now I am solving questions in Python but most recruiters ask questions in Java and C++).

Second, if I start now how much time it would take to prepare for a good company which pays at least 7-8 Lakhs in-hand."

I’m graduating college in May and I haven’t had an internship and but have about 18 units of gis coursework. Most employers are looking for people with high school diplomas or associates degrees so I’m wondering if having a bachelors would give me an edge up. What’s the best thing for me to do as soon as I graduate?

&amp;#x200B;

I fell in love with programming as a teenager and went to college for computer science. I completed my Associates and transferred to a university to complete my Bachelors. Life happened (family/medical) and my education was put on hold. Many years later I ended up relocating and had to start work right away - not in field. Felt like I would never get back on track.

At the advice of a friend I attended a bootcamp, and completed it. I was provided an internship and managed to land one with great prospects for converting to full time. I love the company and the culture, and although the opportunity for more interesting/challenging work is there I am not super happy with the work I am doing at the moment.

The problem comes in that myself and other interns were never even considered in the budget for hiring (we are the first interns I am aware of this happened to). We were relayed that our internships were extended and they pinky promise we aren't being abused for cheap labor. All the while we get to listen every week to their hiring woes, and clap and welcome the newest person they managed to hire. It is honestly depressing, and feels like a slap in the face.

I have been spending every waking minute outside of work applying to jobs and am at 300+ so far, all of which have landed me 1 phone screen(declined to proceed further than this) and a take home (job posting was cancelled after submitting). Basically every rejection comes down to the fact that I don't have a Bachelors, and no company I have found considers internship real experience, regardless of the fact that I have been functioning as a full team member, contributing code that is going into production for over 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very aware of the difference in skill between myself and more seasoned engineers but I am not being given work that helps me grow in meaningful ways (95% of the work is SQL related).

&amp;#x200B;

The time crunch part comes down to that I have a child attending daycare now, and even with the most strict budgeting, only paying the bills + buying essential groceries, with the added cost of childcare we are bleeding multiple hundreds of dollars a month(coming from our house savings). We are watching our dream of homeowner ship dwindle away month by month, and each new rejection email that comes through, and each new hire at my current company just chips more and more away at my sanity.

I have no real network at this time. Just a friend that keeps assuring me ""it's a candidates market right now!"" and current coworkers. I have reached out to some I trust about referrals to other places but none are aware of any.

I know the ""its a numbers game"", ""work on your resume"", ""network more"", and I have been trying, but it is getting extremely disheartening.

&amp;#x200B;

I think what I feel is a mixture of rage and depression. I feel upset watching lesser skilled peers ( from bootcamp ) find jobs doing the same things I am. I feel upset of my experience being non-valued by companies. I feel upset that I am being taken advantage of by my current company.

That being said I feel like I am doing everything I am supposed to be doing, but I have no luck. I wasn't really ""stressed"" about it originally because I know it just takes time, but the added stress now of us being perpetually in the red financially every month and just tearing through our savings is really affecting me.

Any tips, suggestions, advice, or even reassurance is appreciated."

I'm a third year student studying in a Tier 3 College and I want a job as a Backend &amp; Cloud Engineer. Maybe a Full Stack Developer. I will start my final year around August and graduate in early 2022.

Given that I come from a tier 3 college, I'm definitely going to be applying to a lot of off-campus jobs in my final year since the companies that come to our college are not that great. I am reasonably confident about my chances of securing a job off-campus since I have a bunch of projects and am also currently working as a backend dev intern alongside studies and may try to get another internship in the near future.

As such, I would like some advice regarding when I should start applying. After graduation? 3 months before? 6 months before? tomorrow??

The reason I'm asking this early is because I have also considered going the Internship + PPO route if it's from a good company and wanted advice regarding that too. Is it feasible/recommended/popular? What are my chances of securing something like this in a good FAANG or Indian-FAANG level company given my track record? And when/where should I start applying to such internships?

I've realized for a while now how much I've screwed myself over considering that realistically speaking, all I could ever put on a resume is that I have an engineering degree with a 3.2 GPA...and that's about it. 

I haven't participated in any clubs/volunteering/extracurriculars whatsoever in my last 4 years as a student. No undergraduate research or internships. Absolutely nothing. I'm a nobody. I've never even had a ""regular job"" ever in my life. 

All I do from day to day is school work and video games. I do nothing during winter/summer breaks. I have no friends, no hobbies, or any sort of activities outside of that. I just sit on my ass all day, not even leaving the house for days. I do nothing and it has my parents concerned, and I honestly don't blame them.

I want to fix this issue and get a life. I've been in therapy for about the last year trying to work through some issues with extremely debilitating anxiety and depression, and I'm trying to better myself so I can just be a normal person and not always have awkward silences after someone asks me about my plans for the future or what I do/would like to do. Those issues contribute to me avoiding having a job up to this point (the idea of actually accomplishing this terrifies me cause I imagine myself in some kind of job having absolutely no idea what I'm doing since I've never worked for anyone before and just making a complete fool of myself), but I've also just been fortunate enough to have my parents take care of pretty much everything for me. It was very easy for me to get to this point. It's humiliating. I know its pathetic that I'm still at this stage despite how old I am, and that I should've grown up some time in high school. But I really do want to go down the right path and turn things around for myself. I just feel like I've run out of time and completely screwed myself forever. I also just...dont know anything about any of this considering I have no experience with getting a job.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix this. I don't even have a clue about what kind of industry/field I'd like to go into, but honestly that's way too far ahead for me considering I need to at least have ANY work experience before I can even think about a career. Or at least that's what I'm assuming.

Please help me out here. What can I do this summer (and obviously down the line) that would help me to turn this around ASAP? Should I try and shoot for just some kind of random service job to at least have SOMETHING, or should I focus more on things that would be relevant to what I'm studying. I'm assuming getting any kind of job/internship is going to be difficult until I at least do something first, so should I instead focus on something else? I'm completely lost here and I'm just trying to push myself beyond what my stupid mental issues have allowed me to do up to this point in my life, so that itself is gonna be a huge challenge when making this change but I know I need this change to happen no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate any sort of guidance/advice on this issue. Sorry if this post is vague but I'm not really able to give any sort of specific details considering I've done nothing with my life in the first place. It's a very uneventful crisis. So I guess this is just a general topic that I'm posting and I'm open to whatever any kind of response I get. If I could get literally anything remotely positive out of this post I would be very grateful."

m7puw1,2,2021-03-18,Career advice - is this a crazy idea?,_fudge,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/m7puw1/career_advice_is_this_a_crazy_idea/,"(Feel free to skip the context and jump to the question - bottom paragraph)

Okay, so for context I have had two jobs in my life. I started working at McDonald's at the age of 17 when I was attending college. I was encouraged to apply for this job by my family. It was difficult at the time because I would often struggle with studying and attending classes for my A-levels and then have to rush off to work to do a shift. After finishing college with average to poor results (3\*C A-levels). I didn't have much vision with what I wanted to do with my life and was apprehensive about jumping into university for a number of reasons. So I continued to work at McDonalds working all sorts of crazy shifts getting paid next to nothing (started on £4.15 an hour going to £6 an hour).

I decided I had enough of that, so I decided on a university degree I wanted to study, computing/computer science (because I studied computing at A-level and I thought I could become a super competent and passionate programmer). Anyway, after starting I realised that the course really wasn't going into the depth that I wanted and that no one really cared about studying just partying (which I guess I'm boring so not that interested in). I made a couple of friends which was the only reason I really stuck with the course. However, I really did want to get out and do something else, so I applied to an internship with a few companies. One of the companies was a large defence company which I really didn't expect to get far with, as it is known that they only take the best and brightest candidates. Anywho, for some strange reason they decided I was qualified and gave me a job as an intern. I completed my internship in another part of the country away from home. It was okay, though the days really dragged out working in an office, I often felt I was trying to justify being there a lot. I think it's at this part I realised the challenges of programming in a large working environment where everyone else is much more competent than me.

After my internship they gave me an offer to return to the company with a bursary (basically free money) for finishing my university degree. I did finish my degree, there was a lot of stress which I don't think was helped by the pandemic forcing me to complete my dissertation at home. I didn't have much motivation to go back to work for the same company again but I was swayed by the bursary and them reaching out to me and setting the ball rolling with getting me back by setting up interviews etc.

So I started working with perhaps not the best mentality (though this is something I've always struggled with - perhaps partly due to anxiety) in a job unrelated to what I studied at university or what I did in my internship. I was working in what I would basically call human resourcing for the IT sector of the business. This role didn't interest me that much. I often had to join calls with people who are heads of department and work out their future resourcing demands. This wasn't what I studied for and I knew I wasn't interested in it. So after several months of doing this my manager asked if I wanted a transfer to another sector of the business. I accepted and I managed to arrange an interview to join another team in my sector of the business. I was accepted for the role and that's where I'm working at the moment. I'm now back to programming, but working in an agile environment, however I'm really struggling with it. Every morning we have to discuss what we're doing for the day, I hate doing this as I often feel like I don't have as much work as other people discussing what it is they're doing. So sometimes I avoid attending these meetings, like I may just clock in at 9:30 or something. I've also come to realise that I really struggle with what I do and considering how long I've been doing it for and how much better everyone else is than me it really upsets me.

So as for the matter of the title: I have recently seen a job posted online. A simple cleaning job. £8.70 an hour working part time: 4pm-8pm Monday-Friday. For whatever reason I see a job like this and it appeals to me. However, am I crazy for giving up a well paying job in a very respectable company for a part time job cleaning offices? Would I even get this job? Would I be overqualified? Would this be suicidal for my future? Am I just taking a grass is always greener mentality? I'm not sure."

I am currently a Y3 poly student (M) doing my internship. I am a culinary student doing an internship to quite a big food group. Its been only 3 days and basically everyday  i pretty much hide in the toilet to cry.

on the first day basically was the best day of the three days. There wasn't any introduction to the team or to the kitchen so the whole day was basically spent familiarizing myself with the place. i was assigned to the saucier/garnish station which has a tremendous work load. I was attached to a chef (but he wasn't the one in charge of the internship). The day went fine as throughout service i was just trying to memorize and write down the component's of the dish.  the chefs were nice and tried to explain everything they did to me and answered any of my questions nicely. dinner service was not especially busy so it was alright. thus i ended they 13 hour work day with 3 hour rest in between.

The second day was a lot tougher. The chefs expected a lot out of me this time. made many mistakes and the chef would say if i dont know anything just ask, but when i did ask some answers would be met with sarcastic remarks which kills my own confidence. The prep before hand i was constantly having sarcastic remarks thrown at me for doing my work too slow and being constantly reminded of how slow i am. lunch service came and i was just responsible for taking the different components the chef. the surprising part is that the chef actually tried letting me run the station on my own on the second day. as you would expect from an intern who has never worked in a professional kitchen before i messed up. the chef was there ready to help but would push me off the station. before dinner service is where i would cry for the first time. After the break, i figured i would try to get a head start on prep so i did. i had to prepare onion soup and some mash. I took about 30 minutes to get it all done. the chef then went up beside me and scolded me. He said that it took me 30 whole minutes to prepare the items when i could've done it faster and he could have done more things in 30 minutes than me. He then proceeded to give me a ""talk"" stating that if i wanted to do all the grunt work he could give me all the grunt work and that if i am not serious about my learning i should just quit. he said that with my half assed attitude there is simply no point with me being in the kitchen. he told me that he is being harsh but he had it harsher back in the day. I didnt think this was fair at all because i am truly giving it my all but it doesnt matter to them because they do not see any of that. i was basically in tears when he told me all this but i held it in until the end of service where i went to the toilet and just cried.

On the third day i was already contemplating if being in the kitchen was really for me. during service the chef was really more hands off and basically expected me to memorize everything in that station.  he also let me handle most of the station during the lunch service. some thing i  made mistakes got scolded and just let the stress got to me and after lunch service i went to the toilet to cry again and stayed there for about 1/2 my break time before i calmed down. For dinner service i was told that i would have the station to myself as there was only 4 chefs on duty. i felt like i handled the first two orders well as they came slow. But soon there was many orders to do and i couldn't keep up. at the same time of handling the orders i had to prep vegetables as well. during service i could not keep up with the orders and the chef had to jump in to help as well. because my station had appetizers and mains to do i had like 3-4 orders at the same time and each order had anywhere from 1 to 4 components. when i had asked the chef to help me out with some of the orders he said why cant you do it yourself. and when i inevitably messed up he would basically push me off the station which makes me feel grossly incompetent. the infuriating thing was that before service i had told the chef in charge of my intern that i was not comfortable handling the station myself. he basically gave me a talk saying that we are a family and you have to be dependable and that if i am not going to start now then when am i going to start. i just feel that this kind of stress and workload is not something you would give your 3 day old intern. Back to service i forgot 1 component to a dish and got scolded badly. this time i just could not held it in and cried silently in my station. the chef was coming up to scold me again for preping some baby carrots wrongly, but saw me crying and told me to have a 10 minute break. I went to the toilet again and just wept.

im basically second guessing every decision i made up to this point of my life and just doubting myself at every step of the way. Cooking is my passion but this is the first time i have stepped into a professional kitchen and the stress i have felt in this three days is just unbelievable. and to think that i have another 5+ whole months ahead of me. i am going to work for 6 days a week this week with each day starting from 930 and ending somewhere around 10 (with breaks). i just don't see myself doing this for long and honestly i just don't have it in me. im thinking of dropping out entirely but i dont know where to go after this. all i have left with me is my o'level cert which L1R4 is 16 points. i don't know what to do anymore. is it normal what i am going through? am i just being a huge baby about this? do lmk.........

Im sorry for this post being long but i just feel really stressed ngl i have also struggled with my mental health but i dont have any close friends i can confide in and therapy is expensive(idw my parents to know) i just feel extremely stressed :( 

TLDR

Started my internship was given enormous responsibility from the start and i cant handle the stress. I don't see myself doing this anymore and im thinking of dropping out but i don't know where i could go"

Another alternative is getting a general BA which I would qualify for now. The question is should I leave my job to finish the CS degree?

Note: the 4 CS classes would need to be done in person.

My concerns about not finishing my degree:

\- US visa (I'm Canadian and would like the option to work in the US).

\- Job eligibility (I know some/most companies require a relevant degree).

\- Regret. I feel like I've given up on something I've already committed so much time and energy.

My concerns about leaving my job:

\- Not being able to find a job after I'm done school.

\- Lost time (4 - 8 months depending if I do some classes part time).

on the first day basically was the best day of the three days. There wasn't any introduction to the team or to the kitchen so the whole day was basically spent familiarizing myself with the place. i was assigned to the saucier/garnish station which has a tremendous work load. I was attached to a chef (but he wasn't the one in charge of the internship). The day went fine as throughout service i was just trying to memorize and write down the component's of the dish. the chefs were nice and tried to explain everything they did to me and answered any of my questions nicely. dinner service was not especially busy so it was alright. thus i ended they 13 hour work day with 3 hour rest in between.

The second day was a lot tougher. The chefs expected a lot out of me this time. made many mistakes and the chef would say if i dont know anything just ask, but when i did ask some answers would be met with sarcastic remarks which kills my own confidence. The prep before hand i was constantly having sarcastic remarks thrown at me for doing my work too slow and being constantly reminded of how slow i am. lunch service came and i was just responsible for taking the different components the chef. the surprising part is that the chef actually tried letting me run the station on my own on the second day. as you would expect from an intern who has never worked in a professional kitchen before i messed up. the chef was there ready to help but would push me off the station. before dinner service is where i would cry for the first time. After the break, i figured i would try to get a head start on prep so i did. i had to prepare onion soup and some mash. I took about 30 minutes to get it all done. the chef then went up beside me and scolded me. He said that it took me 30 whole minutes to prepare the items when i could've done it faster and he could have done more things in 30 minutes than me. He then proceeded to give me a ""talk"" stating that if i wanted to do all the grunt work he could give me all the grunt work and that if i am not serious about my learning i should just quit. he said that with my half assed attitude there is simply no point with me being in the kitchen. he told me that he is being harsh but he had it harsher back in the day. I didnt think this was fair at all because i am truly giving it my all but it doesnt matter to them because they do not see any of that. i was basically in tears when he told me all this but i held it in until the end of service where i went to the toilet and just cried.

On the third day i was already contemplating if being in the kitchen was really for me. during service the chef was really more hands off and basically expected me to memorize everything in that station. he also let me handle most of the station during the lunch service. some thing i made mistakes got scolded and just let the stress got to me and after lunch service i went to the toilet to cry again and stayed there for about 1/2 my break time before i calmed down. For dinner service i was told that i would have the station to myself as there was only 4 chefs on duty. i felt like i handled the first two orders well as they came slow. But soon there was many orders to do and i couldn't keep up. at the same time of handling the orders i had to prep vegetables as well. during service i could not keep up with the orders and the chef had to jump in to help as well. because my station had appetizers and mains to do i had like 3-4 orders at the same time and each order had anywhere from 1 to 4 components. when i had asked the chef to help me out with some of the orders he said why cant you do it yourself. and when i inevitably messed up he would basically push me off the station which makes me feel grossly incompetent. the infuriating thing was that before service i had told the chef in charge of my intern that i was not comfortable handling the station myself. he basically gave me a talk saying that we are a family and you have to be dependable and that if i am not going to start now then when am i going to start. i just feel that this kind of stress and workload is not something you would give your 3 day old intern. Back to service i forgot 1 component to a dish and got scolded badly. this time i just could not held it in and cried silently in my station. the chef was coming up to scold me again for preping some baby carrots wrongly, but saw me crying and told me to have a 10 minute break. I went to the toilet again and just wept.

im basically second guessing every decision i made up to this point of my life and just doubting myself at every step of the way. Cooking is my passion but this is the first time i have stepped into a professional kitchen and the stress i have felt in this three days is just unbelievable. and to think that i have another 5+ whole months ahead of me. i am going to work for 6 days a week this week with each day starting from 930 and ending somewhere around 10 (with breaks). i just don't see myself doing this for long and honestly i just don't have it in me. im thinking of dropping out entirely but i dont know where to go after this. all i have left with me is my o'level cert which L1R4 is 16 points. i don't know what to do anymore. is it normal what i am going through? am i just being a huge baby about this? do lmk.........

Im sorry for this post being long but i just feel really stressed ngl i have also struggled with my mental health but i dont have any close friends i can confide in and therapy is expensive (idw my parents to know) i just feel extremely stressed :(

TLDR

Started my internship was given enormous responsibility from the start and i cant handle the stress. I don't see myself doing this anymore and im thinking of dropping out but i don't know where i could go

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE

ive since spoken to my LO and decided it was best for me to differ my internship to sem 4.1 thanks everyone for your kind words :p"

I secured my internship at Amazon starting in fall, yay. However, I already feel like an imposter. I really don't know how I got it, but to understand, here is my background. I am not looking for consolidation but rather for your experiences and especially for your input on how to improve before my internship. So here we go:

Finished my undergrad in business studies, wasn't happy. Started to study applied computer science for two semesters (undergrad) but due to Corona wasn't really happy there anymore and also having the perspective of having another 5+ semesters undergrad + 4 semesters postgrad until I finish was just out of the range. However, I finished all the courses and was also quite good at it. Now I study Business Information Technology, so a mixture of CS and business studies, which doesn't really focus on programming though (only little). 

I went through the regular Amazon SWE intern process, 7 debugging questions, 2 coding problems, from which one worked well and the other I totally crashed it :( and the virtual working simulation. Then another location (not the one which I applied to) reached out to me for interviews.

The first interview went well expect for the coding part - I really struggled with that one. The second went really well, also the coding part was great and I provided a good solution. I feel however, that I was just really lucky with my questions in the interview (can hardly do a leetcode medium question). Additionally, I never did any real projects except for uni work, which were really small exercises with a maximum of 5 classes or so. So to put it into a nutshell: **I have no idea how I landed this internship and do not understand, why they picked me!**

So to sum it up: I fell like I am going to fail bigtime. Are there any projects you'd recommend me to work on before or any other things to prepare for my internship? How did you guys overcome your imposter syndrome and how did you prepare for your internships?"

My last two semesters only took one core class and allowed me have easy load, search for job,intern during school, and generally more freedom last year. 
Do the hard work at the start and relax at the end. From an engineering major.


Sidenote:capstone/senior design you can normally take if you meet pre-req took my junior year instead senior.


Edit:Like many others mentioned only do this if you know what you want to do before going in. I do suggest though at minimum if you can try make your last two semesters as easy as possible , upper level electives, senior design projects, plus the stress of job search kills everyone most people struggle manage senior year. (Especially learned this my junior year, hardest year basically taking all my tough classes on top of covid intern job search). This advice vary person to person just wanted give different perspective as for me the amount of time opened up senior year to pursue personal endeavors and work ethic skills developed from the hard workload helped me to achieve my college and career goals."

I feel unsure and doubtful of myself **all the time**.

Objectively speaking, I am doing okay in life-

Work- my degree is very employable and so I won't have a problem finding a job. I also have a few internship experiences in reputable companies and leadership roles in good university societies which help my chances. I went to good schools where I learn a lot from respectful teachers and professors, so I had a good academic life in general.

Social- I am socially okay- I like spending time alone and with people, so I find a balance. For an introverted person, I am okay with talking to people and I think I am lucky to have good people around me. (Family, friends, even colleagues) I don't think I ever had a really bad conflict with someone in my life so far. I was blessed with a pretty good family- my parents have high standards because my older brother is a high flier, but they are fair people and they encourage me in whatever endeavors I embark on.

Looks- I believe looks aren't everything but still important. I am not the most gorgeous person out there, but I am definitely not ugly- in fact, I have heard from several people that I am ""intimidating because I am pretty"". Some of my guy friends imply that I have an easy life because I am a ""pretty girl"". I turn heads when I walk into a new venue and strangers are generally nice to me so I assume I can't be that unpleasant to the eye. I don't think I'm pretty- when I see the mirror, I see my flaws- but I am tall and I guess, well, not ugly.

The problem is, I always feel like an imposter who is lacking and just waiting for her flaws to be exposed. I can't trust the compliments people tell me from good heart, and I don't like myself for that. When people tell me I'm doing well or is pretty or popular or something like that, I just ignore that part of the conversation or overly deny it, making the person uncomfortable. The thing is, I think I do work hard to hear these compliments and like hearing them. I just don't know if I deserve these words because, well, in my eyes I fail numerous times and could be better in every aspect of life.

I have had some people telling me I don't look happy when something good happened to me (e.g. I got good grades/internship/ etc.) and it is somewhat true. When I have good news, I am happy for a few hours, bubbly, then my mood sinks as I start thinking about the next problem I need to start dealing with now. When something bad happens, I beat myself up more than others and it makes me sad that I am treating myself so harshly. If this exact same thing happened to a friend, I won't be seeing her as a failure at all- I would be sorry for her and tell her something even better would happen instead- and I would mean it. But when it comes to me, I beat the crap out of myself, and I think it's so unhealthy but I can't stop.

What is wrong with me? I always feel like the good things that happen to me are purely because of luck while the bad things are 100% my fault. I want to be gentler to myself but I have no idea how.

I want to truly feel okay. What should I do?"

as the saying goes curiosity killed the cat, and my curiosity led me to asking my parents what are their plans for the payment of my universities; which subsequently led to a rather disappointing answer of, ***""you will have to take out some loans""***

of course i was astounded, yes i know i am not wealthy, well off, or even close to privilege and that is why i made sure to not ask my parents for anything growing up. First computer, i payed for that 3 months ago, broken phone screen i paid for that 2 months ago, job- I've been working at one for over a year now.  
my own will to go out to movies, i am not allowed, parties, forget about it, and having friends- must be joke. As a result i would think when that magical number of ""18"" came about i would be able to experience not only freedom but happiness, yet no.   
my birthday is coming about, what that entails, I'm not sure anymore but what i do have on my mind is student debt.   


i never really had a problem with paying loans, or debts, i never had any. I supposed now that i am faced with the reality that i am moving to a foreign country by myself, paying for an apartment or dorm by myself, an education by myself. Am expected to keep my grades up- by myself, work a job to be able to afford food - by myself, do internships - by myself, i just think can i do it, is it worth it?  


The question of prestige, ranks, location and so on, does that beat price? I was never, and I do not think i will ever be smart enough to get a full ride to any institution, rather i was smart enough to get scholarships, win awards, trying my best.   


The point of my rambling i suppose is to speak my fears- rather write them into existence. 

**The feeling** *of being alone*   
**The feeling** *of not knowing if your decision is the right decision*   
**The feeling** *of fear*  
*just fear*

*I wonder if this college thing is truly right for me, yes it my dream, aspiration and so on, but in reality is it... Do i need to attend this institution so that i may be able to succeed in life, do i need to continue with most likely trapping myself in 30 years of debt, do i really need to do any of this.*

At the end of the day, well at the end of today i can only tell myself, i will wait until i have all of my decisions so that i can make that decision, that it will work itself out, all i need to focus on is my grades and my happiness, i hope i can continue telling myself that 5 months into the future, 2 years into the future, and 40 years into the future no matter what path i choose to take."

Firstly, I'm in my third year of engineering doing my major in Mech and minor in CSE (a feature my college offers), from a T1 college. I am a fairly competent developer and already have a two month unpaid web dev internship under my belt.

I got an internship offer from this startup called Settyl, Applied through the [Internshala Link ](https://internshala.com/internship/detail/full-stack-development-work-from-home-job-internship-at-settyl1615401012?utm_source=app_share&amp;referral=app_share). 

Now the thing is, they want me to work part time 3 hours on the weekdays and 6 hours on the weekends for 4k a month. I cant find this company on Google and they don't have a linked in page either. 

Should I take the job and gain some experience or work on my DS/ DAA and prep for college placements which will take place in Oct/ Nov.

Thanks!"

I'm 23 years old. I graduated in May 2020, and ever since then, I've been struggling to find a job. COVID-19 is not helping. I had a job before getting unemployed April 2020 due to the company not having enough money to pay any of their workers and closing business. Internships and jobs I was interested in before the pandemic all got canceled. I expected to go to grad school for a master's degree in late 2020, but had to defer because of financial circumstances. I'm close to being unemployed almost for a year.

Since this past year, I think I've applied to almost a thousand jobs now, and none of them resulted in anything. I've applied to jobs related to my field and all the way to retail jobs. I have medical conditions that would make catching COVID-19 dangerous to me, and been trying to apply to mainly remote jobs. I gotten a few interviews, but none of them resulted in anything either.

I had to move back to my parents' house almost a year ago to save money. Me and my parents do not get along at all. They shame me, are transphobic and homophobic to me, not supportive of my interests in art, sometimes starve me, they have daily arguments, and verbal abuse. They keep me here out of a sense of obligation from their culture and beliefs. They're immigrants in the lower middle class, so financial help from them is nil. My mental health has been continuously going down the drain ever since getting stuck in that house. I feel constantly tired despite wanting to do anything to get a job to hopefully get out of there. My ability to afford seeing my therapist is going to run out at some point.

My bachelor's degree feels worthless. I majored in art. I was one of the people that went with ""follow your passion"" in college. I wanted to become an animator with illustration on the side, I've wanted that since I was a child, but nobody is hiring me for animation or illustration right now. I do art commissions on the side, but I barely get enough people commissioning me nowadays, and it's not enough money earned to be a living wage. No matter how many art jobs from companies I applied to, I couldn't get anywhere.

My only other passion is parrot ornithology, but it's such an obscure subject. I minored in biology in college, but found that I have trouble with math and chemistry. I also learned from some ornithologists that the field doesn't pay very well unless you strike gold, and there is high competition. I can't volunteer at a bird rescue right now because of the pandemic. I can't volunteer at regular animal shelters because I have an allergy to most mammalian fur, dander, and saliva that's made severe with my asthma.

I have asperger's/high-functioning autism, so my networking isn't expansive as someone who is neurotypical. I don't have any connections with people from my hometown. I was bullied a lot before college, and had even heavier depression back then. My only connections have been during college and past college.

10 years ago, when I was younger during a very low point in my life, I told myself that I would prove the world wrong, and succeed in my life. My only friends at the time were my two birds before I lost them. I made a promise and a wish to myself that a decade later, my life will get significantly better, that I will move out to somewhere far away from my parents with my birds. I dreamed that I will become an animator that lives in a suburb of San Francisco in a small, humble house with his parrots. 

It was a silly dream that would never come true. I wouldn't have achieved it in 10 years. My parrots passed away. I'm stuck in my parents' house with no job, and moving to San Francisco on the other side of the US feels so far out of the ballpark. I still chase after the same dream with steadfast desire, but with a partner and future adopted parrots instead. Sometimes I wonder if I'm chasing after an impossible dream.

The only things that keep me going these days are my loving boyfriend, my supportive college friends, and the drive to keep chasing my dreams no matter how crazy they seem. I want to cry sometimes because of how hard the past year has been with finding a job. No matter how much I've done in the past decade with trying to get a better life, I'm back down to square one. I feel like I will be stuck here forever or at least for a long time. I need a job, and I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm at my wit's end."

My resume is very internship dominated with selective companies (top quant firm, Autonomous vehicles unicorn, and FAANG/Big N companies), I’m worried that MS programs will look past all my experiences in internships and clubs and just see my lack of competitive grades and research.

However, I'm super nervous about filling the application form because a small part of me feels like it would be a mistake to even though I legitimately do not enjoy being in ECE (I'm in second year currently so if my transfer is accepted I would be starting from second year Indy in the fall).

If anyone has switched into Indy or are currently in Indy how do you guys like the program? What kind of internships and PEY positions have you guys had? Also, how high does your GPA have to be to switch (again I'm nearing the end of my second year of ECE and it lowkey dropped a bit lol)? Any general advice about being in Industrial Engineering at UofT? How do the streams after second year work, I know there are 4 (OR, artificial intelligence/machine learning, HF, information engineering) but do you have to specialize in one of them or can you take courses from multiple streams?

I would appreciate any advice right now because I've been super stressed about making a final decision. Personally a lot of my career goals align with what is taught to Indy's and looking at the courses they take, I know I would enjoy being in those classes a lot more, but I still am nervous to take that final step. Just in case I do get these sorts of comments, I do understand that ECE becomes ""better"" after second year but I am not even remotely excited or interested about any of the courses offered for third and fourth year but because it is a really good program I don't want to regret transferring (if that makes sense)."

&amp;#x200B;

I moved into an apartment with my partner of 1.5 years. We both are pursuing law degrees at the same institution. There was no coercion from one party or the other - we both wanted to be on the east coast, we both wanted to be lawyers, we both wanted to move here and do this crazy thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward past my first semester. I get straight C's. I'm thinking, great! I passed! I'm going to really kick it up a notch and get my GPA up for the summer internships and all that. I finally have a functional laptop, and my files will actual submit properly and I can attend class reliably over Zoom.

&amp;#x200B;

The week before the semester starts, the school tells me that I missed the GPA requirement by 0.01 points. Yes. 0.01. Meaning if any number of the papers I wrote (that subsequently had issues because of my laptop) had been fine, I wouldn't have ever been on academic probation. I was devastated. I *am* devastated. I've been clawing tooth and nail through classes, study sessions, and office hours. I got a raw score of 82 on my crim law midterm, so I'd like to think that it's been paying off. 

&amp;#x200B;

A professor recently told me that my paper (we had to turn in one part of our long essay) was basically unusable. Why? Because I didn't cite enough cases. She says she doesn't think it's possible for me to get my GPA up high enough to be reinstated at the school. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner dumped me suddenly because he thinks my future is too unstable. Outside of some relationship issues, which were well within the scope of most people's relationship issues, we were great. Only fought like once a month, and things were back to being great. We even got a cat together. And now he is leaving me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, we still have to live together. The lease ends in September, and it's mid-March now. Neither of us have the funds to double our rent. We have friends here, but none of them are really able to make room for one of us for longer than a night at a time. Outside of the two friends I met through him, I have three others. One has COVID and is moving into a new studio apartment (can't room together). One just moved back home for treatment. The third is living in a much more expensive situation and he has a girlfriend - the last thing I want to do is make things uncomfortable, and my rent would be the same as if I were living alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm here, failing law school, in a pandemic, unable to get a decent legal internship, living with my ex for the next few months at least, with my cat.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm wondering if I should move back home or stay. I love the city but it no longer feels like I have anything keeping me here. Yet, I'd feel like a gigantic failure for moving home. I know if I moved home, I would see friends and family again, and probably have better job prospects, but I feel stifled in my childhood home having been to undergrad and now a completely different state. I have my BA in English and originally wanted to be a teacher, and that's currently my backup plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I stay where I'm at, I have to pay for rent, which is very expensive where I'm at. If I make it back into school, I'm not even sure if I *should*. I'm paying tens of thousands of dollars to go there, and I'm not doing the best. I do enjoy the material - property law has actually been really interesting and I'd consider doing it on the side of my intended practice area, immigration. But I didn't know how to write exam answers in my first semester, and so my grades suffered. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so lost and alone right now. I don't know what to do, but it comes down to two things: either I stay or I go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you all."

I found out about the opportunity in India through family living there, and seems to be a decent one, but I’m not sure if it will look as valuable to future employers as an internship in my state. This will be my first internship to add to my resume as well. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I’m completely lost on which would be a better option for my future career. Thank you"

I'm in the second year of my bachelor degree in computer science, and I feel extremely lost. I used to kinda enjoy coding upto 10th standard. I even made it into a pretty good college (which is like the 70th best engineering college in my country), but-

I just turned 20 yesterday, but the thought of wageslaving makes me feel sick to my stomach. I still find this field really fascinating, but whenever I see people around me doing so much, I feel so depressed and overwhelmed. I kinda like data structures and algorithms, I'm really into automata and formal grammars and stuff, and I binge watch Computerphile videos in my free time but I don't really like competitive coding, and I haven't done a single line of web development in my life. Even my grades are kinda below average (8.25/10). The pandemic has only made things worse. Is it too late for me?

Any suggestions for me? I do want to learn new skills, but I can't motivate myself. Also is getting an internship really important?"
m806ed,1,2021-03-18,Decent job vs. Top-tier school,nsktrombone84,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m806ed/decent_job_vs_toptier_school/,"I recently had the good fortune to have two “offers” simultaneously, and I’m hoping for some perspective from people in the industry before I make any final decisions. 

1. I was told recently by my boss at the company at which I currently intern that they like the work I’m doing and will likely want to convert me to full-time within the next month. I don’t know much about the offer yet, but I think it will be in the $60k range base, and I live in a LCoL area. It’s a decent-sized company and I like the people, but I know that this work is likely not what I’d want to do for the rest of my life. Plus, the tech stack is not something that is very common, so making shifts to other SE jobs down the road might be challenging, I believe (although I would appreciate seasoned perspective on this). If I get accepted to the Georgia Tech OMSCS program, I’d likely do that while I work, as well.

2. I was also offered admission to the Carnegie Mellon University MSE program. I would have to foot the rather large bill and live away from the family for roughly a year and a half, but I’m fairly confident that I could secure a higher-paying job with a tech stack I would enjoy more coming out of that program. The downside, aside from the family considerations, would be not being able to work while I study, so living off of loans &amp; savings. 

I realize no one can make this decision for me, but some insight into some things might really go a long way in helping me clarify my choices:

- If I work as a C# developer for a few years, as an example, how hard would it be to shift into an SE role with a different tech stack? I would likely spend the time supplementing those years with side projects related to the stack I’m interested in.

- In the job hunt, would 2-3 years experience + OMSCS masters carry more or less weight than a second internship at a large company + masters from CMU? (CMU requires a summer internship, and they’re usually at well-known companies).

- One other consideration is that I’d eventually like to relocate my family to somewhere besides where we currently live (ideally, the Seattle area or somewhere on the west coast). Would only having job experience in a less “tech” city make a difference when applying for jobs in other states/areas?

Thank you, in advance, for reading this far and for your input."

I'm a CS student in his 4th semester of my bachelor degree. What skills should I work on developing? So far, all I practically did was study my college curriculum (stuff like logic design, some basic data structures and algorithms, computer organisation and architecture). 

What extra should I learn to get an internship by the end of say my 6th semester? Also is it really necessary to get an internship in your college life? I hope it's not too late for me."

I am a junior CS student currently in a State school. I have been applying to internships since September, every week an application. So far got no “yes” answers. Is that a red flag, i.e something is wrong with my resume or it’s quite normal? I am pretty ok compared to everyone else.  I am ahead of several classmates who I regularly help with their classes, yet they already got interviews lined up. I am not sure what to do. Any advice?
P.S: Is anyone in a similar situation?


UPDATE: I went ahead and asked people on SE Discord to take a look at my resume. As the result changed my resume completely. Unrelated to that, just this week I got 4 interview offers for part time SE jobs and internships. 
Good luck to everyone, never give up!"
m8291y,4,2021-03-18,I had some questions regarding the software engineer apprenticeship,Electric_Toothbrsh,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/m8291y/i_had_some_questions_regarding_the_software/,"I applied to the position in Austin TX about 3 days ago, I was curious about what my chances are of actually getting accepted and what to expect for the hiring process and what the pay normally is for an apprenticeship and if it is actually beneficial to me having a successful career change.

   I started programing when I was 16 I'm 21 now I never thought about doing it professionally I just learned as a hobby  about 2 years ago I decided I wanted a career change and I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I landed a low paying job for a small business as a website admin (using wordpress) and handling networking. I did that for 1 year and a half before that business shut down due to covid-19, I started learning as much as I can since then and tried to get into freelancing with very inconsistent work. I know a basic level of python and PHP and I dedicate 40-80 hours a week to building projects trying to freelance and learning. I came across the apprenticeship and my goal I set 2 years ago was I want a job working for IBM or Google by the time in 25 as a software engineer with no college degree. I'm really relying heavily that I can get accepted am I the type of person they are looking for? And how much competition is there to get in? 
  
  How is the hiring process? I know there's tests and multiple interviews has covid-19 possibly changed anything and what should I expect specifically for the software engineer apprenticeship? 

  I read its a paid internship and honestly I don't care if its no pay if it will help me get where I want to be, I read it can vary from 20k-80k I just want to know if I should plan a side hustle to make more money I've never made more than 28k a year so that's all I have to plan for bills wise for the year or so.

  Finally, Is this actually helpful? Would this apprenticeship significantly increase my chances of getting an entry level software engeneir job?  And could I expect to land a job at IBM with this apprenticeship especially considering I would learn on my own time too? I've just struggled with breaking that barrier from learning and building things to actually landing a job.

  Thank You for reading and giving any information that would help me and if there's anything else someone might want to add to this experience please let me know!"

m84h20,5,2021-03-18,Higher Diploma in Data Analytics?,mannix67,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/m84h20/higher_diploma_in_data_analytics/,"Hi guys, so I am a recent graduate with BBs (Hons) level 8 in Marketing. Since graduating and obtaining an internship, I have realised that I don't have much interest in marketing and can't see myself doing it in the long run. However, within the role I have now, it involves a lot of analysis, creating new dashboards, carrying out A/b testing, analysing data on email and social media campaigns, etc. and i actually enjoy this aspect of the job.  It has made me realize that perhaps becoming a data analyst is something that would interest me.

Considering I don't come from a programming or maths background, I am considering doing a H/dip in data analytics at a reputable university in September.

For those who don't know what a H/Dip is, ""A Higher Diploma takes a year to complete. Generally speaking, you need an Honours Bachelor Degrees to do a Higher Diploma. Students typically do the Higher Diploma when they switch to a different field of study from their Honours Bachelor Degree. "" The course will be paid for by the Irish government under a grant scheme to increase the supply of workforce in high demand jobs and will also have three months work experience as part of the course. This sounds like a great way to get into the field of data analytics.

Here is a brief description of the course content -

**Industrial Data Analytics Project- 15 months long-  (15 credits)**  \- Applied Data Analytics and Visualisation project, in collaboration with industry and placement partner.

**introduction to Programming in Python-(5 credits)** Introduction to Programming in Python (Algorithms and Information Processing, Control Structures, Modular Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, File Input/Output, Data Structures, Graphics and Graphical User Interfaces)

***Databases (5 credits)***\- This module will provide the student with the information and technical know-how to establish, manage and optimally use databases.

***Internet Programming***\- (**5 credits**)

**Human Computer Interaction** **(5 credits)**

**Statistics for Data Science 1 (5 credits)** \- The course provides an introduction to probabilistic and statistical methods needed to make reasonable and useful conclusions from data. Topics include probabilistic reasoning, data generation mechanisms, modern techniques for data visualisation, inferential reasoning and prediction using real data and the principles of reproducible research. The course will rely heavily on R

**Business intelligence (5 credits) -** Database and Data Warehouse Technologies and Architectures, Data Integration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts and tools, Data Modelling, NoSQL, OLAP, KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), Dashboarding, Querying and Reporting, Vendor Tools

**Applied Data Science with R (5 credits) -** Using the R programming language and tidyverse libraries for exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, data modelling and data transformation.

**Statistics for Data Science 2 (5 credits)** This course will provide an introduction to commonly used techniques in statistics when analysing data from experiments and observational studies. Topics include classical and modern methods in interval estimation, regression models for prediction problems, modern approaches for visualising multivariate data and the principles of reproducible research.

**Data Visualisation(5 credits)**\-Data Visualisation is concerned with techniques and technologies for the visual representation of data and the results and evaluation of data analytic processes. This module takes a practical approach to introducing learners to the strengths and weaknesses of human perception, and the use of best practices to represent complex and large data stories using visual primitives. The module demonstrates the role of visualisation in exploratory data analysis and its fundamental role in explaining data analytics outcomes. The practical work in this module is done using the R programming language.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because there is a lot of R and python within the course, I am currently in the process of getting proficient at both those languages , aswell as plans to become fluent in SQL and highly proficient in tableau from here until September.

*questions to you-*

**What should I learn in my own spare time that the course doesn't cover or that I haven't thought of?**

**Do you think I will be employable once i complete this course or will i have to do more?**

**Does this course sound like a waste of time? (because it sounds very good to me)**

interested to hear your opinions, thanks for your time."

m84ljw,2,2021-03-18,What’s the smartest move to make now to equip myself for career and financial success in this field?,Icy-Guard5230,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m84ljw/whats_the_smartest_move_to_make_now_to_equip/,"So, I’m turning 26 and am in my Master’s program for Computer Science. I got my Bachelor’s in an unrelated field (business) and didn’t love the work or the pay. But this program is reputable and required 6 ramp up courses before getting into foundational CompSci coursework. So far, I enjoy the work. It’s brutal. And a really steep learning curve. But I feel like if I could figure things out it’d be a rewarding career path for me. Concepts come very natural to me, but hard code on a blank slate has been difficult. My grades are good but I’m not confident. But I’ve only been doing this school workfor maybe a year. 

My past experience isn’t really relevant to compsci jobs. And I’m not yet sure if I want to make my concentration in DS or SE. I feel more aptitude with DS (I previously worked with sports data), but SE feels like it’s be more rewarding. Regardless, not sure. And I’d like to build confidence up. I’ve talked to my career guidance department about mentor ships, jobs, on campus opportunity and there isn’t much. Which is why I’m here. 

I have 3 years or so of experience in tech strategy, rollout, communication, etc. And I just wanted to see if anyone had input on how to gain more experience. I’ve thought of remote part time internships (I do still need FT work to pay the bills, but I’m obviously unqualified for CS jobs rn). And I’m not exactly sure what direction I want to go. But I’m wondering if anyone may have ideas on what to look at to best equip myself for when I eventually do graduate (5/23) so that maybe I have some work experience or build up confidence in an actual work setting. I just want to have a versatile amount of options so I can capitalize on my Masters to do rewarding work and set myself up for employment. I know this is vague and I’d love to chat about it if it helps. But really any way to do 10-15 hours for some money to gain experience or just anything I may be unable to think of coming from outside the field would be great. Only real restriction is I have to be remote at the moment. Otherwise I’m very open to any input or advice"

I am not entirely sure if this post is allowed, but I was wondering if I could have some help making a very important decision.  As a senior in high school, I am trying to decide which college I should attend next year.  My major is going to be aero/astronautical engineering, focusing on astronautical engineering.  For reference, I hope to eventually design spacecraft, satellites, (maybe even moon/mars bases?) etc.  I do plan on earning at least a masters, and maybe a doctoral degree.  The following are the schools I have been accepted to:

Purdue University

Embry Riddle (Daytona Beach)

University of Colorado Boulder

Arizona State University

University of California Davis

University of California Irvine

University of California Los Angeles

I am very fortunate to have been accepted to all of the schools I applied to, but this also makes my choice very difficult.  Therefore, I figured I would ask for the opinions of other people.  I am looking for a program that is well established, with a substantial amount of opportunities for internships, job fairs, etc.  Additionally, I value a reputable name will carry value when I am seeking a job.  While the cost of each school is not a major concern for me, it is still a factor that I am considering.

I have watched and researched a fair bit on each school, and there are two schools that I believe are the strongest candidates.  However, I have found it quite difficult to differentiate between which schools have a strong aeronautical program and which ones have a strong astronautical program.

If you have any opinion or thoughts on this matter, or even know of somewhere or someone who can help me, please feel free to share.  This has turned out to be quite an overwhelming process, so any information is welcome.  Thank you in advance!"

For reference, it’s unpaid and counts for credit, but you also have to pay tuition in order to enroll in the program so it’s a lil pricey. I’ve been trying to find an internship for the summer but it’s been kind of difficult lately."
m86ops,9,2021-03-18,Retaking COP3223C waiver?,camaro_guy99,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/m86ops/retaking_cop3223c_waiver/,So in Spring 2019 I got a D in intro to C but my advisor reassured me that it was acceptable and I wouldn't have to retake the class. I met with her every semester including last week and she said that I was on track to graduate. Today I just got an email from a different advisor saying that a class I'm taking in the fall requires atleast a C in COP3223 and that this wasn't new to the class. So it's been 2 years since I took the class and never heard a word about having to retake it and they tell me 2 semesters before I graduate. Is there a way to request a waiver to not have to take it and override into the class? I just feel it's unfair to tell me 2 years after and mu advisor even told me I'm good knowing the classes I have to take and knowing I had a D. I was told today I have to retake it this summer in order to graduate on-time and I plan on having an internship onto of a single class already. Not sure I'd be able to do 3 classes.
m87ohn,6,2021-03-18,Looking to Switch out of CS Junior Year of College,AltruisticHorror7769,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/m87ohn/looking_to_switch_out_of_cs_junior_year_of_college/,"I'm a CS major at US university, and I enjoy CS, but I'm questioning whether I want to major in it. 

I started programming when I was 11 and I just loved it. I've been programming all the time ever since with plenty of personal projects, and I've had a couple internships, but I've not enjoyed them as much as I thought I would. CS has always been such a part of me that I really couldn't imagine doing something else. I've been thinking a lot about it recently, and honestly, I really just like logic, solving problems, and learning interesting things. CS always used to fulfill that, but I feel like I've spent so much time on it that I'm not learning all of the other interesting things out there. As a result, I'm just uninterested in all my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I like programming, and CS will always be a part of my life, but I feel like I should be making better use of all the money I'm spending at College learning something new. Also, the idea of working a 9-5 desk job looking at a screen just sounds exhausting, whether it's in CS or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some majors I've considered:

Physics - I loved it in High School and I've spent a huge amount of time teaching myself physics. I've always been interested in space and astronomy. It's interesting, but it's pretty difficult. More importantly, I'm not sure what I'll do with it practically

Biology - I loved learning cell biology and the biology of the human body. I really hate the ecology parts of bio, but I really want to learn about how the body and other organisms work. I feel like there's so much unresearched stuff out there in biology that's just waiting to be discovered and applied. It's incredible how complex the brain is, and there are so many things we can learn about it. Practically speaking though, I've heard biology is just a lot of memorization, which I'm terrible at and really hate. 

Math - I've taught myself a lot of math, but there's so much more out there. I've also taken a huge interest in Fractals and spent hundreds of hours learning about them. I know I really like math, but what are the practical jobs in the space? Also, this would be an extremely tough major. 

Economics/Finance/Business/PolySci too

&amp;#x200B;

I like working with people, but I also like working with logic. I did debate in high school which was all about taking complex, logical topics that really matter and conveying them to people. I loved it and I was good at it. Are there any jobs that combine people and logic well?

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing is that I'm a CS major with a lot of experience going into my Junior year of college. Do I really want to throw all of that away to learn something new?"

I want to pursue something automotive or motorsports and got into a couple of schools for Engineering. I also have had a bit of a history of struggling and succeeding in school. My avg GPA in HS is around 3.2 and I also scored a 29 ACT (32 in practice). Pre-covid, I was doing so great I could just listen to lectures in my classes and ace tests, but in covid, I really struggle to adapt and get in a work mindset which shows I may not be super adaptable. I went from summer school pre-algebra in 8th grade to my third JC calc class this semester so I am a bit ahead (took college phys as well). On the downside, I still have gaps in my knowledge and realize I sometimes bite off more than I can chew. I'd also say I am smarter than my grades reflect and if something relates to my career or interests, I become more motivated and learn info rapidly. I'm looking to choose a college that I can succeed in with good effort and still be able to do things related to my careers such as internships or FSAE (and to maintain my sanity).

Just based on academics, career-related opportunities, support, and manageability, which of these colleges do you think would be best or would recommend? Below are my top schools I've been accepted to, all for either mechanical or first-year engineering programs. I will consider other factors with my parents but above all, I just want to do everything I can to stay committed to this major to succeed in my career path.

I received many queries around college life, interview tips, internships, and college fees. So, I reached out to one of the current students pursuing an LLB at IIT Kharagpur for an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbJYE7ecwcs).

Ms. Pallavi Bhatia is a second-year law student specializing in Intellectual Property Law at the institute.

In the interview, she answers various questions that are often posed to aspirants preparing for the exam, like the pattern, syllabus of the test, and the interview process. We also understand the role of internships and where they fit in the 3-year timeline of the course.  

She also shares with us about her college life and the co-curricular activities at the place.

Do let me know if you would like more such interviews and which colleges you want to hear about? Also, if you want to give an interview regarding a lesser talked course or college, let me know. If you find this all useful do think about liking the video and subbing the channel, it will further motivate me to bring such content!

PS: Last date to apply for the LLB/LLM courses for the upcoming session is 20th March.

I got this internship offer from this crypto fund of funds based in London (quantitative investment side intern) and I just figured that I'll roll with it as well it helped pay the bills and would be a good learning experience while I look for work in sg. 

Around 9 months later - I've automated all the data collection and management work for all our funds using python. Set up multiple scripts to do bunch of fund and market monitoring tasks while also setting up scripts to generate dynamic quant templates (bunch of financial metrics) pertaining to our fund needs. Eventually got offered a starting role as an investment analyst! 

I was the only intern who could code and while I didn't have a full fledged finance background per se (all the other interns were finance majors), my python skills (albeit quite basic lol) helped me separate myself and add some unique value to the firm (it's a startup so a smaller team and no one else in the company can work with python/R) 


I just wanted to thank this subreddit tbh. I don't post often but I lurk around alot. I know it's just the start and for everyone who's just starting to get into python - stick with it. It might take a while but once you actually do an actual project that's useful for your needs - you'll finally start feeling that your hard work is worth it!"

I consider myself a professional person and extroverted but I feel like I came off as one of those cocky arrogant people that doesn't actually know what they are talking about. It felt really forced and I literally didn't have to code a single thing so that's even more hurtful. I see myself as a good communicator but this is proving to me that I am probably not.  I know this experience will help in the future but I feel so stupid and out of place. I feel like I have done nothing in relation to every other student and always wonder if I am even right for CS. I love technology and programming is fun but every time I have to deal with something formal I struggle heavily. I get A's in all my CS courses and really apply myself but the way I fully came off as unexperienced and not knowledgeable is making me upset.

I know this is just one interview and it won't kill me and it's a learning experience but I just needed to rant. I also am a junior and have this thing where I feel like I have to get an internship this summer but am too unqualified to apply.  I am also first generation in college and America so I have an insane pressure to be good at everything even though it is okay and valid to fail.

I unfortunately had to leave that job when I was most coming into my own due to personal reasons unrelated to the job or my superiors.

Since then I have been living on the pacific coast of Mexico in a small port town  trying to plant and manage my own small Jackfruit orchards.  I now no longer wish to remain in agriculture as it has become less profitable and much less mentally fulfilling.

Therefore, I am learning coding since October with the hopes of ether landing a remote job.  Plus I ABSOLUTELY LOVE CODING and feel that it was definitely what I should have studied when I was in college had I known, as it totally fits my mental profile and fulfills me.

After I learn more, What is the likelihood that I could land a remote internship with an American company/individual while in my situation? Being that I live in Mexico. I could travel to the USA as needed but my home needs to remain where I am now due to my family situation.

I kind of hope/feel that the biggest hurdle after learning a certain amount on my own is just getting in the door but I could be wrong. When I worked for that American company I was actually working from Guadalajara, Mexico. Yes it was in an office with coworkers in close proximity, But as well I was in constant contact with several other coworkers spread across many cities in the USA as well as other countries and we all relied on each other. In fact, when I was on the Account team handling the planet's largest social network, I was the only one on the team located in Mexico and the rest of the team were all individuals located in different cities across the USA.

However, The main reason I want an internship is to learn as well as serve. Can One learn and serve well as a remote intern? Or are my hopes maybe too high?

Thanks"

I have a 3.89 and I'm in the honor society for both my majors (undergraduate Mathematics and MS in CS). I don't go to an ivy league school, or even a ""target"" school for CS, but I have experience in open source software, worked at a fairly well known private company this summer, and have great references from my bosses there and my advisor.   

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot, however, seem to land an internship. I rarely get interviews, but when I do, I'm told they aren't interested after like 3 rounds of intense two-hour grillings. I understand that internships are really competitive, and I'm not entitled to one or anything, but I really need a job so that I can pay down my college debt and afford my bills this summer without having to mooch off my parents. At this point, I'm probably going to have to take a job waiting tables like I had before, and I feel like that would look awful on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else ever been here? I've applied on LinkedIn, Monster, my school's Careers website, Indeed, RippleMatch, and internal ATS applications. I've had my resume reviewed over 10 times by my peers, random people on the internet, and the career center. I've networked at the Career Fair only to be told that all the intern spots are booked up for this summer. I'm kind of at my wit's end with this industry in that I love the work, and would love to do it for the rest of my life, but I've found the application process demoralizing, frustrating, and seemingly impossible. I really need a job to pay the bills, but I might just stay in academia for the rest of my life if the barrier to well-paying job is this hard to cross.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm willing to take anybody's advice at this point. Here's my resume just in case you're interested [https://i.imgur.com/Tp4wFPB.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tp4wFPB.png)."

I’m a senior CE student looking to break into Product Management either after college or eventually down the line. I’ve been actively applying to summer internships but given that I’m an international student from a pretty shitty country and due to the pandemic I haven’t been able to find any PM internship.

Now to my question. I recently got two offers from a small but growing startup in Europe and from a recently founded (2018) but with a very decent portfolio VC firm in the Middle East.

The European startup offered a position as Management intern with this job description: 

* Identifying internal and external (strategic) issues that could affect growth 
* Perform (financial) analysis of acquisition candidates 
* Be part of OKR meetings and track OKRs for management team 
* Market analysis 
* Competitor analysis 
* Plan and coordinate business reviews, resource allocations, organization structures, and financial analysis
* Manage your own projects

The VC firm offered a 2 months internship with a 1 month training (introduction to VC and workshops/talks with startup founders) program and 1 month as a VC analyst.

What opportunity would better prepare me for PM in terms of skills and bolstering my resume to land first round interviews?

Thanks!"

This is a researcher I had cold emailed, and I don't really plan to do other research internships in the future, so I don't really know how I can ""stay in touch"" with this person (I of course know that they meant to keep in touch professionally-speaking). What do people usually mean by this ?"
m8rq8i,11,2021-03-19,Requested Work Prior to Internship,alby37145,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m8rq8i/requested_work_prior_to_internship/,"I managed to secure an ML internship at an experimental R&amp;D branch of a large tech company this upcoming summer. Over the interview process, I learnt that they were working on quite an ambitious project but the team seemed very capable and friendly.

After signing my contract in January, they have reached out to ask if we could schedule a couple of meetings prior to the internship, to get on the same page about what I will be working on over summer. I thought this was a good idea initially, so I agreed and we had a couple of productive Zoom meetings. Speeding forward to March, they are asking me to do quite hands on exploratory data analysis and start looking at legacy codes. 

I just wanted to get your opinions as to whether this type of work prior to the start of the internship is generally common and if I could just say no? I don’t want to sound unenthusiastic to the team before I’ve even started but I feel like I am asked to do an unpaid pre-internship before summer. To line managers here, would you be offended if an intern said no this request?

[EDIT]

To clarify, I’m genuinely not too bothered about doing out-of-contract hours. It is just that I currently have other commitments before the internship and I don’t want to produce second-class work just for the sake of not upsetting them. I guess another hidden question in there is whether or not you see a potential red flag in their request? They made it sound very matter-of-fact that this is what interns should do before they join their team."

This year has been so difficult. I don't even know what good is this post gonna bring to me. I am a graduate student and have been looking for a Summer 2021 SDE/ML/DS internship since October 2020. People all around me have been getting internships. I have applied to 250+ companies. I have solved 500+ Leetcode problems. Even my CodeSignal score is 847/850. I love competitive programming and even did it in my undergrad. I have done multiple internships in past and have good knowledge of Web Development and Machine Learning. And yet, all I receive are rejects and rejects. ""You are not a good fit."", ""We chose someone else."", ""Positions have been filled"", ""Please, keep checking our careers page."", ""We will store your information for future openings"", ..., etc.This ride has been a great sucker punch for me. I don't know what more I need to do.I have been trying to keep myself positive and hoping that something good is going to come my way. But, alas, the truth is nothing will. I will keep applying to positions but the possibility of landing an internship seems bleak now.People say that something good eventually comes out, nothing is wasted, Failures teach you stuff, something better is planned, etc. But, that really doesn't seem to be the case. All the hours put into Leetcode and programming really seems to be wasted. I am skeptical and don't believe in luck or God, but, truth is the entire process is highly stochastic and sometimes if the odds are stacked against your favour, then all the time put into acquiring skills and applying to jobs are all really just a big waste of time."

1. **Art teacher:** Have known him since freshman year, the only freshman in his third year art class. We’re pretty close and I love him a lot but he’s pretty busy so idk how his letters turned out.

2. **Chem H teacher:** I LOVE HIM. His classroom is basically my safe space at school. He’s been there for me through super tough times and I give him food in return. I don’t get how people can rate their letters I have no idea what they looked like.

3. **Counselor:** Our school is huge so counselors usually pretty much barely remember students. I think I’ve bothered mine so much that she remembered my name but that’s the extent of our relationship lmao

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

1. **Columbia:** Terrible, the interviewer was barely paying attention, it lasted for 20 minutes because I told them I was getting over a cold and they said they didn’t want to make me suffer so they cut it pretty short (probably of them just trying to end it early lmao)

2. **Georgetown:** It was pretty good! It felt more like a conversation than anything and I wasn’t a nervous reck like before. Too bad I decided I hated the school the moment I submitted their apps though I really liked my interviewer

3. **Cornell:** AMAZING. Called for an hour and a half. Made the interviewer laugh so hard she snorted. We made a lot of jokes and I learned a lot and it made me fall in love with Cornell tbh. It was kind of sad it doesn’t really count towards your app. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

* **CommonApp:** Wrote about my knitting and how it taught me the importance of details and patience (I swear it’s a little more interesting than this) I haven’t read it since October but I think it was okay at best compared to a lot of others so I’m a little nervous

* **UCs**: Wrote about knitting, art, my speech impediment, and how art history had led to my interest in international politics. I was really proud of a couple of them.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

* **Acceptances:**

*UC Santa Barbara*

m8xk7b,0,2021-03-19,Best US cities for software developer internships?,Vyper4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m8xk7b/best_us_cities_for_software_developer_internships/,"I'm having trouble getting a software developer internship for the summer and may have to wait until next summer. I'm going to continue building up my portfolio, but I think another thing holding me back has been limiting myself to jobs in my state. I only recently started looking into internships outside of my state, but I'm wondering what the best major US cities are to get internships.

By best, I mean easiest cities to get a developer internship in or ones with the highest amount of openings. Another criteria would be the ease of living there (cost of living mainly) so that you can focus on the internship and less on whether you can actually manage to survive in a new city for a few months. 

I also feel cost of living isn't as important as a few years ago considering there are more remote opportunities now, although that does probably mean more competition.

So what cities do you suggest?"

Currently in the interview process for a company. They didn’t list out the requirements for what they wanted in a data science college intern since their DS team is still fairly small. 

Did my first round with them and killed my behavioral questions. I also think i impressed my interviewer with my experience in ML/DS doing work for a middle-of-the-pack Fortune 500 company through a research project at MIT. Work involves PCA, Kmeans clustering and k-nearest neighbors to create a predictive price model. 

However, the part in my interview where I screwed up was when my interviewer asked me SQL questions. I was unable to answer them because I’ve literally never learned it in school nor had the experience using it during my research project. For context, I am an economics major and statistics minor at a liberal arts college. 

I was wondering if my chances are over? I have experience in a couple different coding languages (python, Java) as well as stats programs (R, Stata) but SQL is the only area I’m lacking. I’ve been told it’s fairly easy to pick up but I’m nervous that because it’s so easy, it was an expectation to know."

So this summer, I have been successful in securing an internship at a major investment bank. So far, I have no experience of working on real projects within the industry of software engineering. I would say that I do have strong programming fundamentals that have allowed be to secure top positions in my classes at university but those have mostly been solo projects( I am in yr 2 out of 3 in Uni). My question is this: I have been told that I will need ‘zero to very little’ experience to get started but considering the fact that it’s a very competitive environment, I don’t want to be poorly prepared. Thus I ask: could you guys provide some pointers towards what sort of software development tech/tools/libraries/etc should I look into that would allow me to be best prepared of this internship.

As far as I am aware: they mainly program in Java, some cloud-based work is also done and it’s an investment bank so you folks might have a better idea of what sort of tech they use."

m93j1b,2,2021-03-20,can't hold onto jobs - Need insight on what is wrong with me,Equivalent-South-160,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/m93j1b/cant_hold_onto_jobs_need_insight_on_what_is_wrong/,"I can't seem to be able to hold on to jobs at all. I am getting really scared on how I will support myself and family. 

I have never been fired for fault or being inappropriate and have never had any bad comments on my work performance. I have had a couple internships that went well, got good feedback, but then when I apply for a fulltime position nothing, or they even encourage me to apply and then ghost me. I have had one part-time job/internship where my first manager wanted me to falsify data and I refused, so they changed me managers. I produced a report that people (outside the group) said was the best thing produced by our group in the last 10 years, but shortly after they told me that I could stay for another couple weeks for me to find something else, but that they didn't have any work for me( despite people complaining to be overloaded with work at each staff meeting...but they were on their phone all the times so they weren't really). I also pissed off some people by doing as much work as they were by only working 20 hours a week (but again they spent 20 hours a week on Facebook, and 2 hours lunch breaks...so it wasn't that hard). I understand this may not have been a good fit, but a close  friend of mine is in a very similar position and they just called him a genius who can get ""so much done"". How come I become the person who makes them look bad instead?

Then I got another part-time job, and it was fun and going well, but they said they didn't have more contracts coming in, and I told them that I was definitely interested when they did, but instead 9 months later they hired a young kid straight out of college instead when the next contracts came in. I taught a class that had some of the best attendance, and outcomes but they never invited me back. 

I just picked up an entry level personal service job, and my first client let me go after 3 meetings because they decided to go with a facility instead, which is fine, but they don't even know when that will be starting for sure, so it almost seemed like the perfect excuse to let me go. 

Interestingly enough, the two jobs I have been able to keep have been online (even pre-COVID) and I only ever communicated through phone or emails with the team. Also I have very little issues in diverse organizations where I have volunteered my time, the issues really seem to be when I need to get paid. I know the threshold is lower if you don't get paid, people are willing to put up with more, but I thought it was an interesting data point. 

I just can't figure out what I am doing wrong. If there is any common theme, it's that I tend to get scapegoated for whatever issue is going on in the office at the time. For example, let's say I am working a 9-5pm and need to approve something in the chain of A to B to C and I am person B. A is 2 days late on schedule and sends me the file at 2am, I approve it at 4:30am (somehow!) and send it to C who takes 3 days to process it. We are now late by 4 days, somehow my inability to process things timely will be the culprit, not the delay of A or C, and if I try to defend myself I am just told to stop blaming others, or stop being so negative. If I take it, then they tell me this is not a good fit for me and maybe I should be looking into some other line of work. 

If you ask me what type of role I end up at in a group, it would be ""doing whatever is needed"", which translates to making others look good, or the group bitch. lol but seriously when I join a team, the team looks much better, but they never seem to appreciate it. I am like lubricant in a motor. 

Sorry for the long rant, I really need help, I have a 2 year old, and if anything happen to my partner I am afraid we might end of on the streets. 

Thank you!"

I'm finishing up my master's degree in mechatronics at the moment, and am interested in getting into software engineering. I have a lot of programming experience from my master's through various projects and stuff - for my thesis I'm creating an AR app for an industrial application, before that I did a part time internship doing basic web development, and after my thesis I'll have a 3 month internship in VR development. Despite this, I feel like I'm missing a lot of formal knowledge that one would get through a computer science degree. My knowledge of databases, design patterns is rather limited and I've taken a couple online DSA courses that I guess amounts to maybe half of an actual DSA course in uni. 

My question is, how much is a junior developer expected to know at first? I have no intention of working for FAANG, at least at first, but I'm wondering if I should just focus on grinding leetcode, and hope that they would be willing to help me fill in the gaps in a first job, or I should  focus on learning other things before applying to jobs. What do you guys think?"

Extracurriculars:
Was in math team for 4 years, didn’t really do anything exceptional in it because the school is insanely competitive, as it has 4000ish students

Club YES Volunteer:
Was in it for 2 years so far, basically volunteered at a lot of places, and got around 80 hours through here, but want to get like 120 hours through here before Apps

My school’s UNICEF chapter Treasurer/Exec Board:
Biggest student organization at my high school, numbering 200+ students.

Helped organize a number of events with them, which didn’t take off as much because it’s hard to fundraise with COVID

Raised $1300 for Yemen Crisis through in person fundraising, unfortunately we couldn’t do in person stuff since then because COVID became so massive, but projected to fundraise a total of 3000 by college apps


Codeucate Teaching Intern:
Codeucate is a company based on Chicago, that has influences in the Midwest region and Texas, NY, Seattle’s, etc. it is a non profit that teaches kids how to code at a super low price. I believe we have 100ish students rn

The name of the role is a bit misleading. Most people are volunteers, so an Intern is like a Volunteer leader, of which there are 300ish volunteers, and then so I, along with the 4 other Teaching Interns, help plan the infrastructure of the teaching side of the company and help direct its processes and have changed it in a few ways as well

Business Professionals of America:
1 year. Kind of like a club that serves to “get students ready for the workplace’”, but is really just a competition at the regional, state, and national levels in multiple finance, marketing, and Tech related events. I have done tech events, and the details will be found in awards section 

Science Olympiad varsity teammate
1 year. Our school has been the continuous state champions for 3+ years, and it’s the most competitive science Olympiad team in MN. I got a varsity spot, which had really high competition. We probably will win state this year and go to nationals again, more details in awards.

150 participants, and 13 varsity spots 

Will try for captain next year, but will definitely become an event leader at the very least in Terms of leadership positions 

Matnasium Math tutor:
1 years. Basically tutors kids and get dough

(Probable in the future) Will found Computer Science club at my school:
Havent done it yet because the teachers are so unresponsive, but will found it next year or maybe this year, and we are projected to have 40+ members

(Probable in the future) will join school robotics team next year: haven’t dont it yet because I never realized that the apps closed for this year as early as it did, and was pretty stupid my freshman and sophomore years


Awards: (not a lot :( )
———————-
Science Olympiad: out of 4 competitions so far (40+ teams, 80+ teams, 130+ teams), got gold in 1 event in 40+ teams competition, 4th in another 1 (2 medals), 2nd place in 80+ teams one for 1 event 

Probably will medal for all events in state, and maybe 1 gold medal

Presidential volunteer award: bronze (did it this year)

BPA: 
3rd in Java programming in state (40ish state level competitors and 150+ competitors in MN total counting regional levels)

1st in SQL Fundamentals(30ish in state, and around 70 total competitors including regional levels)

Bunch of other open placements (3rd, 5th, 5th), whatever 

Hoping for USACO gold by application season

LOR
————-
Honestly, will probably ask my AP Lang teacher(got an author and main character from one of our books to come to our class and have a sort of QA section, it was super fun! And I think it got me in her good sight!) (9/10)

Was gonna ask My AP Bio teacher because she called me one of her top 3 students from our year, but then she implicitly called me immature and undependable this year :’(. (Might still ask her, but probably will ask other AP Bio teacher who saw me going blind, but still working super hard in the class (7/10)

APUSH teacher: has sent us a letter saying that I’m one of her favorite students and most hardworking  and successful students

I understand things take time but the fact that I cant even elevate users to install print drivers / have to reach out for even my level 1 tickets is frustrating because I feel like I’m a drag to the team. The other analyst on the team got admin rights fairly quickly (granted he has a year at the place over me) but I think it’s because he’s was the only analyst at the time . Even he’s frustrated by this because his plate is loaded. How do they expect me to be the analyst doing level 1 tickets but can’t provide me the tools to do them effectively? We’re also pretty understaffed

I’ve spoke to my manager and he said I’d be getting more work but I just dont know if it means more level one tickets since my colleague is assuming higher responsibilities . 


Ultimately my next goal is to go to security or assume some sort of sys admin role

Am I just overreacting or should I seriously consider leaving?"

we have a rescue (been with us for almost a year) and she's submissive by nature; she's the most gentle soul, no triggers, not reactive, has zero aggression, rarely barks, independent (she's perfectly fine on her own and will come around for pets when she wants it but when she's done with that, she'll just leave). The thing is, sometimes she sits there and ""looks"" so sad; sometimes her head is lowered and ears down. There are times when we call her she'll approach us slowly with her tail slightly lowered. We always praise her (she really is the goodest dog) and I'm wondering if that's just how submissive dogs are? Is there anything we can do to show her that she's so loved? also: she's walked 3x/day min 30mins each time; fed 2x/day, vet says she's in perfect health/weight etc and we play with her outside. Lots of love when she wants it and we let her come to us when she wants pets...although sometimes we can't help it bc she's just so darn loveable but we make a point not to be in her face all the time. She has no problems laying/sleeping on her back (belly up) so I know she feels safe here.|Sounds like you're doing everything right. It's hard not to, but you shouldn't anthropomorphize animals. A dog that looks sad may just be relaxed. I'd recommend reading up on dog behaviors and body language since you may get better about her behaviors if you know what they all mean :)
(Quick backstory: we had an 18 lb Maine coon cat who developed cancer, dropped to 9 lbs, stopped eating, and we put him to sleep. We only did palliative care. I still feel guilty that we should have given him more time ) Do you ever judge pet parents for their decision to put a pet down? How do you, as a vet, know when a pet parent should put their pet down? I know it’s left up to the parent, but what factors are most important?|The only time I've judged pet parents about euthanasia timing is when they've waited FAR too long and the animal has been clearly suffering. I'm talking owners that are either in denial or embarrassed to bring their pet in because they've never been to a vet, but by the time they come to me it can't walk, hasn't been eating for weeks, covered in it's own excrement and possibly even worse.
 |Other than that I tell owners with sick/terminal or old pets that you obviously know then best and when you feel it's time it are thinking it might be time, then it is time. I never judge if owners don't want to do everything, as long as whatever they choose does not cause the animal to suffer needlessly.
 |For owners that are struggling to decide if it's time I have then make a list of what makes their pet happiest, at least 3 favorite things. If they are no longer able to or want to do two of those three then it's time. That or mark a calendar of good and bad days, if the bad start to become more often than the good it is time.
I have a 6-year old polydactyl rescue cat. His front right paw has a whopping 7 toes, with one completely non-functional “toe”/claw. It just sort of hangs off the side of his paw, and doesn’t support any weight. That nail is very deformed, with a large quick. It grows very quickly and if we don’t clip it regularly enough, it will grow into the pad of that toe (which is also very deformed and calloused- almost as hard as the nail itself). We manage to clip the rest of his nails without much problem, but this one he won’t let us touch. We usually end up holding him down to do it, which is traumatic for all of us. It can also catch on things easily and rip away completely. My question is: even though we would NEVER declaw our cat, does it make sense to have this single claw removed? Or would that be even worse than the current situation? Thank you!|As the other vet already commented, if it's that hard to manage and painful/traumatic to your cat to clip then I would absolutely consider amputation and think it is worth the discussion with your vet. I would also recommend x-rays prior of both the foot and the lungs to check for other issues and to help with surgical planning.
Where do you personally draw the line on life-saving measures vs. palliative care? I've been ""lucky"" so far that euthanasia has been the obvious choice for all of my dogs so far, but I am facing the choice of possible spinal surgery for my 8 y/o dog as a treatment for lameness (which has been mild so far). My gut is telling me that something as invasive as spinal surgery would be extremely traumatic for an animal who doesn't know what is happening or why. I sort of think pain management and physical therapy is the better choice, though it will probably shorten his life. Then I feel like an asshole. I know vets don't like to advise their patients' caretakers on such personal decisions, but what would you say to an anonymous stranger?|Honestly there is so much that goes into that kind of decision. As much as we don't like to admit it personal finances and ability for proper after care are definitely something to consider. In the case of spinal surgery you also may still need long term physical therapy and pain management. It also depends on the rest of your dogs health and stress at the hospital. 8yo is still pretty going for most breeds, but for others it's near the end of their life.
 |All of that being said, I put off doing an aggressive surgery for my cat for chronic eat infections (total eat canal ablation, or TECA) because I was worried about his age and the healing process, but I finally but the bullet when he was 10yo and he was literally an entirely different cat after one we removed a source of chronic pain and inflammation. I felt so guilty for not doing it sooner and didn't really realize how much pain he was in until after the surgery.
What are the best ""inside jokes"" that small animal veterinarians tell each other?|Oh man there are so many... Most are pretty morbid or immature to be honest. Plenty of poop/rectal jokes. We laugh a lot about clients that insist on feeding their dogs the best food and homecooking diets and such, but then they go outside and eat shit..
 |We also dig a lot on human doctors and nurses (mostly in good fun). I think there are a lot of medical jokes that overlap between human and animal medicine. Some abbreviations like for euthanasia, TTJ= transfer to jesus
 |For more fun stuff, lately everything has been curbside where animals come in to the hospital but clients stay in their cars and then we go over the exam findings by phone. Since we don't have to worry about what we say in front of clients we're usually just all gushing over how stupidly adorable the really fat cat is and using a ""chonk"" scale to describe them. That or just all taking turns cuddling the puppy and smothering then with cuddles while some owners are insisting from outside that their pet is really anxious without them...
[deleted]|She probably will never enjoy the company or play with the puppy, but could learn to coexist with one. Usually my biggest advice for introducing any new pet to a cat is to be sure that cat has a safe space where only they are allowed to escape the chaos of the rest of the house and from other animals. This is also a good place to have an extra litter box and water so if the cat is too nervous to leave they have access to what they need and won't have accidents in the house. Never force interaction, allow them to warm up with time and draw their own conclusions. Also honestly if the cat swats at the puppy, let it happen, it's a good learning experience for the puppy as long as the nails are but long enough to do serious damage.
I have a beautiful rescue cat (who was a foster fail) but unfortunately I don’t know his age. When we began fostering him, the rescue couldn’t tell much about him other than his medical needs and such; nothing on an age however. I’ve done some research online to see if I could determine his age but I really have no clue. If I took him to a vet would they be able to do an assessment and give me an age estimate? I know it’s a silly thing to want to know his age but I would just love to know as much about him and hope to give him a healthy long life. Thanks!|Aging an adult cat can be very tricky. Sometimes we can tell by teeth and dental health as well as lens clarity in the eyes, but it will still be a fairly wide range since genetics and other life factors can cause poor dental health at a young age or excellent dental health at an old age. Still worth having then checked out by a vet though so they can try and identify and issues early and discuss best ways to set him up for success in the long run!
We adopted a Boston Terrier puppy this week, I believe he’s about 14 weeks old. Long story short, he had to have one of his hind legs amputated is there any recommended therapies we can do at home to help him with stability and strength in his remaining hind leg? He gets around just fine but isn’t always the most stable and struggles with stairs.|He's so young, at this point his bones and muscles will be growing and adapting for him to compensate for the missing limb. Puppies in general aren't the most adorable when they're young, so he is likely still just figuring the world out. Once he's full grown biggest things will be to keep him at a healthy weight and consider just getting him started on a joint supplement early to help protect the remaining joints as much as possible.
Hi Dr. My family has a 6lb maltese who just turned 10. The dog does not. stop. gnawing on his paws. What could be the reason for this? He gets feisty when I try to touch them, and sometimes can be docile and will lick my hand if I massage the paw a little.|Paw chewing is most commonly a sign of allergies or anxiety. If dogs chew or lick their feet enough they can cause a secondary infection or severe inflammation called pododermatitis. I've seen dogs unable to walk because their feet are so sore and infected. If the hair around his paws are stained brown from licking, or the webbing between his toes is red/shiny/painful then he should see a vet to discuss possible causes and treatment options.
Are you doing okay?|I am!! Thanks for asking! Hope you're doing well! I will say it's always good to check in with your own vet. Many of my colleagues are not doing well and suffer from severe depression and high suicide risk. We get a lot of harassment daily from pet owners and unfortunately the negative comments always tend to stick and linger more than the positive ones, so be sure to treat your vet like a human and be kind!
My long haired cat pukes up hairballs often, is there any scientifically proven hairball reducer? I do brush him and feed him wet and dry food diet. Backstory, when we adopted him as a tiny kitten, he was listed as a domestic shorthair...I feel bamboozled! But we love him, hairballs and all|Honestly I've had good success with patients and my own pets on hairball control diets. Usually science diet or royal canin help the most anecdotally. I also recommend laxatone gel. If they won't eat it on their food you can put it on their paw so they want to groom it off.
My question is this: I have always wanted to be a vet but I ended up pursuing a different career due to circumstances that are not part of our discussion now. Animals are my passion, they always have been. I am going to assume you too absolutely love animals, since you chose this career. The older I got, the more I realised that I don't have the stomach to be a vet and it was actually good that I pursued another profession. As passionate as I am about animals and as much as I adore them, I cannot stomach seeing them sick, wounded, diseased or deceased. I can't, I break down, my insides hurt, my heart feels like it will explode from grief and sadness. It's too much and it's beyond my powers to handle. How do you handle this? Is it something that is taught or is it something that you become accustomed to after a while of seeing animals in bad condition? Or do you just never get used to it but it's part of the job and you have no choice? Thank you for your response. :)|So this is a factor in all medical professions. I love animals, but I also love medicine. I went into the vet profession because it joined my love of the two, but my backup plan was to be a pediatrician or other human medical doctor. I always tell people interested in the profession that you must love science and medicine as much or more than animals. I have a general curiosity and interest in working up cases and problem solving. It's never a great feeling when a case is not going as expected or you do everything right and the animal still dies, but it is part of the job and you learn to disassociate your patients some from your own pets/animals that you love. I love my patients, but I can only love them as much as their owners do and sometimes owners can't or don't want to do everything. Then there are other times that doing everything just isn't fair to the animal if it's suffering or stressed at the hospital. Really the worst feeling is when an owner just doesn't care as much as you do. When you're faced with a very treatable disease but the owner doesn't care to treat or just wants a magic shot to solve a chronic problem (sometimes because of something they caused, like chronic joint disease from obesity).
 |There are times the job is absolutely heartbreaking but those are the times I'm working closely with owners and patients I love and it just doesn't work out at we hope or I diagnose a terminal, untreatable disease. I'm these cases though the right owners are happy to have answers and happy for honesty and guidance and still work with us to make their pet as comfortable as possible during the time it has left.
 |What keeps me up at night is when I do everything and owners still blame me for the pet's loss or for having to charge them even when the outcome wasn't what we hoped when sometimes that's just life...
Sorry. My last piggy question. If you get bit by a piggy and it draws blood do you just take care of it like any other wound. Wash well, antibiotic cream ... and watch for infection? Unfortunately this happened to me today.|Yes, just clean well with soap and water. I worry much more about cat bites which can cause serious infections.
How do you handle discrimination against small animals at your practice? Here's an example of what I mean, I was just sharing this story today so it's fresh in my mind. I have six guinea pigs who are my absolute world. They're really smart and loving little companions. I used to see a regular vet but eventually found a board certified exotics vet an hour away (the only one around here). One day I saw that one of my pigs was dragging her back legs. My regular vet would have closed by the time I got there and so I took her to the old vet. I thought I was losing her and was absolutely sobbing. A man in the waiting room tried to comfort me about my ""cat"". (I use a cat carrier for them.) When I said it was a guinea pig his whole attitude changed. He laughed at me and said ""It's just a guinea pig. People eat those."" I said ""People eat cats too and yours looks scrumptious!"" The staff overheard and said it was okay for him to say that because it was ""just a guinea pig"" but saying that about a cat was rude and if I said anything again they wouldn't see us. This is just one of many examples of people treating small pets as disposable. I've also gone to vets that just prescribed any old antibiotic and the diagnosis was far off. (Diagnosed with bumblefoot when in reality it was a bladder stone.) It's actually really sad. Even some vets don't care.|Sorry to hear you had to deal with that. I used to get similar reactions when I hospitalized my rats. Unfortunately lots of people feel that animals they paid little for aren't worth managing medically which is ridiculous. I got many pets for free and would never think they deserve less care because of that. Many of my staff currently own or have owned small mammals and so are very sympathetic toward them and their owners, though there isn't much we could do if another client made a statement like that other than brush him off.
You mention an interest in animal behavior. How far do you think veterinary knowledge has progressed in this area? As with physical ailments, pets definitely can’t tell you what’s wrong or why they’re acting a certain way. (I work with a rescue, and as you might figure there’s definitely some with behavioral issues... they often end up in rescue for a reason.)|I think we know a fair amount. There is an entire boarded specialty in animal behavior which is like the equivalent to a psychiatrist and they know about many training techniques and medical therapies to help with different behavioral diseases. We're also paying more attention to it as a profession and trying to be more aware of body language during appointments, but there it's always still a lot more to learn!
so how small are you ?|Haha I'm actually the smallest vet at my practice so the title fits both ways! Many of the other doctors ask me to perform the rectals since I have the smallest fingers and they think it would be the kindest thing for the animal. Not the kindest thing for me though...
Do you see guinea pigs? Do they need yearly check ups?|I do, and I always recommend it to help monitor dental health, weight, and overall physical health and discuss husbandry. Of course it depends on your relationship with your guinea pig though and how far you're looking to manage preventative care. Otherwise just be sure to bring them in if there are any changes at all in their daily habits. Prey animals like guinea pigs are built to hide any signs of illness so you need to be very in tune to their normal behaviors and catch any subtle changes early if you want to treat issues before they are major and very severe.
I just found out my dog has cancer and will need to be put down relatively soon. How do pets handle euthanasia? Are they scared? Is it painful? What about if their owners are not there? I really really want to be there for my puppy but I'm worried the vet will make me stay in the car because of the pandemic. Any words of advice?|I would discuss this with your vet since every vet has a different protocol with euthanasia, especially with the pandemic. This is the one scenario we allow owners into the hospital with their pets currently. I typically like to make things as low stress as possible. If your dog is anxious at the vets giving oral medication at home prior can help calm them, and then I give an injectable sedative as well prior. If you're worried about going to the hospital there are also many vets doing at-home euthanasias now, including an entire company dedicated to it called Lap of Love.
Hello, my adorable cat is 23-24 years old. She doesn't seems to have health issues, she is blind since 1 years at least, but that doesn't stop her to goes upstairs, downstairs, eating, climbing on furniture and jumps on me. Anyways since probably 2-3 years she started to develop like a ""small ball of flesh or tumor I dont know on her beautiful cheek, it not painful at all, and doesn't seems to grow, it's probably 2-3 centimeters since, well always. Anyways back in the days I call to the vets to explain the situation and they told me that they rater not take her to remove it since at that ages the anesthesia might just kill her. Was that a good advice?|If it's just a fleshy growth that isn't painful or bothering her than it is likely not removing. I don't consider age a disease and she alone is not reason to avoid anesthesia but with age comes many possible diseases and great issues so you need to be very thorough working up geriatric patients prior. You also need to be wary off longer healing time after. By the sounds of it I would leave it alone as well. She's an old lady but the oldest cat on record lived to 38yo so you never know!
Do you have any advice for people who adopted adult dogs from the shelter and want to help them be the best they can be? I keep reading about socialization windows and all sorts of puppy-centric information, and feel like I missed a critical part of my dogs lives.|You can definitely still train an adult dog even if they're past the age for key socialization, it will just take longer and require a lot more patience. If you're referring to a specific pet, what kind of dog and what issues are you noticing? A lot of time the trick is to find what your dog really likes and responds to fit positive reinforcement. Some food are food motivated, others like toys, attention, specific pets or cuddling etc. Once you know this you can grade each positive reinforcement from smash reward to high reward and use the small reward regularly for easy-to-grasp behaviors, and the high reward stuff for more stressful situations or behaviors you're struggling to enforce. There is a lot or there in desensitizing as well if they are scared or nervous of something. However if you trust this process or do it incorrectly you can make matters worse. If in doubt always reach out to a certified trainer to help!
My cat has OCD &amp; she constantly grooms herself. She has short hair but the volume of it causes her to vomit. I've been feeding her Blue Buffalo indoor hairball formula. Since the hairball additive didn't help I went back to indoor formula. Between her eating to fast &amp; grooming she still throws up. She's her normal self the rest of the time. What should else I do?|Is she always vomiting hairballs when she vomits, or is it something just food or bile? There are bowls and yours too help force pets to eat slower which can help. Diets higher in fiber are also beneficial for cats. Finally looking for other causes of pain or stress. Most cats over groom from pain, allergies, or stress and may need further testing and allergy or anxiety medications.
Omg are you me? Lol. I've also done extra study in feline medicine, dentistry and feline behaviour! Hello from Aus 😁|Awesome! We need more vets interested in behavior and kitties! I was seriously considering jumping ship and going to work in New Zealand or AUS with how covid was going in the US, but then ended up buying a house and committed to staying here
I have a male rabbit that refuses to eat hay or vegetables, and when I let him out of his pen to play, always tries to eat dog food kibbles if he can get anywhere near the dog's food. His teeth have become overgrown and I have taken him to the vet to have them filed down more than once. Should his teeth be removed? I give him fruit juice to drink because I am worried about his nutrition. He also has dandruff. I have other rabbits that are litter-trained, fixed, and free-roaming in another part of the house who don't have any health problems. They love hay and vegetables. I moved him because of this problem.|Fruit juice is far too sweet for rabbits. And if he has access to other tastier food then he will refuse his hat and vegetables. Is be as strict as you can with limiting his access to other food types and be sure you're offering only a limited amount of pellets per day. Everything else they eat should be fresh salads/veggies and hay. Harry and fiber intake needs to be 90% of their diet. Also some rabbits are just predisposed to dental disease. If it's a chronic problem you should discuss the pros and cons of dental surgery with your vet
what's your favourite animal? do you have a fav specifically to your line of work|I'm a sucker for cats. I love how different their personalities are and think they aren't given nearly enough credit. I also have learned to handle them in the office to make their visit as low stress as possible and it's made working with them such a joy. I also love ferrets and rabbits.
Why is my pug an asshole?|I say this as a pug owner myself
I have a long haired cat that was adopted from a shelter 3 years ago.. so it’s difficult to figure out her age. She’s straight up not eating or drinking. She’s lost half her body weight in the last 6 weeks give or take. I took her to our vet.. labs show she is anemic (hgb 8.3 hct 26) and has elevated liver enzymes.. he didn’t give me the numbers. WBC is wnl. No masses, lumps, nodules.. noted jaundice in her mouth. She’s low energy, but not outright lethargic. She doesn’t have any overt signs of pain.. purring and sweet still. No loose stools, no vomiting, no skin issues.. He gave her a decent sized fluid Bolus that was absorbed within 4 hours, dexamethasone injection and an Rx for liquid abx. Check back in 2 weeks.. I have given her everything I can think of to get her to eat.. we have 6 cats total.. there are water dishes and dry food scattered all over our house.. along with 6 litter boxes. Wet food of various brands, changed the dry food, soft treats, human type tuna, rotisserie chicken, Turkey, roast beef, ice cream.. (I know, but I am desperate) but she sniffs and turns away from everything. What’s the prognosis for something like this?? And what else could I tempt her with?|Sounds like she needs further testing (I'd recommend an abdominal ultrasound) and possibly more aggressive intervention like hospitalization and a feeding tube of you're willing to go that far. Many cats can stop eating for a number of reasons, but once they do they can go into hepatic lipidosis as their liver cannot tolerate the amount of fat their body is breaking down. This causes a snowball effect and progress very quickly and lead to death if you do not intervene aggressively or quickly enough.
My inlaws had a maltease and a minpin. Everytime they went to the vet, they had to get muzzled. Reason being was that the vet always got bitten by smaller breeds, and larger dogs were the nicest. He never wanted to chance it, so most small dogs automatically got muzzled. We eventually went to another vet. My question: Which breeds have been the bane of your existence? Edit: I use ""had"" because they both perished the exact same time due to a horrible accident.|Honestly a lot of small breeds can be easily stressed out while at the vet, but we do Fear Free handling and that seems to help a lot and I'm not even really concerned about getting bit by a small dog since I learn to read their body language and trust my techs with their restraint.
 |I personally get very frustrated with large guard dog breeds since too many owners have no idea how to train or handle these dogs. The most common that comes to mind are German Shepherds. When in the hands of a skilled owner these dogs are awesome love bugs, but far too often they are big babies that can be very dangerous when anxious and not trained properly. Same is true for some Great Pyrenees, Cane Corso, Dogo Argentino and Rottweilers. If I get the slightest side eye from these dogs they get a muzzle because they can do serious harm if they feel cornered or scared. With covid a lot of these dogs actually do better since they come in without the owner and don't feel like they also have to protect their owner while also being scared.
Am I weird for having my rabbits microchipped? Lol|If there is any chance of them escaping then no, but realistically rabbits that escape aren't as likely to be found and caught. I have had owners find and bring in domestic rabbits from outside though so it's not impossible.
What is one thing you wish people would know/understand about their pet?|They aren't people as much as we may want them to be. They have their own needs and desires, their own body language and stressors, and they take time, money, and patience to care for properly. They also feed off our emotions. If you are anxious about bringing your dog to the vet you will teach your dog to be anxious about the vet.
[deleted]|Some puppies normally go through a period of heightened anxiety/submissive behavior as they grow, usually around 6-9 months. It's basically the age that they learn some things are scary or bad. As long as it's not getting worse or affecting they're regular activities I would just keep working on training at home and keep things consistent since dogs like consistent, reliable schedules. If it gets worse consult a trainer or vet
How do you feel about raw feeding cats?|It's risky and takes a lot of money and dedication. If you want to feed raw you should consult a nutritionist for a diet plan and expect to get your meat freshly slaughtered from a butcher. Usually rabbit is recommended. You can not buy meat from a grocery store as this is packaged and intended for cooking and increases risk of salmonella and e. Coli exposure as well as parasites. Also there is some debate now as to who not just cook the meat and feed it? Raw does not offer any different benefits as long as you provide all the right parts. To get cats to eat raw you also need a meat grinder and include bone and other parts to be sure it's balanced. Basically if you're not 110% dedicated I don't recommend it.
I have a bull terrier/pit mix who is fear reactive only outside of the vet (she loses it and starts barking in fear), but the moment she gets inside, she's totally fine (after Trazodone). She's not responsive to toys or treats. She's also fine in our backyard with strangers as well as inside the house. She's on Prozac daily and gets Trazodone before her appointments because she submissive-pees herself otherwise. Is there anything else I can do for her so she's not so stressed out every time she has to see the vet?|Our hospital typically recommend these type of dogs come visit the hospital regularly without any kind of shots or appointment. Just take them for a walk around the hospital or have someone bring them inside for a weight check. In the beginning if she's that anxious you'll need trazodone and possibly even stronger anxiety medications to facilitate the training and desensitization, but the more she goes and nothing bad happens the more she'll adjust. Eventually she should be comfortable enough to take treats while you're there and that should speed up the process. I would call and ask your vet if they would allow out recommend a process like this. They may want to have you give acepromazine or xanax prior to visits if the trazodone and prozac aren't enough
What's the smallest animal you have consulted?|Mice I think... only 20g. When I was in school we worked on some insects or birds that we're smaller. Got to treat a hummingbird before but not recently
Hi there! We have a stray who decided she wanted to live with us a couple of months ago. She’s overall healthy, good weight and appetite but we’ve struggled with her having soft stools (not diarrhea but not fully formed) and being oddly gassy when she’s really happy (purring/etc). We’ve treated her for worms with Bayer Dewormer and outside that do not have any concerns. Any idea what could be causing this and what we can do to help her improve?|If you haven't taken her to a vet to get fecal testing done then I would recommend this. Some broad spectrum dewormers do not cover all parasites and for a previous stray parasites are top of the list. We also see a lot of giardia around here that can take multiple rounds of treatment to clear. Other than that some animals have sensitivities to certain types of food or proteins and cats are prone to inflammatory bowl disease so she may also need a special diet for sensitive stomachs or food allergies.
My 1.5 year old standard Aussie was neutered Monday (5 days ago.) The vet nicked an artery during surgery and he was bleeding a lot the night of the surgery and a bit the morning after. He hasn’t bled since, and seems to be feeling and acting like his normal self. Today though, I noticed his scrotal sack looks pretty big, red and swollen. Is this a cause for concern? Is it supposed to look like this? This is my first dog so I have no idea and I’m worried. Can’t go to the vet as it’s the weekend. Thanks so much|If it's red and swollen go to an ER. Most likely this is a scrotal hematoma. Some can be managed medically but others can need another surgery.
What's the best way of telling a puppy that ""you did bad, don't do it again""?|Take away what ever it is they want when they're acting out. No attention, no toys, no treats. Dogs don't really understand the word ""no"". Some can eventually learn tone of voice, but some dogs like any and all attention, even negative, so if you yell at it for doing something bad you are still rewarding it by giving them attention.
What warnings or encouragements would you give to somebody thinking of going into this field?|There is a lot more to the field then playing with animals. You still are mostly dealing with clients and people all day. You need to really like medicine and science as much or more than animals and you need to be a good communicator. It's a lot of work and a lot of debt for not much pay off compared to the human medical professions. Definitely work in a vet practice and as many other animal related positions as you can before committing financially to vet school. I'm preparation for vet school take as many science courses as you can in undergrad and make your course load challenging. Whatever you face in college will be nothing compared to your workload in vet school so be sure you're ready for the challenge. You also need to learn how to balance your life and take time outside of school for hobbies to be able to succeed mentally as a vet. Too many of my colleagues pour their entire life into the profession and then burn out or become jaded.
Do you plan to pursue board certification in feline medicine? It’s always great to see more cat specialists (my wife is one).|I've considered it, but I'm not sure the time and money investment will really pay out for me. I might eventually go a different direction (practice ownership) first before doing more specialized work. I actually sometimes dream of working at a cat only hospital, but I like working with exotics as well and I think I would miss seeing dogs eventually. Instead I've just almost exclusively gone to AAFP conferences for my CEs the past few years and most of my clients can tell immediately how comfortable I am handling cats and discussing their medicine compared to some other vets.
ahhhhh the farm visits at Tufts. Ever get sick from the cows? Our class had many|I was lucky to not get sick. Had a few classmates that got cryptosporidium while on ambulatory and had a rough time
What are your thoughts on the industry and overall honesty amongst vets? I’ve been to a few vets for my dogs because I find it incredibly hard to find a trustworthy vet that is knowledgeable. One vet couldn’t diagnose my dog’s allergy correctly and we spent $3000 for 6+ office visits and meds. Another vet made me feel like he was trying to make as much money as possible by pushing unnecessary office visits (one charged $72 for each office visit) and trying to have us buy meds directly from him when they were all almost double the price of Chewy or 1800 pet meds.. They both had 4.7-4.8 stars on Google reviews with a couple hundred reviews so my experience with those vets is all the more confusing.|Many vets cannot compete with prices offered by online pharmacies. We physically cannot buy the quantity needed to get such a cheap price and rely on a percentage markup just to help cover overhead. We also see counterfeits coming from some online pharmacies so it's recommended to get the products directly from a vet for the most reliable/safe product. Some vets are definitely better than others. We're all human, but I don't know many that are intentionally dishonest it trying to swindle clients. Most vets are just trying to offer best practices which may mean frequent rechecks until an issue is solved or lots of initial testing. Honestly I find vets that undercharge and under test are typically old school, jaded, and aren't as up to date with the medicine and misdiagnose issues more frequently. The key is to just be as honest and realistic with your vet about your expectations and finances. We always offer the gold standard plan, but could come up with plan b or plan c that isn't as ideal but could possibly get us to the same outcome for cheaper.
What is the job market like for a vet? Would you recommend it to others? Easy or hard to find a job? Is the pay commensurate with the education expenses? Thanks!|Currently with covid vets are in incredibly high demand, so very easy to find a job! The pay varies a lot by location and the debt is very high. Do NOT go into this job for the money.
My 7 yr old beagle mix has had a cough for most of his life. Recently, the vet said it was kennel cough and prescribed amoxicillin. 2 to 3 days after the script ends the cough is right back and no other antibiotics have helped it. What else could it be?|You should go for a recheck and likely need chest x-rays. It could be chronic bronchitis/asthma, heart related, or other primary airway disease. If it improved on antibiotics there could also be a chronic more resistant infection that needs stronger antibiotics or a longer course. To determine this a tracheal wash and culture is usually performed..
Are there any reputable places to get good information on diet questions? My vets typically don't want to get into it, and I think a lot of internet sources tend to demonize certain ingredients without a ton of evidence either way. Take grain-free diets for example - they are constantly lauded as superior but studies have shown they can cause heart issues in dogs. I just want to feed my cats food that is healthy and wholesome and doesn't make them throw up. Currently I feed my cats raw chicken from Hare Today and leave dry kibble (Hills science diet for 6m kitten, Royal Canin sensitive stomach for older cat) out for them to graze. However my older cat still throws up occasionally, and my kitten farts like the devil himself and has soft poops that get stuck on his butt fluff. I just want to make sure I'm doing right by them.|I love the vet nutritionists at Tufts and UC Davis. Tufts has a full website for pet owners to navigate all of the different questions surrounding pet foods and summaries of the most current research. https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/
What is student loan repayment like for the average vet?|I'm in the US and most of my peers graduated with 250+k in loans since each year was about 70k when I attended. Most of us cannot afford to pay monthly on a 20yr or 25yr plan and instead do income based repayment which means your loans grow more in interest before you can pay down the principle and then after 30yr the remaining loan is forgiven but you pay income taxes on that amount. I was lucky to have a full scholarship for undergrad so all of the money my family and I saved for college went toward vet school. I still graduated with over 100k in debt but was able to afford the $1000- $800/mos payments with a normal repayment plan and so I didn't need to worry about IBR
What species of cat or dog do you think is the cutest?|Dog: corgi puppy, cat: all of them. Ugly cute: bambino cat
Hi, current vet student here. In your opinion, is it generally better to go into practice immediately after school to pay off some debt, or do a residency/ internship before going into practice? I have been struggling with this choice and I'm not sure what I want to do with my life lol|I went into practice straight from school and was so happy I did, but it's not for everyone. It really depends on your personal confidence managing cases and the type of hospital that hires you. If you are planning to specialize either way it's likely easier to just continue on with school and not stop though. If you are still considering gp and feel comfortable starting right away with good mentorship then I don't think an internship is necessary."
m9e3mf,118,2021-03-20,"Advisor/PI is gaslighting me and ignoring me, what should I do? [STEM]",Resident_Willow9359,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/m9e3mf/advisorpi_is_gaslighting_me_and_ignoring_me_what/,"I apologize in advance for the long post. I'm at the verge of nervous breakdown. There are only 5 weeks left until the deadline.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a masters student. My advisor is also my PI and head of the department. I felt like we had a good relationship. We worked together several days a week for 1 whole year. Then the pandemic came and they suddendly stopped replying to my emails. Just before it all started, they promised to get back to me when results come back from another institution. Never heard back. I was supposed to be done with the project in summer 2020.

I emailed them several times, stating my concern about the deadline. Weeks went on, I didn't manage to get in contact. The unis opened for 1 on 1 consultations. When any of the other students went in there, they always reminded my advisor of me and they always said they'd get back to me. I became so unmotivated and filled with anxiety that I gave up. I went there in person in July with someone who managed to schedule a meeting. They denied ever getting any emails from me. I extended my program for a year and it took a huge toll on my mental health.

Next academic year began and I went through some health issues. My advisor appeared to be very sympathetic and said I should get it sorted out and email them once the review part of my thesis is done. The the pandemic blew out again, my doctors appointments were moved a few months later, I had other medical issues and was assaulted, which took me time to deal with. I started writing as soon as I felt strong enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to now, 2021:**

2 months later, I emailed my PI again. Nothing. I tried to call their office but since the uni is closed now, I'm not sure if they're even there. Finally I managed to get them on the phone a week later and they were very upset with me. I asked them how will we proceed further, especially since they have all the results of my experiments and refused to give them to me last summer, insisting I have to show them the whole review part first. They replied that I can do whatever but I won't make it because there's too little time and since the uni's closed, there's no way they can help me - meaning if I can't be there in person, we won't discuss anything and I can't progress. They also said I should extend my program for another year (and pay the tuition of course). They claimed I haven't contacted them during the past year at all. They don't remember I was in their office or that we talked about my health issues, that they appeared to be so understanding of. I was completely shocked and cried for 3 days straight. I don't understand any of this. I asked them to please cooperate and try together. They agreed that I should send them the review. So I did and still nothing. 

I just wanna lay down now, cry and not exist. I worked so hard to get into a good PhD program. The dean offered me a PhD program over the years, twice. I did a lot of extra work and engaged with the department. I found an internship at a prestigious institute. I'm at fault that I didn't try to get my advisor on the phone earlier. I'm at fault that I didn't email them more often. I'm also at fault that I started this late, although I truly believe I'd make it if I had more encouragement. Since they told me to contact them once my whole review is done, that's what I planned to do. Now they acts like none of this happened and claim they never said those things. 

I always liked my advisor/PI, I'm so disappointed. I don't wanna report it because they have all my results. Also they're one of the two people who will be evaluating my thesis and there's a big emphasis on cooperation from the student. I'm so scared. There are only 5 weeks left at this point. I'd very much like to solve this peacefully. I don't know who to talk to. I thought about contacting someone else from the department but there's a good chance it would eventually get to the PI and I'd get in trouble. Technically the only person ""above"" the head of the department at uni is the dean, who appears to be very nice but I have no idea who would he side with. I kind of have a feeling he'd share my complaint with my advisor. All I want at this point is to finish, I don't even care about grad school anymore. I don't know what to do. I hate myself for not seeing this coming after what happened last year. I was stupidly naive to believe it will be different this time.  


What should I do? I don't even feel I have a right to complain since I didn't try hard enough. I regret starting late but I was such a mess mentally before I started because of the assault, which I can't even tell anyone. I truly believe I'd make it in time if we cooperated, many students before me have made it in 4 weeks or so. The stress is killing my productivity though."

m9h8d3,18,2021-03-20,Is it realistic to think I could become a software developer?,Jacklein,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m9h8d3/is_it_realistic_to_think_i_could_become_a/,"Hi everyone. Made a new reddit account since this is pretty identifiable information. This got really long, I hope someone here will take the time to read it, particularly anyone currently employed in the industry.

I got my bachelor's degree in mathematics from a great university in 2020, and I've been programming for a long time. When I was a teenager I was homeschooled and had a strong passion for technology. I taught myself C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Haskell, Perl, x86 ASM, computer architecture, algorithms, basically everything I could. I'd render physical simulations, reverse engineer video games, mess around with Linux, Project Euler, Hackerrank, and so on, probably similar to what a lot of you did as teenagers. I originally intended on studying CS at university, so I've taken the introductory programming courses, data structures and algorithms, web programming, discrete mathematical modeling, scientific computing (solving PDEs with MATLAB), and did well in all of these classes. I also studied a lot of formal logic as that was my main interest, and even got to take a graduate-level-ish course on recursive function theory (basically working up from Turing machines to Godel's incompleteness theorems). And of course I'm trained in mathematics. This is all to say that I have what I think is a lot of quantitative knowledge, talent, and ability, and a fair grasp of the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.

Unfortunately I was dealing with grief and trauma during university and for a while after I graduated, and didn't get much done or apply to many jobs. My GPA took a nosedive to 2.8 in my last couple years, but I was going to graduate with honors in my second major (I double-majored). Now I'm doing a lot better. I've begun teaching myself modern web development as it's one of my weak points and from what I can tell has the most job postings. To learn it I've been iteratively building a portfolio website in TypeScript with React, a UI framework, Express, a bundler, a transpiler, you get the idea. Right now I'm learning sockets and trying to build something like a chess game that can be played by two people from their browsers. Next I'm going to learn MongoDB and try to build something like a forum or a reddit clone. Basically I spend six to eight hours every day reading, learning, writing code, grinding out commits, then starting all over when I realize I was doing everything wrong the first time around. But is it realistic for me to think that a portfolio of well-made projects and a math degree is enough to land me a job? Everything I see is either ""Biology major goes to coding bootcamp for 12 weeks and now works at Google"" or ""I have a CS degree and three internships and have been rejected after 1000 applications"". It's seriously stressful. I live in Seattle, a tech-hub, and you would think that it would be *easier* to find tech jobs in a tech hub, but the only ones I feel qualified to apply for on Indeed are located in Kentucky or wherever (I need to stay near my family). I had a close call for a remote role at a tech company in Austin but got passed over for someone more experienced after the final round and talking to the CEO. I'm afraid that my lack of formal CS education or any CS internships is going to make it impossible for me to get hired. The role in Austin ended up having *1500+* applicants! I only made it so far because I got lucky in applying for it the same day they posted it.

Basically what I want to know is whether anyone here who has a job as a developer thinks it's actually realistic for me to work as one. I'm terrified that I'm wasting my time pursuing this. I've been unemployed for a long time and it's starting to feel pathetic. I go on LinkedIn and see that the CS/IT majors I used to help with their programming homework are working at tech companies, while I sit here with my math degree wondering if I should get a job at a grocery store. I would greatly appreciate any advice, criticism, guidance, whatever. I'm a first-generation college student and I really don't have any connections or mentors or anything and am kind of just walking in the dark. If you read through this whole thing, I appreciate it."

I ended up in research, and began filling a data analytics role (mainly just R with tidyverse, bioconductor, and using PRISM). I definitely developed decent soft skills, like a ton of project management, cross team collaboration, ect.

Decided data analytics wasn’t in my alley, and here I am doing a M.S. Software Development from a Top 50 school. Data structures/algorithms, software patterns, and such are part of the curriculum. I love the program and everything I’m learning, and feel like development is within my interests. 

I hear a lot about how CS degrees are the gold standard for hiring. Now that I’ve been learning the practical stuff, and enjoy it, I’ve been pondering if it might be worth taking a stab at more theory and give myself a fighting chance at landing an internship.

Or should I just work with what I got, focus on fun projects, leetcode + algoexpert, maybe bootcamp, then apply directly for internship?"

It looks significantly easier to get a software developer job right out of college versus now. 

Earlier today I watched a video where someone documented their experiences as a professional software developer. They started by doing an internship on a platform they didn't even have experience with going in. Building their skills from there they were able to progress. Internships look like a great way to learn and grow as a developer but as far as I know they are only available tonl students. 

Does anyone know companies that have internships/apprenticeships for people who are currently not students?"

Biased teachers in high school cost me my chance to get into any of the colleges I wanted to go to and I ended up going to a decently ranked local college that has no standards in accepting locals. Despite all the effort I put in, I failed to get a single internship despite living in the heart of silicon valley.

The only reason I even got in my first job, Cisco, was because the WITCH needed warm bodies. New Year of 2020 came around and my then manager announced that my contract was about to end and even though I got to interview within Cisco for new contracts, I failed to get anything. Few months later into covid, I lost both the contract and the consulting job due to the lack of contracts that fit my skillset that don't require relocation as I was only making half of what everyone else was making.

For the entire 15 month duration with over 30000 applications shotgunned during every chance I get and dozens of phone screens, I managed to get a grand total of only one single onsite from Amazon for a job I didn't even apply for only to fail it and get barred from making any applications in the system for a year. I've done everything and resorted to everything; cold contacting recruiters and even opted to apply to outright scams. Even with resume reviews, rewrites, and a class on writing resumes ended up fruitless. 

I honestly can't tell if this is normal or the world is working against me at this point. I've lost all the people I've ever cared about as they've all moved on pretending I don't exist and the few connections I managed to get referrals from only accelerated the wait for a rejection from weeks to as little as 8 hours via manual review. Even one of the screenings straight up said they're dismissing my freelance work as not ""real"" experience. At this point, even my own family is saying that I should just give up the job hunt and go back to school but are trying to force me back into the college I graduated from to keep me under a tight leash. Despite the requirement for multiple rec letters, which I have no one who will offer to write when asked.

I have no option but to keep applying but these nonstop failures, losses, ghosting, and constantly being put down is taking its toll. I've lost all passion for the engineering field after monotonously applying for jobs day in and day out for over a year but I don't have anything else that I'm skilled at. Can I really get anything with just a little over a year of professional experience? Did I make a mistake in choosing my career path?"

Right now my entire free time is replaced with college assignments, a personal project and doing research for my undergraduate thesis topic. 

It takes me an insane amount of time to undertand the source code given as example in lectures and tutorials. This is where it all ends, because I usually just copy code snippets and adapt it to my needs, I don’t remember the last time when I put together more than 3 lines of code on my own. 

I do the same thing when I build my side project: I just follow a tutorial line by line because I would never be able to write something from scratch. 

Honestly, I don’t know why it takes me so much to understand code. My mind simply refuses to see the logic behind, even if I have the theoretical fundamentals. It’s so frustrating to have zero free time, stay +12 hours in front of a computer and eventually achieve nothing. I’m still behind. 


TL;DR: I don’t manage to understand source code from lectures and tutorials or write it from scratch. This makes me so stressed because I have to take part in internships in order to graduate and I just know that I won’t be accepted anywhere with my poor technical skills. 

Is someone going through the same phase?"

I'm hundreds of applications deep and I've only had one single interview, because of this I've had no feedback whatsoever. 

I've recently been putting 100% of my time into building my own market ready software, but I have nothing to fall back on. 

I'm applying to all junior jobs, typical titles are junior python dev, junior back end dev, junior DevOps engineer, junior it support, junior software engineer. 

I'd consider my main tech stack to be Python and Linux but I've got a pretty high level of skills across a range of areas. 

Results from my last interview; 'your skills and attitude are excellent, and you've done nothing wrong; however we will be moving forward with another applicant who has 5 years of experience - regardless of what salary you will be happy with'. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to apply to anymore. Clearly I'm somehow not applicable for junior dev roles. I'm 6 months into a voluntary unpaid software dev position. 

I have &lt;2 months to get a job. If I can't find one, I'll be leaving my pursuit of a career in software behind. So I guess my questions are:

So far I have applied to around 50 internships related to electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or Electromechanical engineering. I have had 3 interviews so far; two turned me down, 1 offered me a job. I have one more interview set up with a company for this Tuesday. 

The job offer that I already have is not bad. I would have my own office, making $20 an hour in a very nice workplace. Unfortunately it's not really what I want to do. I would be doing invoices, quotes, supplier relations etc and I want to be hands on and gain that type of experience. It's also only 10 weeks at 40 hours a week. 

The place I am interviewing with on Tuesday I have already had a phone interview with and it seems much better. They would hire me starting in May and let me work all through August. It's 40 hours a week but I have the option to work up to 9 hours a day 6 days a week if I desire but it's completely optional. And they'll let me work part time when school starts again in the fall. I would be doing hands on assembly of pcbs and ""electromechanical equipment"". I can come in anytime between 7 and 9 and leave either 8 or 9 hours later. They seemed great on the phone and when I told them I already had a standing job offer they said on Tuesday they will let me know right there and then if they want to hire me. I think this means they already want to hire me as long as the interview goes well. The only thing that isn't optimal is that it's $15 an hour.

I think I have a good chance of getting this job on Tuesday, they seem to like me on the phone, I have a strong portfolio and resume, and I have some very solid references for robotics and work experience that are both very fond of my work with them. I know if they offer me the job I will take it as the experience and flexibility is without a doubt better, but it pains me that it's paying $5 less an hour than the other offer. I want to ask if they are able to be competitive with pay but they are a small company with ~25 people and I don't know if they really can compete with the $20 an hour. I also don't want to ask for more and seem only interested in the position for the money and lose this great opportunity. Should I ask if they can be more competitive with my other offer? Should ask on Tuesday if we can renegotiate at a later when they've had the chance to see the work I can do? If possible I want to close the gap between the two offers a bit, but I don't want to risk my chance of getting the job on Tuesday. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

Started off as an intern and have worked my way up to the top sales rep at the company (small, 15 employee company with 5-6 salespeople). I’ve made the company more money than anyone in the last 4 years.

I am paid commission and I make a good living. However, as some of you will understand, money isn’t everything.

The culture is terrible. There is no real leadership. It’s basically “go close deals on your own and we take most of the money”. 

I haven’t received a raise to my base salary in 8 years. All raises have been on commission from deals closed.

For about 9 months now I’ve been just doing my own thing and talking to nobody else at the company. I was criticized for being disengaged, When all of a sudden, the president of our company asked me to take on a new and crucial role. We met, I expressed interest but told him they needed to make me an offer.

She said she would, but 2 months went by and I never heard from her. So I called her and I got some long explanation about why they never got back to me that made no sense. Nevertheless, they never made an offer.

So fast forward 2 more weeks and I sit down with the owner and tell them their business has fractures and is suffering and I find it disrespectful that there is no leadership and the company never made me an offer when they said they would. In response I was basically told that it’s my fault and that it wasn’t anything they did.

It was an adult conversation that left both sides unhappy.

Fast forward 2 more weeks and we meet again. They say they feel bad and want to make me happy by offering higher commission and maybe a bonus. 

Problem with my industry is deals might get closed once or twice in YEARS. The sales cycle is incredibly long and infrequent. And maybe a bonus? Lol. Say no more.

I’ve worked here for long and I am turning to Reddit to gain a perspective from others in the professional world. What do you think is going on? What do you recommend? Why won’t they just make me an offer like I feel I deserve?"

ma3nug,44,2021-03-21,"[JC] Really jammed packed with a lot of external work experiences (internships, personal startups, apprenticeships) and portfolio stuff but grades are average at best. Advice?",satoshigekkouga2303,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ma3nug/jc_really_jammed_packed_with_a_lot_of_external/,"Saw that a lot of JC students here excel in studies while struggle to put together a portfolio, well I’m the exact opposite. My studies are average at best (I’d even consider it below average most of the times) but the past year (2020) has allowed me to really go nuts with my portfolio and work experiences. The below description I’m about to write is pretty unique imo and those that know me would probably be able to identify me through this post easily, not even gonna bother exposing my alt acc lol, so hi if you know me. 

2020 was a horrible year for many of my peers but the lockdown was honestly a positive experience for me. My school had internship programmes for the IP student at the start of the year and the J1 IP students got to attend different ‘internship’ experiences. I was chosen for an iOS development job and it was honestly pretty meh. But it got me interested in iOS programming and eventually I started tinkering around. I’ll cut to the chase and just say that I eventually got to work with professional overseas developers and designers from America and Australia to develop an app for a niche community. We eventually registered ourselves a company/startup in Australia and I have a stake in the company myself. Most of the development process took place during the covid lockdown and my teacher was super supportive of my work (I take H2 computing). I took the time to explore further into web and UI/UX development and eventually picked up various skills pertaining to UI design as well as frontend development. Some of them include Figma designing, Vue and React etc. 

During the December holidays, I also worked as an apprentice of sorts with an American dev based in Korea and got to contribute and learn a thing or two from him. The experience furthered my knowledge in frontend development and design. Fun tidbit, a lot of developers I work over the net often think I’m working full time on a dev job or something 😂

Currently, I am working with a peer at a local tech startup as interns. Progress has slowed down a bit due to March Tests for J2 but it’s definitely a cool experience for myself. 

During 2020 I also participated in a ton of competitions and events related to computing and I was personally part of my school’s MUN CCA and a few others as well. I’m still in the same CCAs and also doing my part in a variety of projects by them. Unfortunately, due to A levels, I’ve had to start cutting down on my commitment and instead shift my focus to more school-based projects and I am definitely attempting to invest in various ventures in school that has potential to grow further. 

There’s a few more further achievements I have in terms of secondary school and JC CCA records but I think I’ll just leave the rest out for now. 

My Teachers have all reacted positively to my ventures and currently it’s really a tossup between those who feel that I should cut down on my external ventures and those who feel that I should pursue them further. And yes, I have consulted my school’s career counsellors, seniors etc etc. Again, it’s split, all of them say that it’s a good thing but not all support me going all in on entrepreneurship and stuff. As strong as my ‘portfolio’ might seem, I’m honestly just lost rn. My Sec 1-4 life was honestly really mundane and nothing much occured other than the few trophies brought back from my past CCA. All of a sudden, I’m working with professionals from across the globe and also balancing my studies. My grades are honestly not the best and it hurts to know that I’ll have to cut back on my passion to study something I have no interest in. As much as I invest in tech, I’m a humanities and arts person myself and choosing a suitable future Uni course has been really difficult. 

Any tips, suggestions and advice regarding higher education (or future work) are welcomed! And to maybe turn the conversation a bit, feel free to DM me if you wanna find out more about development, networking and whatever portfolio stuff lmfao"

How are you doing now?,WashUsimp,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ma42in/college_students_older_people_of_a2c_what_was/,"I’ll tell you my sister’s story:

Her dream school(s): MIT &amp; CMU

Where she ended up at: Community college and then transferred to UW Seattle computer science

She just landed an internship at Intel, and last year she interned for Amazon.  My sister, like everyone else, was crushed when learning that she was rejected from all of her top choice schools. She got accepted to her safety in Oregon, but the cost was too high so she decided to enroll in a local community college instead. That saved us roughly 20-30k a year and more of our parents saving could go to my college fund ( thanks, sis &lt;3). She had  good stats (&gt;3.95 UW, 1500+ sat) and top notch ECs (ISEF level research etc), but let’s not dive too much into her qualification. She also met a wonderful boyfriend at her CC, who then also transferred to UW with her. My sister told me she was more fulfilled in her 4 years of college than she had ever been. She worked her stellar ass off, and she deserved everything. UW and CC weren’t her dream schools at first, but she made her journey there a dream came true. So a friendly reminder to all the lost souls out there: college is truly what you make out of it. Sure going to a t20 will provide you more opportunities and connections (and also bragging rights).

ma4sn7,1,2021-03-21,Confusion between me and an employer who is hiring an unpaid intern,Conflicted134,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ma4sn7/confusion_between_me_and_an_employer_who_is/,"Hey reddit! I’ve been a lurker on this sub for a while now and I have a situation that I would love some advice on. Basically there’s been a miscommunication between me and an employer that’s hiring an unpaid intern to work at her sport marketing/PR firm and I’m not sure how to handle it.

Some basic facts about me – I’m 24F and I graduated in 2018 with an undergraduate bachelors of music with a concentration in music industry. I had been working in my field as an assistant account manager for a few years at a PR firm for musicians until pandemic hit in March, when we lost 50% of our business literally overnight. I was laid off a few months later and have been searching for work in the meantime with limited success. I’ve taken on a few random freelance projects and I’ve been teaching music lessons to garner some income but I haven’t gotten any job offers yet.

A very close contact of mine connected me with this particular employer, mentioning that they were hiring and this person could be a good contact for other opportunities. Now, this miscommunication could have started when my contact introduced us, when they offhandedly mentioned to this employer that I could be interested in learning more about the position she had available, but I genuinely don’t think they saw that it was an unpaid internship, otherwise they wouldn’t have said that. I clearly stated in my various email correspondence with this employer that I was only interested in picking her brain for a purely informational interview. She took a really long time getting back to me, and actually missed our first set time to talk, but when she sent me a Zoom invite the title said “Internship Interview”. This took me by surprise because I didn’t think I had indicated any interest in applying for the position, only learning more about her company and career. It’s very possible that she just skimmed my emails and didn’t look at my resume, but I took some offense to this. I am clearly overqualified for this job, I have over 2 years of experience managing client accounts and scoring press hits, why would I take an unpaid internship to do the same tasks? Also, I’m not a college student, I’m an adult with bills and student loans. I can’t afford to take an unpaid job.

I did some research and I found out that unpaid internships are illegal unless they meet all seven of the criteria set out by the [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships). I clearly violate points 2, 3, 4, and 6, at least. To address points 2, 3, and 4, again I’m not a student so I can’t receive academic credit or some other comparable academic compensation. And to address point 6, the job description for this unpaid internship reads like a paid position. For example, in the description it says “From day one of the internship, you’ll be working on creating and implementing campaigns that create exposure, as well as innovating how the company presents to, interacts with, and expands its customer base.” And under responsibilities it says, “Collaborate with the company and client brand teams to determine campaign goals and to build appropriate strategies.” It is illegal for an unpaid intern to replace a paid employees work, and correct me if I’m wrong, but an intern’s job is not to innovate the company interacts with clients, their job is to shadow, learn, and help with admin tasks. I know that at my last PR firm the interns were not expected to play an active role in big picture company directions. It also says that you must be working towards a bachelors degree in a related field, which I am not.

This woman literally might not have read my resume or looked at my LinkedIn at all, but it’s clear that I am not the right fit for this job. I’m offended both if this was laziness on the employer’s part or if they actually expect to hire an experienced candidate for an unpaid position and I feel an obligation to point all of these things out to her when we speak in the next few days.

I mean I know the job market is tough right now but this is just ridiculous. How can I politely inform her that she’s courting trouble with the Department of Labor if she continues this way and that I am not interested in this position at all?"

This might not be the type of question normally asked here but I wasn't sure where else to submit it. I am a computer science student with an internship set for this summer. I was wondering if internships were a suitable substitute for research given the prospect that I might pursue a master's in CS at some point? Although, I may just finish my bachelor's and go straight into the industry, which I'm assuming an internship would be better for. 

Thank you in advance for any advice."

[IL - USA]",ForkLiftBoi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ma76m4/ex_manager_45_adult_male_that_sexually_harassed/,"Hello,

I had a supervisor about 3-4 years ago that was sexually harassing me and going over the line of sanity. When it all came down to it I had 23-24 pages of documentation against him. I point blank told my company (fortune 500) that if he was not fired I was okay with leaving the company as an intern and not looking back.

He ended up being fired and wrote on his tumblr, ""I will right those who wronged me."" I knew historically he had aggressive felonies and aggressive crimes related to a previous life. I never judged him for that, but after that statement on tumblr it freaked me out.

Recently he reached out to me in January, said he had a new phone number. Great I can add it so I know if he tries to contact me.

Then later that month he sends me pictures of his new house, as if I cared. 

Then he sends me a very very very lewd text message on 3/1/2021. It said (warning, nsfw) &gt;!I'd still pay 1,000 to lick ur hole and swallow that load NSA!&lt;

Then this weekend he started trying to send me $100 on every thing he could think of. Cash App, Venmo, Paypal, etc. So I immediately returned all of them and blocked him.

Then he emailed me 

&gt; ""Just need 10 minutes of your time It can be through text but I would like closure. I am not mad at you for what you felt compelled to do.

&gt; Please allow me this and I will be out of your life for good. ""

It would be one thing to have that discussion, but it doesn't help that he sexually harassed me within contacting me in the past few months.

I'm noticing the frequency of this is going up. 

I wish he would just get a fucking therapist for closure. He told me ""what you felt compelled to do."" I think he has genuinely not recognized he did anything wrong.

I have tried to call both the sheriff's office in my county and the other major counties. The one in my county left a message. The one in the other major county said call the states attorney's office monday.

Where do I go from here?

What are the risks of getting a restraining order?

What will the process be?"

5. 8th place at Irish Dance Regional Championships (out of 50+ people)

**Letters of Recommendation**

*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.*

* APUSH teacher: 8/10. I’ve had this teacher for homeroom since freshman year and was in his APUSH class junior year. It was a tiny class, so he got to know me really well. Plus I heard from upperclassmen that he writes really good recs.

* Math teacher: 6/10?? I’ve had this teacher for 2 years and always did well in her class. Not sure about her quality of writing but I hope it was ok. 

* Counselor: 4/10. I talked to my counselor twice (?) in four years. One of my friends got to see her rec and said it was pretty shitty. 

* Dance teacher: 10/10. I basically self-taught myself dance for 8 years then joined a formal dance school at 13. It’s unusual to start dancing this late, but I progressed through the levels super quick and became one of the first champion-level dancers in my studio in just 3 years. I have a super close relationship with my teacher and I think his letter definitely stood out. 

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

* Brown Video Portfolio: 5/10. It barely said anything about me other than basic stuff I already said in my essays.

* Northwestern: 9.5/10. I was a little nervous since this was my first interview, but my interviewer ended up being SO nice and I loved talking to him. 

* Cornell: 8/10. It was really informal and just felt like a casual conversation. I asked her a lot of questions about stuff she did like travel abroad.

* Dartmouth: 7/10. It was supposed to be 30 minutes, but we ended up talking for more than an hour. She was really interested in my ecs and asked pretty standard questions, but I definitely tripped up a few times. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

* Common App Essay: I took my love of origami plus a personal challenge I faced and spun it into a narrative. No mention of my ECs or intended major, just a story that I think is an important part of me. Everyone I gave it to really liked it, a few people told me it was the best essay they’ve seen anywhere and cried reading it.

* Supplements: Iffy. Some of them I loved, some of them I just threw together and hated. One of my weaknesses is that I’m a really good writer in terms of style/word choice/making it sound good, but in my honest opinion, some of my essays (esp the earlier ones) lacked “meat” if you know what I’m talking about. 

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Delaware Honors + 5k per yr merit (EA)
* Loyola Maryland + 30k per yr merit (EA)
* Villanova (EA)
* Case Western Baker-Nord Scholars + 26k per yr merit (RD)

*Waitlists:*

* Emory, both campuses (RD)
* Boston College (RD)
* Dartmouth (RD)

*Rejections:*

* Brown (ED)
* Northeastern (EA, deferred to RD)
* Johns Hopkins (RD)
* Northwestern (RD)
* Vanderbilt (RD) 
* Duke (RD)
* Cornell (RD)

**Additional Information:**
Both my state and my school are tiny, so there’s a good chance someone will read this and recognize me (in that case, hi, this is a little awkward isn’t it lol?)

If I were to assess myself right now, I’d say that my main weakness is that I literally had no intention of going OOS till halfway through high school year, so I don’t have a spike or any sort of tailored narrative.  

As of posting I’m still waiting on more than half of my decisions and will update as I get them. Admissions really are a crapshoot this year and I’m not feeling so good after that NEU rejection... we’ll see how it goes ig"

This internship is the only income I expect to have this year so I would be paying about about ~2400 extra in taxes over that 4 month period.

I don’t mind waiting until tax time to get the money back but I heard about T1213 form that I can submit to the CRA to request to reduce deductions at the source. Looking at the form it looks like it wants you to list specifically why you are deducting and provide supporting documents. I’m not sure if they would even accept “Im just working for 4 months” as a valid reason lol. Is the going down this path even worth it?

I'm starting my career and realized some very concerning  paths it would lead my life into. I really enjoy to learn and improve my skills to build new projects, but I'm already feeling burnt out and anxious about the future and the pressure to be on top of the constant renew of required tech skills. Often caught myself looking out the window, wishing to be able to enjoy my life and time more than being in front of the computer 2~4 hours learning and 9~10 hours doing a job that is frequently boring, stressing or unfulfilling. I believe most of you sometimes have the same thought too, specially with this pandemic.

So... I decided that the only way I could get out of this situation is educating myself and becoming financially independent of a job salary income. This way I can avoid staying in a bad job just because of the money, being able to look for good a company/team and take my pace to learn things without feeling like I'm in a race against time.

Due to my country situation(economically and politically speaking) I cannot trust that this objective is achievable, if I don't ""spread my wings"" and look out for a job in another better reality I may get into trouble in a not so far future.

Finally, I would like to ask you for some tips, knowledge, experiences, histories, prophecies about getting a job as a foreigner that could help me in a future job hunt(some objective questions below). I know my path to this goal may be long, so I need to fix it early

Personal context: I'm in my mid-20ies. Learning(by myself) and interested in backend development/devops. Finishing C.E. graduation, already had few internships and currently working in a Full time job as a Jr/Mid-level dev for less than a year, using mostly node/aws.



TLDR questions, please feel free to leave your thoughts:
1. Honestly, is it viable to get a job from outside NA/EU? (Remote preferably, in any english based company/country)
2. Job Security: is there any? (Considering that I would've to leave my current ""stable"" job)
3. Legality: should I be worried about legal obstacles? (or something related)
4. Focus: What should I persue to achieve this goal? (Leetcoding? Projects? Courses? Experience? Stacks?)
5. Communication: Do I need to achieve a certified proficiency level of english or being able to communicate is enough? (Also, please feel free to judge my current english level given the circumstances)
6. Applying: Should this be done normally? Is there any filtering that HR or Recruiters use to deny me an interview/job?



If there are anything else related you could share I would really appreciate!

Sorry for the long post and thanks very much for your time!"
mafrlb,0,2021-03-22,Just pressed charges against my own father during a physical altercation with me and my mother,Ky1otastic,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/mafrlb/just_pressed_charges_against_my_own_father_during/,"I'm posting this on a burner account since I do NOT want any of my friends (Excluding close friends) to find out what had just transpired not a few hours ago. I'm flairing this as Canada since I am currently living in Canada at the moment. I do not have any legal or law experience which is why I am posting this here.

To make a long story short, my father made physical contact with my mother prior to when I stepped in and intervene. I am a 22 year old man who is able to make his own decisions and handle my own independantly. This all started when my father called me down for dinner and unfortunately since I am pummeled with work since I work as an intern at a computer company they ask us to do a lot of tasks and projects. I was busy tying up some loose ends for work before I head down for dinner and I said. ""Ok, I'll be down in a few. What's for dinner?"" After saying that, he doesn't respond. I assume that he understood that I was busy and all and while this was building up I was busy listening to some music to help me stay focused on finishing my work.

&amp;#x200B;

While finishing my work for the day, I start hearing noises downstairs, I then noticed they were talking about me saying that I'm selfish and rude for asking what was for dinner for some stupid reason. Upon hearing the shouting match downstairs I decided to venture down only to see my father shove my mother. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. Never have I ever ran so fast to my mother. I was like a fucking Olympian during a 100 meter dash. Right as when I jump between them my dad takes a swing and he manages to land a hit on my nose causing it to bleed. Upon seeing the blood come down from my nose I looked in shock and then I hear him say ""GO ON! HIT ME, YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO!"" He shoves me again and then I'm like ""Ok, I'm in danger, my mother is in danger from this tyrant. I need to do something."" So I proceed to defend myself and fortunately before any more damage was done my mom restrained the two of us. He was still hostile towards both me and  my mother so I proceeded to take out my phone and dial the authorities. When I announced I was going to press charges my father screams ""DO IT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS! SEE HOW FAR YOU CAN GET!"" While my mother begs  me not to do it since he has anger issues and isn't able to control his anger.

Being the protective son, and being the man who looks out for my mother I told her that this was for her own good and while I was walking away to talk to the operator in a private room my mother states that doing this would destroy my family and split it apart. I knew the consequences and was ready to take whatever consequences that might lie ahead. Upon talking to the operator and telling her about everything that led up to this point the cops soon arrived soon after that. After they arrived I told them what was going on and proceeded to put my father in handcuffs and arrest him for being charged with second degree assault and domestic violence against me and my mother. After he was taken into custody, the other officer talked to my mother while I got on a call with our family lawyer. After requesting for him to represent me for whatever court proceedings that might occur I was then called to talk with the second officer. That officer told me that if my father is convicted, he would face up to 10 years of jailtime for the charges laid against him which I NEVER intended. I initially thought that it would be a year or so but ten years max? I don't know... At the end of the conversation I am required to come to the station tomorrow afternoon to have the authorities hear my case.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my father is in a holding cell, my mother locked herself in her room while I'm consulting with every close friend I have any researching the law and what to do next which led me here. During this time, I get a call from the station and low and behold, it was my father. For the first time ever, I hear him cry. For the first time in my 22 years on this earth my dad cries. He tells me he is sincerely sorry and begs for my forgiveness. And you know what I said to him? I just said ""Fuck..."" and hung up. I couldn't even muster a proper sentence due to the shock I was going through...

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I want to forgive him and the other hand I want him to get the help he needs which is why I'm going forward with this. I don't know what to do next, I don't know if my family will resent me if my father gets sent to prison. All I want for him is to be sent to a mental institution, 6 month restraining order on me and my mother and probation. Is there any way for me to push for these three possible sentences? I do NOT want to seek jailtime cause I know it will destroy my relationship with my mother and my father's side of the family but in that moment, I believe I had to do what was right. To protect my mother from harm and myself. With that being said, what further actions would I need to take and what possible outcomes might come out from this situation. This is the very first time I am ever pressing charges so I do not know the process on how this all works. All I know is that I need a lot of support to get through this. Thank you for taking your time on helping me out on this. I apologize if this was a long post but I need some help on dealing with this.

&amp;#x200B;

TD;LR: This all started because of me asking ""What's for dinner, I'll be down in a few"" because of work but then it led up to this entire altercation where he laid physical contact on both me and my mother resulting in a bloody nose. I defended both me and my mother from my father and I decided to press charges and I would like to know how to proceed this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Regarding my injuries, I've sustained a bloody nose and some minor bruises. My dad on the other hand has little to no injuries well, excluding emotional injuries... Luckily, my mother intervened before more damage was done. I do know I MIGHT be a liability as well."
mahqdp,6,2021-03-22,Feeling extreme defeat,collinssj,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mahqdp/feeling_extreme_defeat/,"Hi, 2nd year student here. I have been feeling an extreme defeat lately when it comes to school. I have struggled with college pretty much since I got here in Fall of 2019. After my first month I spent pretty much every night crying to myself. I am blessed to have a pretty good home life and had a decent high school experience so I left pretty much everything I cared about behind to go to school, luckily it’s only two hours away but without a license (also caused by my extreme anxiety) any distance is jarring. I met my current boyfriend, who lives near home, things turned around, I hit a low point right before quarantine and then quarantine hit and for the first month or two I was at peace, I was luckily still able to see my boyfriend, I was spending time with my family going on hikes in our woods and long car rides with no destinations, and I was still able to pursue my studies. For the most part I was okay, I started this school year out pretty miserably in the fall semester, I was missing my boyfriend and my family but luckily a friend from high school was a freshman and introduced me to some new people he had met. Again things seemed a lot better, we went online after thanksgiving so I had an extended home stay that was much needed. well that friend dropped out, it was no biggie, I had new friends, well hanging out with them individually in the first month back in the spring made me realize how they really weren’t people I would get along with without that friend, slowly we all went out separate ways, I was lonely once again, my boyfriend was still able to FaceTime me during the week so that was a blessing and helped me get through hard days but every Monday-Friday I find myself waiting miserably for the weekends when I can be back home with him and my family. I enjoy my classes, but the “college experience” of living on campus has me absolutely miserable. I have been trying to make it goal to graduate early as I had the amount of credits to do so, but I recently found out that a class I need to graduate won’t be offered again till spring of 2023, when I was trying to graduate in fall of 2022 or even spring of 2022, and it’s no ones fault but my own, I had forgot my advisor mentioning that to me and asking for special permission from the instructor to do that, this makes me feel inadequate and really stupid to be honest. I have tried to apply for internships but either have heard nothing back or can’t apply because I am behind on school payments and cannot get access to my official transcripts, while simultaneously cannot apply for scholarships to help me prevent this for the very same reasons. I am just feeling really emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. I feel like everything I have tried to do to better my higher education has blown up in my face and I’m really starting to wonder if I was ever cut out for it all, I just want to start my life and spend time with the people I care about most, but I am not so sure anymore if I’m wasting those things away. I want to pursue a career of my passions, but is it really worth forsaking my mental health? And even if I did drop out where would I go? I just feel lost."
maicnb,5,2021-03-22,Is junior year supposed to be this hard???,bthrow42,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/maicnb/is_junior_year_supposed_to_be_this_hard/,"Junior in university here. I just finished finals week this past Friday in a quarter system university, and boy have I reached my breaking point. Ever since George Floyd's death less than a year ago,  I've been really burnt out from college. I overloaded myself on the academic side of things, but then with that tragic event, I felt the wake-up call to treat social activism wayyy more seriously because our world just really be messed up, and social media got really tough to handle, so I stepped away from that for quite a bit. I remember wallowing in sadness and what was probably depression for most of the summer of 2020, simply not having the willpower to get up from my bed, cancelling nearly all of my summer classes, and not feeling comfortable to talk it out to anyone because either 1) I didn't feel close to those who said things like ""if you need anything I'm here,"" or 2) I was under the impression that this was just a battle of willpower. Very bad, yes I know, but I feel my mental health isn't really a recognized topic within my culture and it sucks, so I tried to solo it hard. And the times I was able to force myself to workout and take care of myself got shut down REAL hard when the fires in California made the air quality absolute trash for weeks on end. I got through summer alive but brushed that entire emotional mess off because well, I survived.

When the new school year started, I had a bunch of responsibilities lined up that I had signed up for during spring because well, I go to a tryhard university, and I guess I'm one of those students who loves opportunities but forgets about capacity. One in particular was a club that I helped bring about, and only recently getting myself involved in student leadership, it's been a really different set of responsibilities for me, but I just wanted to grow in the leadership facet of life. But anyways, this club has been draining the living day out of me, with meetings that happen late at night and weekends, board members have so much passion and energy that I just simply can't amount to, and really high expectations for greatness and growth that I feel aren't compatible with my quarantine lifestyle nor capacity. I feel pathetic in my contributions too (and objectively they were, I've had a lot of late/incomplete projects), but I've been too scared to voice out that late night meetings don't work with me. Mental health problems also picked up, but once again, since I didn't really recognize it as an issue, I just tried to battle through it and never voiced out what I was feeling. My progress got worse and worse, and then I would get anxious because I didn't have what I wanted done during our updates, and it just became a positive feedback loop of underperforming --&gt; growing anxiety to work.

Academics have been terrible too. I'm not an engineering major, but I have aspirations to be an engineer, so I'm taking an engineering minor at my school that'll allow me to get the pre-reqs in for an Meng program. I've constantly read on reddit that 3rd year is the hardest for engineers, and I really think that it's true. I don't know what year I would consider myself in the chronology of engineering, because I spent my entire 1st year taking classes for another major that I ended up switching out of, but I caught up to be able to graduate in 4 years. This year, I've just started to dip my toes into the harder engineering classes, and I recently took fluid mechanics this quarter, which was AWFUL. The only reason I did well on the exams was because I spent upwards of 10 hours on them, and there were only 2 problems per midterm. The final was a different story, and I literally pulled an all-nighter to do it, spending probably 20+ish hours on it (literally only 4 questions), but halfway through, I completely SNAPPED and had a horrible breakdown wondering if any of this suffering was worth it only to end up in a job that I most probably could've gotten by going to a cheaper less prestigious school. I would've been able to avoid all of the club stuff too if I just went to another school. I was able to calm myself down to just push through it and make it to spring break. I eventually just gave up on a question, and for my midterm that I had right after, I also just put stuff that I knew was completely wrong, but I was just so tired and rationalized that the full points just weren't worth the health effects I'd inflict on myself. And throughout the quarter, I did not have the capacity to study AT ALL; I had just cruised by all my midterms by referencing the posted problem set keys and taking key strategies from them instead of working things out myself. Btw, this wasn't cheating, since it was referenced that we could use course materials. But regardless, I felt that I had cheated myself from the learning process, and this was a major that I switched INTO, and just half-assing my school just doesn't make any sense.  


AND THEN we have career prospects. I am yet to do an internship in engineering/science because I had to use my first summer in college to catch up, while the second one I canceled a potential offer to study abroad (which ended up being canceled, so I signed up for classes at my home uni). I was way too late looking for internships this fall because I was adjusting to engineering upper divs. But now with nothing technical on my resume and about to go into my last summer, I feel so useless. I've been trying to apply to things, and I've just gotten rejected left and right, which absolutely hurts while you're already just burnt/basically depressed from this entire pandemic. I feel like a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm not a real engineering major, and so I'm just so lost. I'm super grateful to have an interview tomorrow, but I've just been so overwhelmed that I haven't really sat down to prepare yet, and I feel like I'm just letting this opportunity slip from my hands. But even then, even if I were to get this opportunity, I would most certainly not be able to juggle it during spring quarter, and I definitely wouldn't be able to relocate if they go back in person.   


And as an introvert, it seems like the amazing opportunity that I have of going to a prestigious university is crapped. I suck at selling myself and being charismatic, and I have no freaking time to really check out professional opportunities because of the demands of the club I'm in. I'm starting to see how much networking actually matters, and I can't even bring myself to talking at job fairs. Had I gone to another school that was less prestigious, I probably could have gone straight into an engineering major, have all the accreditation and more time to pursue professional opportunities that would at least give me a little bit of certainty post-college.  


I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to study really cool things in a really interdisciplinary field, be apart of the early stage of a cultural club that means so much to my identity, and being offered an interview, but I know I just can't keep living life like this. I feel like I'm on the clock 25/8, expectations are so high, and I'm just too much of a yes-person to speak up or want everything to work so badly. My parents are putting so much money into this degree (which I am grateful for), and I feel like I'm breaking my back just to get by each day, and I'm not even happy, so I feel like it's all just a waste. And once it's all over, not even the measurement of employment seems to be worth it, because as I've said, my resume is just void of relevant experience because I've found myself too busy with social/cultural stuff. Stuff which even then doesn't make me happy.  


Every single one of my journal entries since sophomore year have been about how I can never catch up on things and how miserable life is. As a junior, I'm too young for the nostalgia and celebratory vibes, but too old to be experimenting with commitments. I have enough school experience to feel mega burnt-out, and yet this year seems to be so pivotal for employment. And at the same time, transitioning to upper division classes is difficult. I don't even know anymore. I'm trying to get therapy, but I don't even know where to start. And classes start in a week. I want to pick up myself and finish strong in the commitments I started, but even then sounds so unrealistically heroic, but I don't wanna burn bridges.  


TL:DR - junior year sucks. Everything I'm doing is miserable, and any trade-offs of not pursuing my professional career aren't worth it because I'm burnt out and not enjoying those opportunities either. Snapped only now because of professional uncertainty and how I have no space to further even that. Don't know how to move forward :((((("

I'm a fresh graduate student from a third world country.

And I want your advice on this issue: 

I studied software engineering, And jobs in this country are limiting in a kind of way, We get around 100$ a month for a junior like me and like a 400$ or so for seniors, Now I know it's pretty low compared to the average salaries worldwide.

But there is nothing we can do about it. (long story short we are in a war)

Now we all know this field need experience in order to nail the jobs you want in the company you want, But then again gaining experience means i have to work for a year or more for a 1200$ of salary

which is low like REALLY low for a field I spent 5 years studying.

So what should i do, should i bear it and work for free (almost) or just try to nail a remote job or a internship outside (which is hard now due to corona virus and having no experience)."

2 years student assistant at Uni working with programming +
8 months internship exp with a big automobile company in Project management +
Have an upcoming 6 month internship in Amazon operations, logistics

Due to my profile taking a more industrial engineering turn with project management and operations im wondering if I should consider a masters in management or just in general try to find a job with a lot of work communicating with others. But at the same time all my grades at uni are better in mathematical and analytical subjects and hence data science and investment banking is also interesting to me.

Does anyone have advice on how to move forward?"

I am new on r/cybersecurity, and I know there are probably a million posts of similar nature as this one, however I would appreciate some first-hand advice, if possible.

I am a 3rd year Computer Security student at a Canadian university. Realistically, the program is pretty much just CompSci for 5 semesters, and then the last three semesters there are some courses on Security, Cryptography, Networks, etc. 

Due to Covid, the 2 internship job offers that I received got cancelled as the companies do not want to take interns when work is not in person (understandable, imho). Now, I am looking for internships in the summer (it's kind of late so it might be unlikely I will get a job), but if that's not possible, I would really be aiming for a fall internship. 

As far as my Security knowledge goes, I am pretty much a beginner. I understand the basic security concepts (taken 1 course), networks (2 courses), linux/unix. As far as languages goes, I know Java, Eiffel, C, JS, SQL, C#. I am also planning to take the CompTIA Security+ exam this summer. I have really good grades and work really hard if that even matters.

I was wondering, what would be the best places to start to learn in order to build my security career? I am mostly interested in Network Security, Vulnerability Assessment and Pentesting but honestly, everything security related interests me. Any companies that would be willing to take an intern with my skillset?

Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any kind of feedback, and it is nice to meet you all."

malnoo,79,2021-03-22,When Applying Consider Alumni Networks,Lo_Professor_Phantom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/malnoo/when_applying_consider_alumni_networks/,"Whether you are planning to go to college or already enrolled in college (high schools may even have them), one of the best things you can do for yourself is tap into the alumni network. Nearly every school has one and if you look at college as an investment, an alumni network is one of the best returns on investment available to you.

Many students look at college as a means to getting a job - this is not a value judgement. In that sense, college is a stepping stone to another phase of life. Tap into the alumni network to make sure that the college stepping stone is as effective as possible

Alumni networks are typically groups of people who have graduated from a certain institution. To be sure, most institutions have official alumni networks but also have some sort of unofficial alumni network. Official alumni networks typically require official membership alongside a membership fee. As a member of the official alumni network, you may get benefits like access to certain school facilities, invitations to social events, sporting event tickets, or other programs offered by the institution. If you are not a member, then your benefits may be limited. Whether or not to join is a personal decision. For example, do you live close enough to the institution that access to facilities matters? Likewise, do you live close enough for tickets to a sporting event to motivate you? Are you interested in attending these social events? Personally, I lived far away from my institution once I graduated and I was more interested in socializing in different ways so I never joined. Despite this, I recognized the incredible professional opportunities afforded by an alumni network. 

To that end, I benefited greatly from my institutions' unofficial alumni networks. Even if you are not a member of the official alumni network, that does not preclude you from interacting with alums. Successful alums often want to hire people from their alma mater and they don’t care if you are in the official club or not. As a professor, I have had so many industry professionals ask me to put out a call for internships and tell me that they have a job opening they’d like to fill with a fellow alum. Incidentally, the students who seemed to have the most success out of college have already made good impressions on alums. 

As a professional, I got my first job because of my alumni network. Here’s the kicker though, the guy who hired me didn’t even go to my school - he was just a big fan who had a history of hiring alums from my school. I was put in touch with him through an alum who had previously worked with him. Beyond that, having these unofficial networks allowed me to explore opportunities and collaborations with all kinds of folks. 

These conversations often but not always lead to comments like: “I can introduce you to someone,” “My company is looking for someone,” Do you know so and so? They are looking to hire someone.” 

A multitude of psychological research studies confirm that people are more attracted to those who share similarities with them. In this case, going to the same school gives people a reason to like each other. This could be the difference between getting the job you are after and not getting the job you are after. This is also tied into identity research but I won’t belabor that point. In short, people generally have pride in their schools and a sense of loyalty to them. Even if you don’t identify with your school you can still leverage the alumni network.

As much as I would like to say that I got where I am because of my ability, my alumni network helped me so much on my path. It would be arrogant and untrue to claim otherwise. Whether you are looking at colleges, in college, or a recent graduate, do yourself a favor and look into it. There are all kinds of ways that colleges are measured. The strength of the alumni network should be valued highly. You can be the best student at your school but you still need someone to offer you a job. To borrow an old adage, it’s not what you know but who you know. Make sure you know the alumni network."

My problem is this: there's somehow never enough time. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I'm unable to do most of the things I want to. Both my partner and I want to work in academia down the line which is (and I know I'm preaching to the choir here) time-consuming and stressful; but where my partner is at least able to juggle a 3.9 GPA with two internships, I go to bed every night thinking of how I accomplished nothing throughout my day, nor do I make any reasonable progress.

mao0u8,2,2021-03-22,Which master's programme?,Fancy-Stress-806,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/mao0u8/which_masters_programme/,"Hi guys. Need some advice on choosing between USC, UCLA, UChicago, Columbia for an MS in Data Science/Business Analytics/Analytics. I'm an international and have an undergraduate degree from the UK. Hence, I'm quite unfamiliar with the US institutions. I am leaning very heavily towards the school with the best following criteria:

1. Career resources and support

For example, MIT Sloan MBAn (Business Analytics) makes students do an Analytics capstone project during the spring term in conjunction with their studies and then pursue a full time internship in the summer. So effectively, they're matching students with companies and hence 'giving' their students jobs, no one leaves with nothing (I may be misinformed but this is what I asked from my friend currently in their programme). I want something similar or at least close to this.

2. Living area in general

Hope everyone is doing well. I just had a specific circumstance that I want to ask you guys about. So I accepted an internship for this coming Summer of 2021 with a company. This company offered me a base rate of 37$ per hour as a Software Engineering Intern WFH. I was happy enough with the offer so I went ahead and accepted it in the February of this year. Recently, I heard that there were interns (whom of which I know in real life), that are getting paid more than me (41$) for the exact same role from the exact same city (WFH). I feel like this is pretty unfair and that everyone in the same place working for the same company in the same role should get paid the same (for an internship specifically). **Do you guys think it is worth for me to bring this up to my recruiter?** I personally do not care that much about the money, but it's more about the principle in general. In addition, I do not even know if companies will change the offer letter this late in the game after me accepting the offer a month ago. 

I know someone who was in a similar position except that they had not accepted the offer yet. They reached out to the recruiter and got their salary bumped up to match those other interns, so I know that they are willing to do this in general. Just not so sure if I have already accepted the offer. 

Another thing is since **I have already accepted the offer** so I feel like if I write the email wrong, it can make me look really bad as an intern (someone who is solely interested in the money etc). Another thing to take into account is that my recruiter is working to do team matching right now, so if I get on his bad side, that may make things worse for me. I would really appreciate some guidance on this issue! Thanks so much guys!!"

I was accepted into both SLO and UCI for Computer Science, and I’ve been reading great things about opportunities at Cal Poly in regards to internships and jobs after graduation since employers love SLO students. Yet, I’m in love with the Irvine area and the overall environment.

Plus, with me being a Muslim Asian American minority, I feel like it’d be difficult for me to feel in place at SLO. I haven’t gotten FAFSA results from Irvine yet, but I think in terms of financial stability, SLO would be cheaper.

I’m extremely passionate about my major, and I’m willing to put in the effort to network and do side projects while I’m in school. My questions for CS majors would be, was it a struggle to obtain internships? How do you feel about your overall experience, and what is your honest opinion on the program itself?

Does anyone have any tips about finding a job as a Frontend Developer in Berlin?

I have a bachelor's degree in dental technology and I worked 12 years as a dental technician. In my country, dental technicians work very long hours and don't earn a lot of money and what eventually happened was that I had two burnouts, one after the other. At that time, I decided that enough was enough and I was getting sick because of my job and I decided to quit dental technology for good.
Me and my wife moved to Berlin and I started studying HTML and CSS as self-taught as a hobby and I really liked it, so I decided to do a career change into tech.

For the last 2 years, I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript as self-taught and last year I decided to take advantage of the lockdown situation and I did a remote coding Bootcamp where I learned JS, vue.js, react.js, node.js, express, postman, MySQL and mocha.

Since I ended the Bootcamp, I built a website as a freelancer but I haven't been able to find a steady job in a company as a Frontend Developer. I have applied for 10 jobs a week and only two of them got me to the coding challenge phase (most of the applications just end up as rejection emails, saying they chose someone more experienced). In both cases, they said my coding challenge was not bad but they chose someone else, so the last 6 months of job search went nowhere.

Even for unpaid internship positions, they are choosing someone else and I really don't know what I am doing wrong. There is also extremely difficult to find junior roles to apply at the moment and I spend hours in LinkedIn finding something.

Does anyone have any tips about what I am doing wrong? I don't know what else I can do.

Any help will be much appreciated."

For reference, I'm a third year engineering undergraduate on a four year course. I've got high grades (76% average in second year) and have already done one summer research experience at my university which is highly ranked globally. I feel I have the academic credentials so far for applying for a PhD, but obviously want to maximise my chances of acceptance as much as possible.

Like many people, I cast a very wide net to apply to as many internships as I could. Fortunately, today I got back an offer for a relatively impressive company to do an electronics internship - it's not a Google or an Apple but it's a large company that most people have heard of. Sorry I'm being vague, I don't want the recruiter to see my name and read my doubts.

There is potential (but it's by no means guaranteed) that I could do a summer research internship at a university lab as opposed to working in industry for the summer. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I would be able to do any research work in a lab that's related to my (hopeful) PhD subject area. I could probably do something in electronics, but I really would like to work in quantum computing in the future.

My question is as follows: How much better/worse are industrial placements rather than university research internships when I'm applying for PhDs next year. Would one offer any advantages over the other?"

As I've done research though, it doesn't seem like now  is the best time to move anywhere internationally. Therefore, I am  interested in places to move in the continental US!

As  of now I am in the Denver metro area. My lease ends at the end of June.  I work in tech and will have about 6 months of experience along with  some internship experience for my company. I also did some data  analytics work and project management.

However, while I absolutely love Colorado and all it has to offer, I would love to experience living in another place in the US.

Some things I would prefer most are as follows:

\- A metro area that is as large or larger than Denver

\-  A place with good walkability. I.e. preferably not a sprawling  metropolis (albeit if a section of the city is walkable that is fine  too)

Some nice things to have, but not extremely necessary:

\- Nice weather. Basically not freezing cold most of the time (I'm looking at you, upstate New York)

\-  Diversity. I am Asian American, so would be nice to have. Truthfully  though any place with strong histories of diversity would be fine too.

\-  Natural amenities. I know that truthfully very few places match  Colorado's beauty, but beaches or mountains would be nice if possible.  Again not necessary but would be nice.

Some  of my hobbies are reading, walking (in nature or city), participating  in sports, and going to coffee shops/live entertainment. For me I am  okay living in a higher cost of living area if it makes sense. I  consider myself fairly intellectual and I like being around smart people  as well.

FYI my company is expanding to Chicago and Dallas, so those are possibilities.

Any  suggestions or ideas are appreciated! Most of the things I listed are  still more on the side of ""nice to have"", and I know there is no perfect  place. With that in mind, I am open to what the US has to offer."

I tried web development with Django for some times after that. Then I tried Machine Learning on Coursera. I almost took all of the courses there by Andrew. I am from somewhere where there is not much opportunity to get an internship as a student. I want to go abroad for higher studies. But to do that I need to get a job first. All the job opportunities in my country are mostly web dev-related. ML-related jobs require some advanced degrees. In these circumstances, it is a risk to get devoted to ML.

I was just sort of seeing what was out there. However, I recently went through a couple-month long interview process with a position as a tech support representative for a SaaS company in my area. Whilst this isn’t a SWE position, I thought it could be a great stepping stone towards getting some necessary experience while I go to school.

At this position I would
- use Salesforce to respond to client problems
- writing custom programs to provide tailored solutions for clients
- Trouble shoot problems related to our software, hardware and 3rd party integrations
- Analysis and troubleshooting for development escalation

So I'm a nontraditional student (29) at a top 25 school for cs in the us studying math and comp sci. I had a pretty rough go of it when I was younger. Without getting into specifics, I have the classic story of getting into drugs and getting a couple arrest with one being a felony drug possession charge and the other a petit theft charge. I was not convicted of either but I knew they still would showed up. Anyway, several years ago I got sober and decided to get on with my life. I went back to school and decided I kind of liked math and comp sci. I busted my butt at a community college to transfer into a top cs school (those redemption story essays also kind of help out a bit I think). This whole time I was under the impression that I was ineligible for expunction because I thought I was convicted of the theft charge. Turns out I wasn't. I reached out to a lawyer in that state and a lawyer in my current state for the possession charge. Long story short, they both have filed petitions for expungement. It'll be a couple months before they are completed but I also still have another 3 semesters at least before I graduate because of the added math major.

I know that companies might still discover arrests from private databases and that I'm not completely in the clear. I'd still like to try to get ahead of things as much as possible as soon as my petitions are completed. If I know of at least a couple background checking firms that bigger tech companies use, I can request my record when 2021 internship season starts rolling full force and I can dispute the records before they even come up for an employer. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if there is a list, that would be amazing. If not, any ideas for at least a couple companies? I'd like to know where to begin if at all possible. Also if anyone also has encouraging experience with a similar situation, I'd love to hear it."

I thought having a minor would help with internships and job search,  but it doesn't and my advisor agreed, too. I feel like I have sufficient programming skills for engineering career from taking 131 and 132.

I switched my major to CS after my first year of college, so I felt really behind when it came to applying to internships for summer after sophomore year. I also put off doing personal projects because I was busy working, and I thought people practicing LeetCode were being extra (I understand I was wrong now).

However, I live in an area where a lot of Big Tech companies are located, and I want to take advantage of that.

I'm seeking advice on how to continue in advancing my career in HR. 

Background:My junior year did school I did an internship for a local insurance company for 9 months and then another internship at our local YMCA for only 2 months (cut short because of covid). I then graduated in May 2020 with a Bachelors in Business Admin w/a psych minor. After a tough time job searching for the majority of 2020 (thanks to the plague) I finally landed a part time recruiting position at a local homecare place. I never really wanted to do Recruiting but I took what I could get so I could stop doing housekeeping and get into HR. I don't want to stay here as it's a kinda crappy environment, I didn't receive the full time I was promised, and honestly this style of recruiting is killing me slowly lol. I pretty much never stopped applying for new jobs but not much was popping up. So I've been here about 6 months.

The Now: Long story short I have had initial interviews for two positions at two seperate places and just received the call from the second one. I have landed second interviews for both! I'm shocked and amazed lol I have a few questions initially: 

1) What do they ask during a second interview? How does it differ from the initial one? I know I'll have different interveiwers for at least one of the positions. 

2) Do I tell them Im in the running for another position or just keep this to myself until after I get the offer? (I'm assuming keep it a secret is the correct answer) 

3) What do I do if I get both offers? I've never turned down an offer so I'm not sure how long I have to think about it. What if I get one offer but I want to wait and see if I get the other one? They've been fairly on the same page but a few days apart. 

So onto which job to choose: 
Both have the same compensation range but one may offer slightly high than the other. Would maybe away a decision but I have a feeling it's going to be like $1 difference. Both are hourly. 

[JOB A] HR Assistant 
At the headquarters of a labor type job. They don't actually do the labor thing in this state so none of the employees are local. They said it's between 150-200 employees. But the office is only 11 people, nice office seemingly nice coworkers. I would be doing a lot of everything, probably a decent amount of ""bitch work"" and admin stuff. I'm fine with this. Id have a generalist and a he director above me. I like the idea of having a localized HR team. I feel I would be mentored and learn a lot without being too hands on. This one feels lower risk.

[JOB B] HR Coordinator 
In store HR person at a large name outdoors retail store. My only HR team member would be who I report to and she would be remote, but she seemed super awesome in the interview. I would be support for managers, employee relations, recruiter, ect. I feel like being the only HR person would give me a bit of freedom, but also I'd have to figure a lot out on my own? I like the idea of getting my hands in lots of different HR pots because I seriously don't love being just a recruiter and with my psych background I really want to get into ER and Employee satisfaction and stuff like that. This position feels higher pressure but maybe higher reward. Definitely full time. 

I'm not sure if going from recruiting coordinator to HR assistant would look bad on my resume, I have been trying to be cautious of giving myself a demotion."
may3di,1,2021-03-22,Job gap while working on projects?,biggestheadd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/may3di/job_gap_while_working_on_projects/,"I graduated two years ago with a cs degree and very little work experience as well as no internships. After almost a year of job searching I landed an IT job in which I’ve been doing some application development with various technologies. 

I have been working at this company full time for a little over a year and I planned to continue learning and working on side projects but everything eventually caught up to me and I didn’t have motivation to work full time and come home to do more work. 

I am now at a point where I push through and work on personal projects after work or on weekends because I dislike this job that much. But I feel like it’s not a enough. 

I have some money saved up and the stimmy checks hit. So I’ve been wondering if I could quit and just work on projects and leetcode while applying to other jobs for like 4-6 months. 

Would a gap after my first tech job look bad on my resume? Should I just suck it up and continue working until I find another job?

Thoughts?"

I've never built anything in my own time, but I've been looking at summer internship opportunities (southern hemisphere, end of this year) and for the Software Development roles, a lot of them prefer people who make their own projects.

I'm just wondering if I should start building something as a result? I have other commitments outside of university, but just wondering if I can start a software development role without having previously built anything during my free time? I've had strong results in my assignments nonetheless..?"
mayrdl,8,2021-03-22,Cant get out of this hole I'm suck in.,bigstruggles2k21,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mayrdl/cant_get_out_of_this_hole_im_suck_in/,"Not really sure where else to turn at this point, I was diagnosed from a young age in elementary school, put on Ritalin, life went on for a few years. Going into high school I stopped the meds, didn't like how they made me feel. Always felt like a mindless zombie. 

Fast forward 10+ years, I finally admit that I am going to need some help. Cannot seem to get a grasp on online school. Back to Ritalin, still cannot stand it. Told the doc, ever since then its just been an onslaught of different dosing and medication. Adderall is ok, feel pretty good on it but still can't seem to get anything done. Doc just switched me to Vyvanse as of today, I guess we will see how that goes. 

I just cannot seem to function anymore, for background I am an extremely self motivated person, I work extremely hard all of the time. After high school I joined the military, for the sake of work this is a throw away account, but I saw more than my fair share of combat overseas and now going back to the normal American 9-5 is crushing me mentally. I am a Cyber Security major now and ever since the pandemic hit and school swapped to online I have been struggling. I sought out help with medication and that only seemed to help for a little while. Now I find myself sitting around, feeling great from the meds, but doing absolutely nothing. I sit at my desk and just daze off into nothing, I retain nothing from zoom meeting, and have lost all drive to move forward. I am in a hyper competitive internship and am absolutely crushing my competition, but I just want to stop. I don't care anymore, not sure what to do. I go to weekly therapy, I try and vent and talk to as many people as I can but at the end of the day I feel extremely alone, not even my wife has an understanding of what I feel and I have tried to explain it so many times. It even took me 2 hours of sitting here to write this post. I am so burnt out at this point, I have been lucky enough and worked hard enough to have these incredible opportunities but now it just feels like nothing matters. Not sure what to do, educated myself quite a bit on ADHD and all of the medications and talked extensively with my doctors and I just follow what they advise but it always feels terrible. Its all the same, first week of meds either feel amazing or make me want to fight the world. Then after I just go numb for weeks and fall even further behind with all of my work. Sorry for the long post, there is just way too much going on. Thanks."

I have gotten 2 interviews but both of those were from references but didn't get past the tech interview, I am pretty strong skills for a college student due to my lack of experience I didn't get it(output error message questions and perfect syntax GIT operations questions). 

How long will the job market be like this? I'm considering giving up looking for a job and starting my own company, I have some money saved up from all the summer jobs I worked and my Internship.

I will be working a summer internship with a Fortune 100 bank doing frontend work. I recently received an offer for a Fall term internship/co-op with a company that is not well known (climate control products). The Fall internship work would be a combination of embedded systems and backend work. However, the downside is that it is located in a remote area (not WFH). So, I'm requesting advice/thoughts on the impact or benefit that taking this second internship would have for resume and Fall recruiting. If this opportunity will give me a significant leg-up from other candidates during Fall recruiting, I'm definitely inclined to take the offer. But if the benefit is very low, I'll likely just use this time towards more leetcode and personal projects. I appreciate any input/advice!"

How much do you make?|I started out at 70k/yr with over 100k in debt. Now I'm five years out and just went up to 115k/yr and have 60k in debt. I can make a bonus at the end of the year based on the hospital production. I believe I make above average for my area but I work in a very affluent town at a very well run hospital.
oi mate, thanks for your ama, lots of great stuff answers here, keep fingers crossed for your career and kudos for helping our little fluffy brothers. few years ago i'd ask you lots of stuff concerning vet job but i've been with my pets through such hell that i can only say - i admire what you do, my respect to you sir. well apart from that, i wasn't goin to post anythin here but, hell, i'm actually a bit worried right now so and thing is kind of a fresh , i'll give it a shot - i have 2 wonderfull maine coon fluffs, both of them would say hi but apparently they prefer to stay dormant for most of the day life - so i'll say it for them - hi. one of them developed kind of a watery-eye thing over the last 24 hrs. there's no color of that fluid, did some quick research and seemslike it's pinkeye. question's here - is there chance it'll go by itself? i already started to think how to reschedule my monday to bring her to vet to check this out but even so, i was wondering, from your experience, how often that watery/crying eye thing appear and what that can mean? she's keeping her normal behavior so far, no issues noticed with that, just that bugging eye uhh. once again, great stuff, kudos|If she starts to wince with that eye or the discharge gets worse and turns thick yellow/green she should be seen. If its just watery and she is using the eye fine otherwise and not bothered by it you can probably monitor it over the weekend and call your vet on Monday just to see what they recommend. Some cats get mild viral flare-ups that cause eye discharge or just irritate their eye but sticking their face somewhere stupid and it can clear up on its own, but any signs of pain or infection (green/yellow color) should be checked.
Since you said you did do some work with farm animals in school: What's the worst species you ever dealt with and what breed of goat was it? (Source: had goats for a while, never again) Actual question: I live in the US south where there are many ticks though not much Lyme disease. I check my dog after every trail run but occasionally one gets through. Is there any harm to dogs if a tick attaches for a while like there can be for humans?|I'm from a tick heavy and Lyme heavy area. Pulling ticks off as soon as you notice them will reduce the risks of tickborne disease transmission. The longer the tick is attached the high risk of disease. I believe current research shows like disease transmission occurs around 16-20hrs if tick attachment so many tick preventatives are effective at killing ticks fast enough, but we honestly don't know enough about anaplasmosis, Rocky mountain spotted fever and other tick diseases to say. Some think anaplasmosis transmits as fast as 3-6hrs which is very fast so checking for ticks everytime you come in from a walk or hike is super important!
 |Also I actually love goats. They're assholes, but boy do they know it and play it up. I'm not a fan of llamas. They're assholes and willing to mess you up.
Hi I have a rescue cat (formerly feral but now very friendly) and she got recently diagnosed with dermatitis allergies(?) And got prescribed apoquel. I apply revolution plus on the back of the neck every month for the past 5-6months, but I think my vet still suspects fleas for some reason. Is it possible that she could still have fleas on her body even with flea meds? Have you ever seen indoor cats with fleas even after applying meds on the cat? Thanks!|Flea allergy dermatitis is extremely common in cats, and some cats need VERY aggressive flea prevention to manage it. I have some owners apply revolution every two weeks to start and see if this helps before going to once monthly. That being said if you're using Revolution Plus monthly this is one of the best products on the market for it. If you don't live in an area that is flea heavy (southern US) then you may need further work-up or want to consider consulting a dermatologist if the Apoquel isn't working. Apoquel will treat the symptom of itching/scratching from the allergy but it does not manage the underlying cause and primary immune response as well. It just helps very slightly with the inflammation. Your cat may need stronger medication or a multi-modal approach.
Cool AMA! Thank you for stepping up :) My question would be: how much training did your education provide on nutrition, specifically for cats? And was this education in any way shape or form influenced/sponsored/provided by pet food manufacturers? The reason i ask is because i only recently after an expensive surgery for struvite crystals learned how horribly inappropriate dry food/kibble is compared to the biological needs of a cat. They should eat meat and meat only, but we literally feed them 0% meat. Instead we give them cheap plant based stuff with just enough added essential amino acids for them not to (hopefully) die on the diet. There are plenty vets who warn against dry food, but still so many ""normal"" vets seem oblivious or comfortable recommending dry food/kibble- when there are no benefits yet so many dangerous downfalls. Dry kibble is literally like trying to modify old worn rubber-tires with just enough nutrition to sustain a human nutritionally... a pointless exercise yet we do it on our cats.|At Tufts we received two semesters of nutrition classes from boarded veterinary nutritionists and would also work with the nutritionists during clinics to come up with plans for both hospitalized patients and long them plans for cases being discharged. I've also focused most of my continuing education on cats and much of that involves cat nutrition. The only ""kickback"" I've ever received from any pet food company is a free pen/frisbee/useless piece of junk from their booth at a conference, and a 10-20% discount on their brand of food if I buy it for my own pets.
 |The reason we recommend a lot of big brand diets is because they have the most money to do solid research into their food. It's true cats are obligate carnivores and require a much higher protein diet than kibble can offer, however that does not mean there is no place in their diet for kibble. I typically recommend feeding a majority of canned food and supplement with kibble for dental health and personal ease. The reality is most owners can't or won't feed an ideal home cooked or balanced diets and most of these diets fail anyways according to research because if you don't do it right the cat (or dog) will only way what they want and not get a balanced amount of nutrients there need. I feed my own cats a mix of purina, fancy feast, science diet, and tiki brand items, must cans or purees with a bowl of kibble. I also encourage others to feed cats and dogs in a way that is more natural to them using food toys to make them work and ""hunt"" for their food.
 |I will also add that so much is changing constantly with our understanding of nutrition in all species. We definitely understand dogs more than cats because they are the easier species to do research on and for a long time were more profitable. Any blog or food company that slams any particular type of food for how bad it is, or acts like there have it all figured out is lying. It's an ever changing learning process and at least the bigger companies are constantly adjusting their diets based on up to date research rather than following marketing trends, this is why most vets still recommend kibble because it is easier for 95% of pet owners and the brands they recommend are still very reliable.
It’s crazy that I was going to find a good sub to ask this and I noticed your AMA, so thank you for taking the time to answer people’s questions. Are there any options for dental care/work on an older cat (18 in a couple months) with kidney issues(stage 3 at least)? We’ve been told in the past she would probably not survive the anesthesia but one of her canines looks a little rough when I looked recently. It used to just be a red line down the side but now it looks a little cavity and there are little like translucent white bubbles/balls around at the surface. So it may need to be removed. Is brushing her teeth a realistic/useful option, or would it just traumatize her?|I would consult a vet that is skilled with dentistry if you're vet if hesitant, you can even find boarded veterinary dentists. They typically have more skilled staff at managing anesthesia for higher risk patients and better equipment (like a head CT) to make they procedure faster.
When I took my cat to the vet a few time, she didn't display much fear &amp; jumped up onto the reception desk to say hello but other than that, she was a very normal domestic feline. Following her visits, the vet nurse would tell me Suki made an impression on the office. Is this something you tell all pet owners to make them feel special? Like, obviously I thought she was the best cat on the planet but that's because I raised her adorable ass.|Nah, if she was that cool then everyone gets excited. Basically any animal that isn't afraid of me and shows me any affection during their visit is a winner in my books and I will gush about it to the owner
A long time ago I saw an episode of Law and Order where the police show up to figure out what happened to an unconscious or deceased person (I can't remember which) and this man at the scene tells them a surprisingly specific diagnosis for what likely was wrong with them, like what bones were broken, and after seeing the look of complete surprise and confusion on everyone's face, he explains that he is a veterinarian so he is used to figuring out what's wrong with a patient who is unable to communicate. I have always wondered if vets really have this skill and if it would really translate to diagnosing humans?|We're not magicians. A huge percentage of my ability to determine an issue comes down to the history for the appointment. Half of the time I have a damned good idea of what's going on before I even lay hands on an animal, though there are times I find something major on exam that changes my initial list of differentials. However, it is not helpful to send your pet with someone who cannot give any information about what is going on at home. Often I have care takers or nannies bring pets in for the owner and they can't tell me anything about why they're there or the routine husbandry of the pet and this often is detrimental to determining the issue. There is still some level of.. detective work involved and knowing what questions to ask and what to check on exam that may translate to human medicine. I think veterinary work is most similar to pediatrics
I have several questions. If a student wants to become a bird vet or a farm vet or whatnot, how much harder is it to get the schooling? Does Large Animal also cover things like whales and giraffes? Or is that more Exotic Animal territory? How broad or narrow are the specializations? Do monkey doctors have to do exotic animal training, or is it a mix of normal doctor and vet training? I imagine between the similar genetics and poo throwing, it would be a lot like working in a care home, except that an orangutan can rip your arms off if it feels like it.|Depends on the vet school. Technically tufts trained us on everything, though I didn't feel comfortable seeing certain species with more specific training and mentorship. I actually worked with monkeys some in research during my training, so beyond that there is no more specific training. You so need to be way more cautious with proper PPE for to the higher risk of zoonotic diseases though.
 |Large animal medicine only refers to farms animals really. Zoo animals fall under exotics but that way we learn medicine is in a comparative fashion, so if you know horses you could probably manage a zebra and if you know llamas and alpacas then you could manage a camel etc.
 |With my license I could see any species I choose upon graduation, it just comes down to how comfortable you actually are seeing and treating those species. If interested in birds it helps to work at a practice that has other doctors that also see birds to help with mentorship after school.
How do you accomplish your work with such tiny little paws?|With very messy handwriting
My mom has a cat that's been messing in the house for years and can't seem to stop. She isn't super old and she doesn't have a bladder infection. My mom always cleans it and has tried various products. Daisy isn't afraid of the dogs at all either. Why would she be messing in the house? Even when my mom had litter trays out she would still do it.|There are a lot of stressors in indoor cats that we aren't great at identifying and can cause bad urinary habits. I would check out The Indoor Cat Initiative by The Ohio State on types of stressors for indoor cats and troubleshooting bad urinary habits. I would also be sure you've talked to your vet about possible causes and if its behavioral consider anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication. Prior to medicating though be sure the litterbox is in a non-threatening area of the house that has more than one way to enter/exit as cats do not like to use a litterbox if they feel like they can be cornered in their by other animals.
My moms two new puppies have Parvo. Do you have any advice that is new or often overlooked? She has all the medication, IV, and pedialyte and is caring for them at home. I'm about to have puppies any day and I am terrified of tracking it into my newborn pups. Should I avoid my moms house until my pups are at their forever homes?|Definitely keep your new pups away from your mom's house if she has parvo puppies there. We typically keep them in isolation at the hospital and have strict cleaning protocols for after they leave. You should talk to your own vet for your pups about their vaccine status and how to clean your mom's house once the pups are gone.
[deleted]|Sounds like she either had a serious infection when young that damaged get nasal turbinates and sinuses or possibly a mass or severe dental issue that could cause the same thing. Only way to know would be a ct scan of her sinuses and teeth and if the damage is bad there isn't much more to be done than what you were already doing other than maybe aggressive surgery. Sorry to hear about the struggles your sweet bun went through!
Fun AMA! I have loved all my vets throughout my life. I rescued a 12yo cat from the shelter last year, and he throws up like all the time. It used to be daily when I was feeding him tiki cat wet food but the vet said to switch to a bigger brand so I got hill’s wet food but he still throws up probably once a week+. I’ve taken him to two vets who said they saw no problem with this. Should I keep asking? I don’t have a lot of expendable income for monthly vet appointments to be told everything is fine, but it can’t be good for him to throw up like that?? I feel so bad :[|Have you tried a diet for sensitive stomachs? Some cats just vomit a lot, but if its not hairball related then I worry about dental disease, sensitive stomachs, food allergies, GERD etc. If he's not losing weight and still eating well its unlikely a major issue if you're limited financially, but I would consider continuing to try a different diet. Some cats need limited ingredient protein based diets (Purina has a sensitive skin and stomach that is salmon and rice based), or need high fiber diets. Hill's Science Diet GI Biome works great for GERD and colitis. Beyond diet changes though GI issues can be expensive to work up and get to a diagnosis.
Why might cause a cat to chronically lose their voice a bit? Like go hoarse.|This depends on their age, breed, and how often it happens. Some cats vocalize more with age and attention which can cause a hoarse voice. Sometimes it's just change in vocal cords and use as they get older, but other cats can have vocal changes from hyperthyroidism as the thyroid gland sits up against the larynx. Other cats have chronic upper airway disease that can cause some changes around the sinuses and after the voice. Finally some cats just learn to change the sound of their meow based on what you respond more too.
Do they put crack in Dreamies/Temptations? I have never seen a single cat that doesn't go mad for them. What exactly is it about them that cats love? Also my cat is becoming increasingly immune to flea treatments. What happens if they all stop working?|My reply to this somehow ended up as it's own comment but yes, I suspect they lace temptations with crack. Cats are drug addicts after all
Greetings! Thanks for doing this. I have an almost 15 year old female diabetic cat who was diagnosed with (squamous, I think) cancer of the mouth/jaw sometime between Christmas and New Years. I first noticed something was wrong because her profile (her jaw on one side) seemed off, and within a week or 2 it was noticeably misshapen and then after the bloody drool started one weekend, I took her in that Monday afternoon and was told it was cancer. From what I was told and researched a bit, I understand there isn't much to be done. And in her case, the vets (who I love dearly, they're great, and they just love my sweet old kitty) mentioned that likely the only thing that could be done likely would be really invasive and probably involve removing a good part of her jaw. So, no thanks on that. I am a big proponent of not keeping suffering pets alive longer than they should be. I hate the idea of her suffering or being in pain, and it kills me that she cant tell me when that point is. For now shes eating fairly well still, although we've switched her onto really soupy/gravy soft wet food. (Which she loves, apparently.) She still gets her insulin shots 2x daily. She's had a pretty much steady stream of blood clots from her mouth and non-bloody and bloody drool. I have old blankets on my bed and the pillows/chair she likes, and I'm just kind of watching her go through it at this point. What would you say would be the best indication that she is either in a lot of pain and/or the time is near? My vet mentioned to watch for once she stops being able to eat, which I can understand. I'm mostly stuck at home thanks to covid so I'm around her quite a bit. I love her dearly and just don't want her to suffer or be in pain longer than she needs to be.|So in these scenarios I'm usually very honest with people that if nothing can be done and we know it's going to progress then there is no ""too soon"". As soon as you think she is ready, even if she is still eating, then it's time. Many animals will eat through pain so I would talk to your vet about palliative pain management. I would also just plan that as soon as she has any bad days, isn't as affectionate as she normally is, doesn't perk up with her favorite treat or activity, doesn't go to get favorite perch etc then it's time. Especially being a diabetic I'd be worried how the stress of cancer will complicate the diabetes control and make her susceptible to secondary infections. I'm addition to pain management I would consider long term antibiotic therapy though some vets would disagree with this approach.
Hi! I have a 9 year old rescue cat who we got in July last year. He's an indoor cat and neutered. He had a dental in August with 5 extractions - the first symptoms of his dental disease were constant sneezing, going off his food, runny nose, runny eyes and pawing at his face. He's been fine since his dental. Vaccination status somewhat unknown (he was given to the rescue after his owner died suddenly. The daughter of the owner gave him in, said she knew her mum had had him vaccinated but didn't know when and couldn't find his book in the house. As a result vets told us to wait 6 months to vaccinate him after getting him). Over the last two days we've noticed he's sneezing more. Nothing like when he had dental disease, but enough to notice its an increase. Maybe 5-6 times a day, never more than once at a time. He sometimes sounds a bit snuffly, especially when he's playing or grooming, but has done for as long as we've had him, pre and post dental. He does snore quite a bit too, sometimes it sounds a bit like he's snoring softly when he's awake. Other than that and the sneezing he has no other symptoms - no runny eyes or nose, still eats like a pig, is drinking fine, using the litterbox as normal, doesn't paw at his face unless he's grooming it, he's totally fine for you to touch his face or mouth and he's still playing like he normally does. He is possibly shaking his head a little more, but tbh that might just be me noticing it more cause its not something you exactly notice unless you're looking for symptoms. We haven't changed litter brands or anything else in the house beyond a different brand of washing up liquid that isn't used on his stuff anyway. I only thought about that today so will stop using it in case. One of the days I noticed the sneezing I did have a candle burning, but it was upstairs in a room he's not allowed in with the door shut. Since then I've got rid of the candle and still sneezing. We've not done a big clean or anything like that either. There doesn't seem to be a pattern to his sneezing. We actually have a vet appt booked for Monday for his vaccs but obviously we will be asking about the sneezing. I'm not overly concerned because he does seem totally fine otherwise, but a little nervous because last time he went from a little sneezy to refusing to eat due to dental pain in like a day. So I was just wondering if you had any insight in the meantime?|Sneezing can also be a sign of stress. Definitely talk to your vet about it on Monday
When I was younger in the ‘80s we used to take our pets in for shots and the like. We’d walk out with all the required vaccinations and an exam for $25. Why can’t I do the same today? Why is it $190 out the door now? Add more if things like Lyme or heartworm vaccinations - now we’re approaching $300.|Inflation, cost of living, cost of education, and cost of medicine has all gone up. Also the technology behind vaccines and testing is significantly more advanced today then just even ten years ago. Think about the cost of college when you were little and the cost today. Think about the cost of a house just 5 years ago compared to today. We need to make enough to pay the bills, pay our staff, pay the lab and overhead, and support a house and family on top of paying student debt.
Hi there! My staffy X has just been diagnosed with pannus. She's been given the steroidal drops but they said it was 'significant' and if it doesn't improve within a week, we will have to go to an eye specialist. If you've had any experience with pannus, is it at all reversible? Thank you!|Most often it is a lifelong condition and there are a few different underlying causes from neurologic disease to autoimmune. If you're vet is recommending an ophthalmologist then I would definitely consider that second opinion since they know the most up to date medications and research for these issues. My pug has KCS and has done well with both cyclosporine and tacrolimus drops, but his is autoimmune, not neurologic.
I have two adorable lop eared buns but they refuse refuse refuse to eat any of the hay. I've tried so many types.. They nibble new stuff to try it but usually dismiss it after that. Any fresh greens including romaine gives them bad runs. Why are my buns so wierd? They eat pellets mostly only. I want to give them treats too but the poops aren't worth it. The male gets really bad poopy bum as a result|some buns are just super stubborn. I usually try to limit pellet intake by measuring a strict amount per day to try and force them to eat more hay and would encourage as much exercise as possible which can get them to digest food better and eat better.
Hello! My SO is in their 2nd year of Vet School studying to be a small animal vet. What are some things I can do to support them/what were some of the things that helped you get through the tougher days?|Helping them remember there is life being vet school. Offering distractions when they're needed, but also understanding the amount of time, work, and studying that is needed and allowing them to focus and grind when they need to. Best of luck to you both! The other important thing is to remember vet school isn't forever. No matter how hard it gets, it does end!
How much do you know about stray and feral cats? There is a raggedy old cat that has been around for a few years, at least. It's begun hanging around my doorways more lately and so I rigged it a little shelter as the days get shorter and colder. Wounds and scabs on the face like it's been in fights, or picked on. I give warm food and water each morning. I think it is nearly deaf as well. The kitty lets me pet it, and likes the contact, not feral, used to associating with the neighbor lady who has given it food for a while also. I already have a 1.75-year old indoor kitty. What are the risks associated with adopting this other cat? Is it likely to have coronavirus and/or leukemia? How much is the usual cost to test for all this stuff if I take it in to the vet? I understand the complexity of the social dynamic; I am more interested in the medical dangers.|I'd be very worried about the possibility of feline leukemia virus if it's an outdoor stray that looks like it gets into flights with other cats. I would keep them completely separate until you got the stray tested for FIV/FeLV as well as fever parasite testing. Costs vary wildly based on location and individual practice so I can't quite comment on that. Our practice would charge $70 for exam, $60 for FIV/FeLV and $55 for fecal testing. If there is any other bloodwork they recommend if it's an older cat then it may be more, but this would be basic recommendations before introducing to another household pet in addition to vaccinations.
What are your thoughts about e cuniculi? I had one half of a bonded pair of rabbits pass away from it after owning her two years. The bunny was a rescue who spent a few months outdoors after being dumped by a former owner. I'm assuming that's how she was originally infected, although I do wonder if she could have caught it at bunny hoppy hour. All the local rescues get real cagey or straight up say they won't adopt to us because e cuniculi has been in the house and my original rabbit was exposed to it. What exactly IS e cuniculi? Can a rabbit be exposed and then suddenly show symptoms months or years later? Have most rabbits actually been exposed and it's not a big deal? The rescue rabbit died two years ago and my original bunny who is still here has never shown any symptoms of any kind. Are rescues being unreasonable in refusing to adopt a new bunny mate for him? Thank you so much for answering my questions.|It's a parasitic infection that we see in annoying frequency in rabbits and can cause chronic recurring infections and symptoms. You can always have your current rabbit tested to see if they're a carrier, but many rescues have frustratingly strict policies not always guided by science so even with a negative test they may still refuse to adopt to you. It's often spread by wild rabbits so outdoor buns are at higher risk but I've also seen it go through shelter and rescue populations. Sorry that is something you're dealing with!
Not sure if this has already been asked, but what drew you to veterinary medicine?|I always really liked science and medicine so I knew I wanted to do something in the medical field and I have loved animals my whole life and grew up withb all kinds of pets and creatures. Everyone was telling me I'd make a good veterinarian from when I was little. I never really thought it would happen though until I really pushed myself in college to get the experience and make it happen.
I adopted my cat after his previous owner left him behind when they moved. I was told by the first vet I took him to that he likely had a kitten cold that never fully went away. As a result, he has upper respiratory issues- congestion, sneezing, and snot rockets. The issue we’re having is he’s becoming increasingly more difficult to medicate the older he gets/the more often he has flare ups. We’re normally prescribed doxycycline but the liquid form makes him throw up immediately and he eats around the pills no matter what we do. I was wondering what you would prescribe/recommend in these types of situations and if there’s any alternative treatments? Thank you for your time!|These are right because many cats can have chronic respiratory issues from viruses when they were young. Doxycycline or amoxicillin-clav are the best antibiotics to cover flare ups, doxy has some anti inflammatory effects which is helpful and covers for mycoplasma. However if difficult to medicate there may be injectable antibiotics to try, you can try lysine treats, and I've also seen injectable Cerenia diluted and used as nasal drops to help. I would talk to your vet about alternative options or long term management. You may even want to look into alternative therapies like cold laser though I'm not sure how many have tried it in these cases
I'm an aspiring veterinarian. Any advice on getting a good start in the field while I complete my schooling? My schooling has been on hold due to covid but I want to have a game plan going forward.|As much experience while you can! And taking on as much of a course load as you can to prove you can handle the rigor of vet school. But really just be sure it's what you want to do first. Best way is to work at a hospital.
Not sure if you’re still taking questions, just saw this post. First, thank you for what you do. I’ve worked in rescue and have been in the office (pre-COVID) to see what you, the techs and staff have to manage sometimes. So many ups and downs in your profession. Onto my question. What has been one of your most successful cases? Whether difficult to diagnose and finally found out what was going on, poor prognosis and the animal pulled proved everyone wrong. One of the ones that you think back on and smile. :)|Hi and thank you! I'm trying to still answer but running out of steam with how many questions are coming in! Didn't expect it to take off so much!
 |As for your question the best cases are the ones that prove us wrong when we give a poor diagnosis. Over a year ago I saw a lab that was coughing and breathing heavy. His chest was full of blood. We drained what we could and got him on an herbal supplement to help with bleeding. We diagnosed a lung mass and suspect a malignant and aggressive cancer. Didn't think he has more than a few weeks. To this day he is doing great! Still has the mass but it seems stable and not obviously spreading or growing in size.
My dog recently had surgery done on an ear hematoma, all good healing nicely. However my dad thinks he's embarrassed, because he has a huge cone and looks pretty dumb. Is the dog embarrassed, or just uncomfortable from the cone/healing ear?|Just uncomfortable and confused. They don't have the same types of emotions and awareness that would lead to embarrassment like we do.
My daughter is a HS Freshman with a strong interest in science and animals. She is leaning toward veterinary medicine, but also considering mortuary science. What do you recommend education and hobby-wise over the next 4 years to prep her if she continues on the veterinary medicine track? What did you look for in an undergrad? How did you choose Tufts over other schools?|I just picked a liberal arts undergrad that had a strong premed program. Honestly the cheaper the undergrad the better. The biggest factor in my decision was that I got a full scholarship since vet school or medical school is already very expensive. Each vet school had many required pre-req classes and they all vary so she should look into any vet schools she may consider and see what they require and be sure to go to an undergrad that offers those courses so she doesn't need to enroll elsewhere for a summer or semester. And start with any job experience early. The more hours the better and the more varied experienced the better. Definitely ask around small animal hospital about assistant jobs, check farms and 4H stuff, and some zoos and museums offer internships.
Why are vets generally not vegan? It's a little like MDs eating their patients or using them as clothing..|I don't think that's a very fair comparison. A large part of training with vet med includes agriculture and farm animals. We are also involved in food inspection and safety services. We know what is involved in raising and slaughtering animals for food or clothing. A lot of my classmates were vegetarian or vegan, but plenty came from 4H backgrounds and support farming. Veterinarians as a profession first started with farming and agriculture well before people owned companion animals. I honestly felt better about eating meat once I better understood good farming practices and supporting local farms. I think if you want to reduce your carbon footprint that is a fine reason to be vegetarian/vegan, but if you want to do it because of animal welfare you should learn more about farming practices first and perhaps choose to support the right farms and sources instead.
[deleted]|And what exactly is your experience? The difference between an internship trained vet and not is one year extra in a referral hospital after school, mostly seeing emergencies and specialized internal medicine cases. Internships give vets an extra year to gain confidence as a doctor before entering the real world, and more specialized experience if going into a residency. Internships do not give you substantial general practice experience and so not significantly change your skill as a vet. I have colleagues and friends that did an internship before working, plenty that did not, and several that went on to specialize. We are all excellently trained vets and good at what we do. Most of our skill comes down to how we've kept up with our training since school. A huge percentage of what I learned just give years ago is already outdated in medicine.
I read that 1 in 2 dogs will die of cancer. I’ve also read that hemangiosarcoma is particularly common in medium/ large dog breeds. Anecdotally, I have known many people including myself who have lost their dogs to it. Do you have any speculation as to why this could be? Could it be related to kibble/ processed meat protein?|Most likely genetics. We see it the most in purebred dogs, particularly golden retrievers. Goldens in the US have a heartbreakingly small gene pool due to lots of inbreeding. More responsible breeders are making an active effort to use studs from other countries to try and correct this.
Have you ever seen an animal who has consumed cannabis from an edibal? I've seen reports of how dogs have found their owner's edible stash and have eaten them before.|Plenty. Favorite case was a guy that had a bowl of chocolate edibles he put it for a party and then went to shower. Came back and his sweet pity had eaten the entire bowl. He rushed her to the er while I was in school before marijuana was legalized in MA. He was so brutally honest about what happened it was refreshing. We induce vomiting and the entire ER smelled like we hot boxed it and burnt chocolate.
I've always wondered. How do you go to work every day knowing your clients are afraid of you or even worse, totally willing to bite you? I thought about being a vet until I got a bird of my own and she totally hates the vet.|We try to make it as positive experience as possible. We offer lots of treats and praise, give sedatives beforehand if needed to help calm animals down, and also just hold them in ways that are the least stressful. Some days it's frustrating if everything is trying to eat me but it's definitely not every patient.
Weird question, I know, but would it be impossible to get a vets office to board a tarantula and how do I get them to not laugh at me when I call?|Depends on the vet honestly. Most would likely say no. Few vets offer boarding without a medical reason and then even fewer offer it to exotic pets. I would first look for vets that even offer services to tarantulas. Some may require an exam first to establish vet-client-patient relationship first before accepting a boarding patient.
Unlike some people I've never regretted a cent I've spent at my vets. Do you get those people often who feel just because you handle 'animals"" you don't have the same years in college and Uni studying and about the same costs to do so?|All if the time. Many people don't consider us real doctors even though we go through college and medical school the same as physicians. I'm just glad my own physicians appreciate my knowledge and talk to me like a medical professional.
If you could be any animal what would you be and why?|Cat, they literally get to sleep around in the sun all day.
Have you had much exposure to treating cats with FIP?|Only a little. I know of the treatments and followed some cases in the FIP warriors group on fb, but the drugs are not approved for use in the US yet so it's up to owners to do their own research and ordering. I cannot prescribe then as a vet.
What is your ideal diet recommendation for a Pug? Is your Pug cheeky?|My pug gets a prescription diet for urinary stones and weight loss. Any diet that will keep your pug at a healthy weight is key. Before he needed an Rx diet he was on Science diet sensitive skin and stomach for his allergies.
 |And yes my pug is cheeky, and very very spoiled by my parents. He's basically the prince and star of the family.
My vet’s office seems frazzled. Would it be weird to drop off a valentine’s gift box with a thank you note?|Gifts are always so appreciated!! Honestly some days are so busy I don't have time for lunch or a proper meal and I just eat chocolates and gifts from clients
Do you think it’s weird that a lot of veterinarians eat their patients?|Nope, for a more detailed response I replied to a similar question about vegans in vet med. For a brutally honest answer, I had some very long exhausting days working farms in vet school, dealing with asshole bulls and cows, and all I craved after was a juicy burger.. Also the formaldehyde smell in anatomy lab makes most people hungry. When you're thinking about lunch while dissecting the intestines of a horse nothing else can really bother you.."

mb0agv,58,2021-03-22,"My experience here at UMD - Some stories, a warning to incoming students with mental health issues or disabilities, and anyone interested in the school of education.",maerteen,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/mb0agv/my_experience_here_at_umd_some_stories_a_warning/,"I hate it here. I really do. I'm seriously considering transferring out of here because this school clearly seems to give zero fucks about their students, especially struggling ones. The only thing that's really keeping me here is the school's location and I wouldn't even know where else would be better. I'm a currently a junior as a history major, but not too long ago I was a secondary history education major before I decided that I was going to try to get my teacher's certification through avenues that aren't UMD's undergrad program. I'm currently living on campus at Commons, which I also don't recommend living in if you aren't going to make use of the kitchen.

The short version? **If you got a lot of long term mental health issues and disabilities that are going to make schoolwork or affording living difficult, I really recommend that you go consider another smaller school before committing to UMD.** This school has consistently failed to bring me any sort of needed assistance and the big lecture halls that you'll face early on are usually very unfriendly towards learning disabilities, especially since so many professors seem to think that everyone can absorb everything live purely by ear.

I've been struggling with ADHD and Bipolar II disorder for most of my life, finally getting those things properly diagnosed after seeking help through the school's behavioral health clinic + counseling building. Even while getting treatment, the negative effects of these things really started to hit hard after my first semester in Freshman Connection and has made getting through university schooling on a consistent basis very difficult. Pandemic era online schooling has only made this even worse. General executive functioning issues from ADHD that make starting basic tasks hard combined with being thrown into depressive weeks from Bipolar is a fucked combination for getting through university.

**ADS's Failure**

So why not get accommodations? Because ADS and to some degree Shoemaker has failed me pretty consistently and frankly at this point, the only faculty here that I really trust is my therapist over at behavioral health. Getting tested for ADHD is normally a very expensive process, but my psychiatrist and therapist have both told me that the Shoemaker building offers a relatively affordable screening. When I eventually got around to it and asked the front of the Shoemaker building about it, the lady working there claimed to know nothing about it, and the front desk of ADS downstairs just confusedly handed me an accommodations sheet and to go back upstairs to ask again. This set me back until my next therapy appointment, to where I'd finally get screened weeks later, then diagnosed a few months later into the next semester.

That's not even where it ends with ADS though. The first semester I officially started to use ADS accommodations was me going for note-taker accommodations so I could keep up in my lecture hall classes. There's little quality control for what the volunteering note-takers put out, so it just ended up that the notes I did have weren't very different from what I got on the ADS portal, sometimes even lower quality. If you use this and get a good note-taker or have a tendency to miss lectures, then this is probably fine. If you don't? Good fucking luck. Since the quarantine era started last year, those same accommodations got a little bit more redundant since recorded lectures at least gives me the space to get down everything I missed the first time around. This isn't something that I see changing, since there isn't much ADS can even do about the quality of the note-takers,

The next semester (the first of my junior year), I decided to apply to change my accommodations to extension accommodations, since that'd be much more helpful in an online environment and in general after the note-takers didn't come through as I had hoped. This was a.. disaster. History coursework can get quite reading and lecture heavy, especially with the classes I took last semester that demanded a lot of reading/lectures combined with discussion posts due every week. I still had to discuss what exact assignments could get extended with each of my professors as per ADS policy, and more appointments to set and do can already be a rough process for ADHD students as is.

Regardless, I managed to get to it. One professor out of three was very accommodating, didn't make me schedule a zoom appointment, and I probably didn't even need formal ADS permission for that one. The other two? They absolutely refused to accommodate the weekly discussion posts that were causing me so much grief, only willing to give extra time on larger assignments when I let them know in advance. At this point in the semester, I was already clearly overworked and extremely stressed out from actually doing their content instead of just skipping or halfassing a bunch of readings like I probably should have. The only thing they let me have was getting content a few days ahead of time, but this was basically useless when I was already being overworked and had to work myself even harder just to even get to a point where I'd be able to consistently make use of that extra time. I ended up dropping one of those classes, and the other I managed to get through with a B. Even when I tried to ask for some extra time from these two professors on other occasions, I've gotten inconsiderate and borderline hostile responses back from them.

I tried to contact ADS about this mess during the semester, explaining how those professors weren't even giving me any ground on anything that I actually needed. All I got was to schedule more phone appointments with ADS while I have no reception at all in my apartment at Commons. I kept forgetting to show up to every one of them (no reception in my apartment doesn't help either) and nothing else got to come out of it. I even got my therapist (who isn't attached to ADS) to send a letter of support to these professors, to which she never got a response from them.

In case you're wondering, their names are Katarina Keane and David Sartorious. Sartorious seems to have a pretty bad reputation overall, and he's also made other dick moves on the entire class with hiding grades when there's a big assignment around the corner while having very high workloads. Definitely avoid him. Keane is probably a pretty great professor if you don't have any issues like mine, but if you do, I'd also avoid taking a class from her if you can help it because of how inflexible she's been.

I tried to report this to the history dean and advising. I didn't hear back at all from a week or two until I forwarded it to the department head, who responded fairly quickly by saying he forwarded the issue to ADS. ADS took another 10 days to respond and finally let me set an appointment to discuss things further. During that meeting with the head of ADS a few weeks ago, I had to explain everything from scratch because gmail supposedly butchered the email screenshots from those professors that I sent and I'm not even sure they even read my email in full prior to the meeting. They said that they were going to get those professor's side of the story and contact me again later.

They still haven't contacted me again about it since. It's not like I'm getting any form of compensation anyway and I'm not even sure if those two are going to be getting any sort of accountability. The whole process of trying to get these extension accommodations are already pretty unfriendly to the disabled (but perfectly doable!) as is and it seems like they're going to side with professors before disabled students much of the time anyway. If this is the case, then extension accommodations from ADS are practically redundant if it won't get me past an inflexible professor.

**School of Education Stuff**

To get into the UMD School of Education's professional program for a certification + internship during your undergrad years, you need to apply and meet a number of requirements. From what I've learned about Towson and UMBC's programs, you're probably not getting rejected unless you're missing some basic credit or GPA requirements. UMD's on the other hand, is much more selective and also demands a lot of prior experience working with the age group you intend to work with(?) and a letter of recommendation specifically from a past employer and a faculty of the subject department you intend to teach to even have chance. My application got rejected, and while I do have one more shot, I got no desire to try again now.

Finding experience for me before the pandemic has sucked. I've tried contacting a few schools to never hear back from them but I eventually manged to get a stint as an eSports coach to help get that experience that helped a lot with getting experiences working with small groups and curriculum/lesson planning. I'm also a tournament organizer, so I've also got a good amount of experience around managing larger groups and event planning. Not exactly academic experiences, but helpful things that I was told definitely did count towards my experience requirement, but I think the only thing the applications people pulled out of it (despite explaining in my resume) was that I know how to use a computer. I also remember being told in TLPL470 that the class was normally supposed to help fill in the experience requirement for people trying to apply, but obviously the experiences I'd have been able to get from it were limited due to the pandemic.

For any incoming education majors, I recommend looking into TEAMS as soon as you can, as I've heard about them a bit too late myself. They supposedly help you get the needed experience for the app.

I scheduled an appointment with the applications people afterwards to get an explain as to why exactly I was lacking in experience, especially since they also directly told me that they were going easy on the experience requirement this time around because of the pandemic. Clearly they didn't lower it by much, if at all, but they claimed that I needed a wider breadth of experiences with larger groups like being a tour guide, coach for a sports team, or substitute teaching. They even told me that substitute teaching was an easy job to get right now because of the pandemic, with then me unsuccessfully finding any substituting or TA positions that I could qualify for after looking 3 nearby school districts. What a bunch of liars.

My letter of recommendation requirement also got fucked. I had a meeting with the accommodating professor to discuss it and she said that she was going to get it in by the end of December. Instead of doing that, she completely disappeared from contact for all of winter break then finally submitted it a few days into the next semester after I had already been rejected. I had a backup letter written, but it was from a non history professor so it didn't get to count. I could've even had another backup letter on top of that from someone in the education department, but it's still not a history professor so it wouldn't have helped anyway.

One of the big things those ladies also told me was that there were other ways or schools to get my certification at. It's true, I'm planning on doing some non university attached program instead. But, thinking about it now, the fact that it was such a prominent point of talk out of them was feels like them telling me to fuck off and that there's no place for students with disabilities in their program.

The next middle-finger out of them was the school of ed was when I later showed up to a feedback zoom meeting with some student ambassadors. I explained my situation to them, only to get a basic ""thanks for being so vulnerable"" as the all female and mostly white meeting continued to talk about implementing more diversity while I was the only male (I'm also Asian American) in there. Based on what others have been saying about their pandemic era school of education experience, I'm also inclined to think that they're selective not because it's a particularly strong program, but because they don't seem to have their shit together enough to accept more people.

There, I also asked about whether or not there was even any form of financial aid to come out a full time unpaid internship (while supposedly still taking subject area classes) to help cover living costs. All what there is to that ""look for more scholarships and loans I guess"" when the only scholarships I actually qualified for are ones where I have to write an essay to have a chance at getting 1000 a year later. The school of ed supposedly gives additional scholarships if you directly email them to apply for it, but there's very little information on it on their website. Apparently most university run programs don't give any additional financial aid while making you run a part time then full time unpaid internship. If you're not trying to fall into the private loan blender to afford living costs, you might want to look into other methods of getting a certification or make sure you have a steady job to save up money and get the extra financial aid that comes from being an independent.

I don't really trust my luck to not potentially get unlucky finding a job soon while private loan interest racks up and my family is in the cursed mid income range where they live in an expensive area and can't easily pay off college bills, but is too high income for me to go for any scholarships for lower income students. So, It's not like the school of ed was for me even if I ignored the fact they don't seem to want a guy like me regardless of how qualified I was.

If you're a secondary education major, also prepare for some confusing times with your advisors. You're required to double major education and the subject you want to do, yet advising there still expects you to also go see a separate advisor from your other major's department and act as sort of a middleman between the two. Email replies from advising have also been generally slow in my experience and often just boils down to ""let's have a meeting"" or ""go see your other advisor"" instead of answering the question.

**Commons**

Commons was going to charge people for rent even if they chose not to move in even despite a pandemic, so I decided to move in so I wouldn't be throwing money at nothing. I hate being at home long term anyway, making it the better move for my mental health regardless.

Already while moving in, things clearly weren't cleaned thoroughly or recently as everything in my room was pretty dusty despite extra precautions supposedly being taken. My washing machine + dryer doesn't work properly, with the washing machine forcing me to run extra spin cycles to wring out the excessive amounts of water it soaks into my clothes and the dryer sometimes needing extended 2+ hour long cycles to even adequately dry my clothes without making them smell moldy. We've called in 3-4 different work orders to get something done about it to no avail.

The heating in my room doesn't work properly, as all the air gets cool by the time it reaches my room. To even get heat in my 2 window room, I have to turn it all the way up to 78+ and close off the vents in the living room and kitchen, which bakes the rest of the apartment. I've yet to call in a second work order for this (the first one just taught me what I just mentioned), as I wasn't able to get around to it and the weather's been warming up.

For the first semester, the wireless internet was also atrocious due to a lack of access points and everyone's stuff connecting to the wrong access point even then. A guy from IT helped make things more usable at least, and eventually a all of commons got an internet upgrade very recently. My wired internet here has always been fine and it got even better with the upgrade. The wifi supposedly got faster, but I've been having it randomly cut out for a bit as much as before after that happened but it's pretty fine otherwise.

There's also literally no phone reception at least on my floor. People under Verizon and AT&amp;T need to go downstairs to the lobby to make or receive any phone call, text, or voicemail unless they get lucky and get a bit of reception for a bit. Any job/internship opportunity that has to call me back instead of emailing me back is almost dead on sight as a result.

So uh, my utilities are barely working as they should despite work orders and they're still charging me full price for rent. Isn't that a robbery and a half? I tried asking for at least a partial refund from rent because of this, but obviously that didn't work.

With the pandemic going on, there has also been a concerning amount of larger gatherings and parties around here, with seemingly little being done about it. I've reported the room above me for having parties 2-3 different times by now, yet they're either still on their shit or migrated to partying in another room out of my room's earshot.

Honestly, Commons for me has been ovepriced as hell for what I'm getting. 957 a month is a lot unless you got a steady job, especially when a bunch of my utilities aren't even working properly. Being able to cook my own meals and having more space to have friends over when it's safe to do so are the main benefits over dorms. If you don't care about either of these things, then do your funds a favor and keep staying in dorms.

**Overall**

I did make a lot of friends here at least, and the academics are still solid. The rest of this sub already makes clear that this is a big university whose main goal is to get your money, so don't go in expecting most faculty to give a damn about your well being. Trying to advocate for myself to get help with my therapist has also been largely unsuccessful. I've been trying my damnest to get through this school strong and while the grades that did get through have been good so far, but at what cost did it come at? After all this burnout and suffering I've just been starting to halfass my content again. I want to learn, but I don't have much more juice left for doing more than what I am now.

Like I said earlier, if you got mental health issues that can be debilitating, you've probably got better options than UMD that are maybe a little better on this front such as a smaller school. Other than behavioral health providing affordable therapy and psychiatry, this school's been an almost completely hostile environment for a ADHD + Bipolar student like me. If you do end up going here, don't be afraid to take your time and stray from the 4 year graduation path. Trying to keep up with it for me has always ended up with me having to withdraw from a class anyway. There's no shame in withdrawing, but I've been having to do it for a class in most of my semesters and it gets really demoralizing after a while as well as being a waste of money because of UMD's tight refund schedule.

There's a few other pretty bad experiences I've had here, but this post has already gotten long enough so I'd rather not add those on.

I also really don't want to hear any ""just use a planner"" and stuff like that. I've heard it a billion times already and I'm doing my best to keep things organized enough to get through this despite my conditions. It's likely not very constructive to say these kinds of things at this point.

edit: I intend to take a semester or two off next year. I'm also wondering if whether or not taking medical leave from classes right now and getting a refund for my classes right now can be a thing. I've had enough of this school and this pandemic man."

I am entering college in this fall. I was lucky enough to get into CS major at University of Washington Seattle as an in-state resident.  I am planning on applying for F-1 before school starts, so I can get F-1 before my sophomore year begins at the latest.  Once I get my F-1, I will be able to use CPT to get an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

When should I start applying for interviews? Should I apply as soon as my sophomore year start? (September 2022)

Will doing internships in Big N companies help my chance getting OPT and H1-B when I graduate? If so, how many hours should I dedicate to leetcode everyday?

What are some suggestions/advices you can give to an international student?

I'm a GIS intern so I'm not a professional but I'm working on a historical project which uses archived maps from the 1700's. They are considerably inaccurate. Georeferencing them has been easy, but I noticed that the result looks lossy and stretched where it was previously a very fine lossless image quality. I'm wondering if there are any ways to georeference a historical map that retains the image quality? The image is of the contiguous US and Latin America but the only region which is visually important for the project is Texas. As long as I can georeference the map while preserving the map image quality for Texas it will look excellent. I've been looking into finding or even creating a custom projection system which better aligns the basemap layer with the map image. I've tried a few different georeferencing methods with no luck so far."

A few interview questions I see that are common in general are ""tell me about yourself"" or ""tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership,"" and I'm really not sure how I would answer these.

I chose to major in CS not out of a passion or even a particular interest, but rather because I didn't know what else to do and I figured the area I live in would have CS related jobs that could keep me financially stable while I figured out myself. I think that because of the lack of genuine interest, I didn't participate in anything CS (or even non CS) related outside of school, and even in school, I didn't join any CS clubs or the like; I just pretty much plodded along with my schoolwork, and the only CS projects I've done are the ones assigned in class.

As for leadership, maybe it's the way leadership or a leader is defined in my mind, but I dislike being a leader. Unless I'm with a group of friends, I shy away from leadership positions because I'm afraid of the extra responsibilities of managing people and the repercussions and/or alienation that might happen if I make a call and it fails. I'd think that I'm mostly fine with just working on things that are assigned to me.

With that in mind, how would I honestly yet positively answer these interview questions?"
mb238l,12,2021-03-22,School vs. Industry,goPSUshaun3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mb238l/school_vs_industry/,"Hi All,

I am curious as to how much industry differs from college coursework for Computer Science majors. I did my undergrad in chemical engineering and loved every part of school. I was unable to get an internship in chemical engineering during my summers of undergrad, so I never really got to experience what things were like in industry while I was in school. Fast forward five years of being in industry doing typical chemical engineering jobs and I hate every part of it.

I am now going back to school for a postbacc in Computer Science and I am wondering how likely I am to fall back into the same situation in a few years. I can't get enough of programming and have really enjoyed the CS classes I have taken in my free time (CS50, Nand2Tetris parts 1 &amp; 2, etc.). Will I be using the things that I learn in my post bacc CS classes each day when I get into industry? How much does industry differ from the coursework?"
mb24s0,104,2021-03-22,Lessons from my MBA experience: Road to $200K+ from $40K pre-MBA,Fortunate_MBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/mb24s0/lessons_from_my_mba_experience_road_to_200k_from/,"(Throwaway account for privacy purposes)

**LONG POST INCOMING - TLDR BELOW**

I wanted to give a little overview of my experience deciding, applying, and completing my MBA to ultimately land an incredible opportunity (non-rotational CxO/MBA Program). I hope that this can benefit future applicants and candidates, but as always, this is strictly MY experience as a plebeian non-M7er (YMMV).

I will say I had a relatively average profile compared to most posters on here (dinged at Chico with no interview) so if I can do it, I’m sure others can as well. 

**Profile at a glance:**

\- 28M, (mixed; white/middle eastern)

\- Undergrad, Applied Economics (sub-3.0 GPA)

\- GMAT: 710

\- 2.5+ Years’ experience at a start-up (spearheaded a $100K+ seed-round)

\- 1.5+ Year experience at FAANG (operations/logistics)

**Accepted Offer (Figures in $USD)**

Base: $140K

Signing Bonus: $40K

Performance Bonus (target): $35K

Equity/Shares (target): $75K

**First Year Target Compensation:** $215K (Cash) + $75K (Equity) = $290,000

(For reference, the signing bonus I received was in the ballpark of my pre-MBA income)

**Program Selection**

I wanted to do an MBA for a while since, in my country/city, the degree is heavily subsidized. However, I did want to change geographies (ideally relocate to a major city), so I decided to shop around for the right program. 

I decided to join a [1-Year (non-US, non-INSEAD) MBA program](https://find-mba.com/lists/other-top-business-school-lists/top-10-one-year-mba-programs-worldwide), since I already had decent experience coming in, I felt that I could do without an internship. This approach isn’t advisable for all profiles (or certain industries), but I did my research and felt it was the right choice for me. 

I would consider my MBA a target program, as most major players are actively recruiting on-campus, but it isn’t a feeder by any measure. I connected with many alumni and it felt like the right fit. Given my profile, I figured my ceiling was likely T15 (Darden, Cornell, Duke) or INSEAD/LBS. I was admitted to my program with a sizeable scholarship and that sealed the deal. 

**Mindset coming into the Program**

My primary objective for joining an MBA was to land an offer that emphasized career growth, financial gain and ultimately put me in the best position for a leadership role within 7-10 years. Naturally, Consulting was a primary target, along with certain LDP/GM Programs. 

At this point, I didn’t know CxO/MBA Programs even existed, but I was going in with a relatively open mind and knew that my profile was not likely to get much attention from IB/Tech PM roles, so I effectively eliminated those options before even starting the program. 

**Pre-Recruitment**

As you can imagine in a one-year MBA, everything moves at a blistering pace. I’m sure this advice can also apply to two-year MBAs; you will just need to adjust timelines accordingly. 

Within the first few weeks, you find yourself juggling courses, exam prep, cohort engagement, career development, plus any extracurriculars while trying to get started with networking and interview prep. You need to be very disciplined and methodical (think 80/20) about what requires more time (allocation varies from person to person), and what will significantly improve your profile for recruitment; you have to be realistic and play to your strengths.

I knew early on that I needed to make up for my UG GPA (if it even mattered) and my GMAT didn’t exactly jump off the page, so I ran and got elected to one of the more prominent roles within my MBA; think Class or major Association President (finance/consulting/tech). 

**Recruitment**

As I mentioned above, I was honest with myself about my chances and was selective with the firms I networked with. I ended up applying to about a dozen jobs during our on-campus recruitment period and was fortunate enough to get invited to first rounds by about half of them. Surprisingly, the ones I networked with the most, were the ones that didn’t invite me at all. 

I had very diligently been preparing my story, behavioural and case interviews. I cannot emphasize enough how important your behavioural preparation is to secure an offer. While case/techinical interview skills are critical, I found myself hit a point of diminishing returns after 20 mock cases with peers and consultants. Instead of mocking more and more, spend time reviewing cases on your own. Also devote time to revising your stories, it helps with networking and sets the tone during interviews. 

My preparation paid off as I reached the final rounds with every firm I interviewed with, I didn’t get invited to any MBB first rounds, but I did interview with multiple T2s and boutiques. 

**Dealing with Rejection**

A big piece of advice here, don’t let any rejection faze you too much. I thought I connected well with some firms, I was invited to private events, had great coffee chats with alumni, but was not offered an interview. These things happen, some of my classmates with Ivy-league undergrads, 99th percentile test scores, dean’s list and all were having a hard time, so who was I to complain.

Survivor Bias is rampant in the MBA bubble (the irony of saying this is not lost on me lol) and you have to be aware of it. Make sure to connect with peers and alumni who didn't land an offer and chances are most will have worked just as hard as everybody else. Put yourself in the right frame of mind to handle any rejection because **it WILL happen**. You need to be able to process it quickly and keep moving forward. 

**Post-Recruitment**

I got multiple final round dings, I even got waitlisted by one firm (didn't even know that was a thing lol). Each rejection was tougher than the last, but they all played an import role in the end result. 

A lot of luck was involved, but ultimately, I ended up securing multiple offers, mostly in consulting (T2 &amp;amp; Boutique). Offers were from US and international offices, a mix of HCOL and MCOL cities. One offer was to join a non-rotational CxO/MBA program for a PE-backed holding company. While I was more focused on consulting coming in, I think this was too great an opportunity to pass up. I had direct engagement with multiple C-Suite members during the interview process and even got a call from one of the portfolio company’s CEO, asking me personally to join their senior management team. 

**Biggest takeaways (TLDR)**

**• Be honest with yourself; understand your weaknesses and leverage your strengths**

Be realistic and put more emphasis on elements that you’re good at, and don’t worry as much about your shortcomings. It’s easy to think that you’ll be the exception when entering your MBA, everybody and their mom wants VC/PE/PM/MBB, but keep in mind that there are so many other incredible opportunities out there that could potentially be an even better fit for your goals. 

• **Positioning &amp; Perception are more important than Skills &amp; Experience**

This goes hand-in-hand with leveraging your strengths, and one of the reasons I think developing a compelling career narrative (through stories) is so pivotal. Most firms in the top-tier range are hiring you for your potential and not your ability to crack cases or perform a specific task. They are thinking long-term, and truly believe you have what it takes to make Partner/C-Suite/MD/VP or else they wouldn’t be paying a 20-something-year-old a quarter-million dollars. Lean into your potential and drive it home during your networking, coffee chats, and in interviews. 

• **Time, Energy and Resource allocation is pivotal to success**

Most candidates in an MBA are aware of this but don’t apply it as much as they should. A target MBA is a once-in-a-lifetime experience where you’re surrounded by incredibly talented, like-minded individuals, all learning and bonding together for a year or two. Put yourself out there and engage with everybody, but be mindful of your courses, networking, interview prep. I ended up taking on multiple leadership roles with MBA affiliates and associations; this allowed me to interact with my cohort, while also building skills and bolstering my profile. I spent way more time on networking and interview prep than I did on courses, but you need to understand what will make your profile stand out most, and drive those factors home. 

**COVID-19 Disclaimer**

While I did do a (z)MBA, I didn’t want to draw any attention to an anomaly of a year. The advice and experience I share can be applied to any year, any target MBA, and most circumstances. "

Anyways, I currently am a senior computer science student and am very grateful to say I have two offers for an internship this coming summer 2021. I've thought about it a lot and was wondering if anyone could offer any experience or advice about either or both internship experiences. Here are the only differences I am aware of right now:

JP Morgan Chase: 

1. $40.50 an hour
2. Wilmington, DE

Walmart:

1. $1,826.92 biweekly
2. Bentonville, AR

Both positions are for software engineering and both are for 10 weeks. 

What Im mainly looking for are a couple of things. First, I would like to work full time at which ever company I intern for. Second, my interests lie right now in computer networks and security, so which ever company has the most potential there would be ideal. Third, I would like to be as close to my home in Damascus MD, as much as possible. For the last point, I know both of these internships are far from home, but I was hoping after the internship I could try to transfer to a closer headquarters (Both companies have a location in Reston, VA). 

Like I said, if anyone has anything to share about locations, managers, teams, overall experience, even full time experience, transportation, company vibe, please please share whatever you want. Thank you in advance!"

That internship is part time, 3 days a week (roughly). I just got another internship offer, also part time, but unpaid and remote. I know this sub is about to flame me and say it's a bad choice, what with being unpaid and remote and all, but hear me out. I switched to CS from another field pretty late, and as a result had to load up on a bunch of classes and wasn't able to get an internship any of my previous years in computer science (I do have 2 other internships in marketing/UX design tho). I am graduating next may, and from seeing these horror stories about applying for jobs, I am a little freaked out about my lack of experience in programming jobs. I actually have been getting some interviews at legit tech companies recently, but I didn't really study leetcode that much (stupid I know) so I was getting destroyed. So over the summer, (may-august) I am considering 2 options.

1, do my part time internship I already accepted, not do the other one, and spend the other 4 days of the week during my summer time learning leetcode, mock interviews, doing a major project, and learning other useful stuff (docker, CI/CD, aws, etc.) so that I'm good for the fall. Try to do a part time internship next year during  the school year (taking a part time load next year), to get extra real world experience.

2, do both interviews, spend my nights and weekends doing LC/projects/etc. Basically the same plan as the above, but more time spent on the remote, unpaid internship.

Any thoughts on what I should do? I really think it's ideal to have 2 internships before I graduate/while I'm applying full time so that my resume has some shit on it. I'm just petrified about applying for jobs, so any advice is appreciated, lol."

**Extracurricular Activities (in no particular order and I'm just listing all of them off of the top of my head so I'm not sticking to 10):**

Science Olympiad member (since 9th grade. Its my fav EC in school but I don't have any leadership positions lmfao. I've gotten regional and state medals for it)

Speach and Debate member (since 9th grade. I may not even include it though cause I didn't get any awards and I hate it)

Medicine club member ( since 9th grade. hopefully a leadership position next year)

HOSA member (just this year cause it just got started. I got a regional medal for it but we haven't done the state competition so hopefully I can place as well)

Tutoring club (since this year. Unimportant leadership position)

Tutoring (just started this year so only like 30 hrs)

Vanderbilt Orchestra member (but its not very high level lmao)

My county's Honors orchestra

Governor's School for bio and stats ( last summer. Only 30 kids from the state are chosen so i guess that's prestegious (maybe not idk how many applied). We did a research project over covid-19 there and presented it to a pannel of researchers so that's cool ig)

100+ volunteer hours at Room-in-the-inn at my church (I haven't counted the hours yet actually but it has to be a lot since I volunteered every monday for like 4 hours since like 7th grade. But who knows, maybe its not that much)

There's this club at my school where we go play instruments at various nursing homes and I have hours from that too (I haven't counted. probably like 30 or so). Hopefully I can get a leadership position but idk

Other various service projects

I helped my mother with her math tutoring buisness if that counts. I'm thinking of writing my essay about it (since its really important to me and the reason why we came to America) and it has taken up a lot of my after school time from 3rd grade to 10th grade (when it closed)

Honor societies (Mu Alpha Theta, SNHS, Tri M, NHS (hopefully))

I help my mom with some neuroscience research she's doing but idk if it counts cause it hasn't really taken off yet (and also its hers not mine)

I did tennis in 9th grade at school and over the summer in 10th but I still suck and I have nothing to show for it so its probably not going on the app lol

Learned R and Python but no certification (yet)

**Prospective ECs:**

\- I am really interested in some summer health related programs (the JHU Global health leadership confrence, CDC Museum Disease Detective Camp, an Emory Pre-college program). I've already applied for the JHU one but I have yet to apply for the CDC one and the Emory one. Idk how prestegious each one is but they all look super cool and I would be so excited to attend any one of them

\- I want to try and get an internship at a hospital that my dad works for but idk if that would count or look impressive since my dad works for the company. It will still be a good experience though!

\- I want to start SOMETHING at my school but idk what to start. I was thinking of a club preparing for the USABO (cuz in our school we just show up for it lmao), a research club (but idk if many people would be interested or how exactly it would work), or an outside thing that helps students in the urban area (but that seems a litlle preachy lmao. I still would love to help tho). The thing I'm worried about is that since they would start in senior year colleges will think I'm just starting it for college and disregard it (which is partially true but I also want experience being a leader and I do hope these clubs could make an impact) and also there would be no impact of the club until after I've applied for college (which is fine, it just makes the club not stand out on the app)

\- This is just for fun but I really like Kpop and i want to organize something kpop related at my school (its prob not going on my app but ig it shows how qUiRky I am)

**Awards:**

Idk what constitues as an award (like do the awards from club competitions count?) so idk what I'll put here

I got the wholesome award like twice so I think I should be an auto-admit to most schools

**Letter of Recs:**

Well so I maybe kind ofhave like the worst work ethic ever so I'm pretty sure most of my teachers hate me. But my APES teacher always comments on how smart I am so that's somthing ig. But yeah these recs aren't gonna be great unless I somehow ̶c̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶p̶o̶t̶e̶n̶t̶i̶a̶l̶ ̶a̶d̶h̶d̶ become the smartest kid in school 

**Essays:** Idk ig I'm average. But two people have said that my potential essay topic is pretty good so lets just hope I execute this well

**Schools my clown ass is reaching for:** Vandy (yes ik its a super reach but its been my dream school for forever ok), Emory, Wake Forest, Case Western, Tulane, VaTech, GaTech, Villanova, NYU, I'll probably apply to Duke, Rice and JHU just for fun (cuz I know I'll get rejected hard), I'll obviously apply for saftey schools too (watch me get rejected from them as well LMFAO)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll probably cut down that list once I see the abysmal amount of essays I have to write, these are just some i'm interested in

**Reverse chance me criteria:** I live in the southeast so I would prefer a southeastern school but any school on the eastern half of the country is good honestly. I just need schools that are good and have an ok chance of admitting me. I would prefer a larger school and a private school (but public is fine). Also a school that will look good as I apply for med-school. Idrc abt greek life and sports. And for atmosphere, as long as its studious w/o being too stressful and everyone is nice, I am fine

And also if you must know, I currently have a D in calc so im probably gonna get rejected from everywhere but one can only hope

Thanks for reading. Be honest but don't be too harsh cause my self-esteem is already destroyed from spending too much time on here"

My last internship is too outdated to list( got sick during college and had to take a break which is why there's a gap). I had a good interview with Amazon but then they told me they cancelled internships for the rest of 2021. I'm just trying to figure out what I can do to be more marketable so I can gain experience. I've redone my resume and had my college career services look over it and told me that it's good. I'm still trying to find a path I want to go down (cyber security sounds cool) I know Java, Java script, .NET, Python, C++, currently learning C#  I don't know if that's too many programs or what I should even focus on. My advisor thinks that tech support is the same thing as software development so I'm flying solo here and just need some kind of internship so I can actually know someone in the industry and be a great developer and know what I need to know to be successful. I've asked professors for help but they don't want to bother helping me and I'm just at my wits end."

While I prepare to make the most of it so I can hopefully receive a return offer, a few questions started to bubble up in my head. Before entering the field, all I knew about computer science/software engineering were short-sighted advantages such as lots of job opportunities and high salaries. After going to school, working on projects and leetcode problems, applying, interviewing, facing rejections, and rejoicing over offers, I now ask myself:

**What will my career look like 10-20 years from now?** 

From what I've read online, two paths seem to be the most popular:

1. Stay working as a software engineer, and become a ""high-standing"" engineer at the company. 
2. Transition from working as an engineer to managing other engineers and engineering teams.

Are these really the most common paths? What are the pros and cons of each? What are the other options available? What are the other important questions I am not asking myself/others?

Thanks in advance!"

I have a chemical engineering background (graduated in 2018) and have worked for two companies in the last 3 years. 

As I have spent about 10,000$ on this Bootcamp, I would like to get a job at the end of it. Has anyone here tried the InternGroup or any such ""pay for internship"" programs? 

What is the best course of action for someone in my position to break into the tech industry?

mb73pz,9,2021-03-23,Odds of getting into a Top 10 University with unique situation?,Melodic_Stock_9430,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/mb73pz/odds_of_getting_into_a_top_10_university_with/,"This is kind of a long story so I apologize if there is any confusion.

To begin, I have had an extremely horrible last 6 years. At 18 years old, I graduated high school with a 4.9 gpa, 34 act, and was accepted to a highly rated engineering state school, with the goal of attending a top university for an mba. Unfortunately, before attending, I caught a life threatening illness that completely flipped my life around. To not release too much information, this illness is rare and pretty much destroyed my body's system and left me with lifelong conditions and health problems. I went from a D1 athlete to a frail shell of a person I was so sick. It has taken me years to being able to operate at a 50-75% level, which I am thankful for.

After initially getting sick, I tried to go back to school. However, this turned out to be a bad experience. From physically not being able to get to class, to being so sick I couldn't remember anything at all (this illness affects inflammation in the brain). Therefore, my grades were not as perfect as they should have been, roughly a 3.4-3.5 for a few quarters. However, sometimes I was so sick I had to medically withdraw from school. Therefore, I have many medical withdrawals on my transcript. All doctors actually told me to give up on school as my body couldn't handle it and I frankly would probably die if I kept trying as hard as I was at the time. After medically withdrawing from undergrad, I realized I was not able to go to school in my condition.

However, after 3-4 years of healing, I decided I had to try to go back to school, even if I was only at 50%. I had to transfer to a new university (not as highl ranked) because of the time-lapse but also because I needed more resources at the time in order to be successful. Through a lot of pain, hard work, I graduated last semester in three years with a 4.0 gpa summa cum laude in Data Science/Analytics (roughly a 3.94 if you count previous schools gpa).

I now have my sights on attending a top 10 university for an mba. I still have to take the gmat but from practice tests I expect to get a score of 730-760 by the time I am finished. I know work experience is the biggest driving force for mba applications, which is where I am lacking due to my illness for many years. I am currently working at an investment bank doing Data analytics for them, and if I am to apply next fall for the following fall, I will have 1 year full experience with internships at the time of application, and 2 years full experience by the time of attending.

What are my odds of getting into a top 10 university given my academic history? In all honesty, my goal of attending one of these schools for an mba really drove me through life after I got sick but I am concerned schools won't accept me cause of it. I don't have the crazy amount of work experience (5+ years) like many others due to my illness and have a wild ride of medical withdrawals through my initial college career. I really have experience hell and am concerned that its limitations/history will prevent schools from wanting me. I would prefer not too wait a few years to apply as I have already had to wait so many years to get through undergrad. I currently am doing the best I have since I got sick so I am hoping life will come through for grad school. Thank you for any advise."

Any advice?,Steve4SmashHater,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mb7ig6/feeling_lost_and_hopeless_for_technical_field_i/,"The thing is I was attending graduate classes at a rough time in my life (relationship issues) and I never completed my master's but it was mostly in hardware based studies. It was during this time that I met other individuals and I began taking initiative in my free time to learn languages and how to use various IDEs and I began to realize that I really enjoy coding way more than I was young in my undergrad. The experience that I do have outside of the 3 years in my careers is in internships in my grad/undergrad studies where I did use programming in some aspects. I was okay in the beginning taking whatever engineering job I could take initially but as time went on I realized even when I mention to my managers/coworkers that I want to get involved in any coding experience I can't get any. And now I apply to any jobs and I specifically list under my skill sets that I have knowledge in these languages. The thing is I feel for entry level jobs, the people they hire (new grads e.g.) don't know much about daily job tasks and have 0 technical job experience but still get hired just because they have a degree computer engineering or computer science.

So a little background info on me is that I have an undergrad degree in electrical engineering with a job at a large defense contractor and have been at a previous defense contractor in my previous job and in total I have worked a little over 3 years in my career and I have a security clearance. The thing is is that I can not ever get a interview for even an entry level or junior level software position that I apply to. I have experience although not at the level of an actual software engineer, to be able to analyze, debug, and write code in languages such as C++, Python, and Java. I don't have a huge background in these languages but I know how the syntax works, what OOP is, and what data structures are.

TL;DR:  I am having trouble even getting considered for interview for even entry level software roles even with multiple years of technical experience. I have begun again this year to apply again with jobs that require my security clearance hoping maybe since I have a clearance I will have a better chance even if I do not have a software role in the past. Any advice?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

I asked like six teachers for recs and sent them to different places depending on the traits of the schools I applied to and what their scholarships looked for (service, leadership, participation in class, etc.). all of my recommendations were strong if I were to guess. 

**Interviews**

i don’t know how to really rate these but take these explanations. 

**wake forest:** did this before starting any apps. interviewer was nice. very short. they asked about the books I liked to read and I started stumbling omg I don’t read that much on my own time. 

**upenn:** great guy. they were in my desired career field so it was a great convo. wish we could’ve went for longer but they were on a time constraint I think. 

**northwestern:** cool interviewer. seemed to believe that I deserved a spot in NW more than I did which was cool. 

**cornell:** very lovely. it was a family of cornellians it was very adorable and fun. lasted over two hours actually. 

**duke:** nice person. they weren’t as energetic as the rest but we had a mutual teacher that I connected them to which was cool. 

**Essays**

my first draft of my common app essay was the one I went with. i wrote it as an assignment for my ap lang class after the exam. the teacher said it was stellar. (tweaked for grammar and vividness over the summer) the essay was about a trip to africa and how it changed my perception of my heritage and confidence as an individual. I’m proud of it. supplements were about how I want mental health to be taken more seriously in communities of color, as well as some extremely blunt, political takes.

* Cornell University RD (likely letter)
* Vanderbilt University RD (MOSAIC)

* Case Western Reserve University RD (rejected PPSP)
* other safeties

*Waitlists:*

* Johns Hopkins University RD
* George Washington University RD (Rejected BA/MD)
* Duke University RD
* University of Pennsylvania RD

*Rejections:*

* Yale University RD

**final thoughts:**
sorry for the vagueness of the profile. I am sooooo happy this is finally over. very blessed and content with the results. if I were to give any advice to anyone, it’d be to not develop any emotional attachment to a school despite your preferences, as it has definitely kept me sane. don’t say you have a “dream school”. for the longest time, I envisioned UPenn as my end all be all and I got waitlisted...it didn’t hurt though and I wish that for everyone. remain humble, but also recognize your worth and don’t seek your validation through schools. you’re all well accomplished. don’t think of all you have done in high school as something you did just to enter a set of brick buildings on the east coast. all that shit helped you become better and smarter, don’t take your experience for granted :D. good luck and congrats to everyone!"

* The food courts 
* Tuition about 9k for freshman's ear  
* Networks
* Tech school 

UCD Pros: 

* They have a fantastic Statistics department with lots of resources 
* Close enough to home that it'll not be too costly to go back
* Tuition, they gave me a merit-based scholarship of 7500 a year estimated cost is about 4k freshman year  
* Nice small college town 
* The on-campus food option looks pretty good 
* Large fields for running and exploring 
* the cows 

Cal Poly Pros:  

* They have a small and very resourceful and good statistic department. Only about 30 graduates a year. 
* Small class sizes 
* The location and campus are amazing. I like the campus with all its hills and trails for running. Its gym/rec center just looks like a place ill have a blast in.
* Job and internship opportunities,  they have a really high employment rate and have career fairs every quarter. I hear that even freshmen can get internships at companies around the state and that the local Amazon office takes a lot of interns from Poly.
* Learn by doing model, tho don't know how this would work out with Stats. 
* Close enough to home to visit on a weekend 

UCLA Cons:

* It's in LA. I would like to be in an area where I can bike, walk or take public transit to do stuff. Would preferably not want to have a car freshman year.
* The curve. I've read in other subs that it's more about just getting the grade instead of learning really interests me that much in that case. Don't really know about could someone give me insight? 
* Semester system, I won't be able to take many different classes to better my skills. Could anyone back me up on this or am I purely wrong on this? 
* Large general ed classes. Not being able to go to OH and get hold of the professor. Do they have tutoring services there? 
* Farthest from home, this isn't too bad at about 7 hours compared to 2 and 3 from Davis and Poly.
* It's expensive, money isn't that tight but LA rent is just insane. 
* More theory-based teaching, don't know how practical it is to get an internship

UCD Cons:

* Davis the town seems a bit boring it self
* Theory-based teaching just like at UCLA
* It's in north cal but not really. Job and internship opportunities would seem not as good as the other two. Getting research on campus seems pretty easy tho.
* Why didn't you choose UCLA!
* There computer science department is kinda eh,  might switch to cs and minor in Stats
* Don't know what their college of letters and science( statistics major there) means when they say there a liberal arts college. It may be beneficial to me if I can take different types of math and cs courses. If they make me take more gender study and literature courses than I would at the other schools, then I'm not going.
* Large classes 

Cal poly cons: 

* Its the most expensive so far at about 12k 
* Getting housing there is hard 
* food choices are eh 
* gen ed classes heavily impacted 
* low 4-year grad rate may need 5 to finish 
* getting a job outside of California with a CSU degree is harder compared with a UC degree 

These are just a few of my thoughts that I have found through reading other Reddit articles and reading school websites. Poly and Davis both let me join advising programs so that seems like a huge benefit. It would also be ideal for the college to have tutoring services, especially for writing and grammar. As for costs, I could always become an RA bringing the cost of any of these schools down to zero for the following years.  I'm still kinda confused on what's the difference between theory-based learning vs hands-on learning for stats. I've only visited cal poly campus so far,  going to the other in the following weeks. 

Does my thinking seem reasonable? Was there stuff I've got wrong from any of the schools?  Any other facts about any of the schools I've missed that seem critical?  Just kinda want to know the different inputs of people. I've still haven't gone to any info session of any of the schools they start next week."
mb9ccw,2,2021-03-23,Part time CS masters program,Clumsyndicate,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mb9ccw/part_time_cs_masters_program/,"I’m on course to graduate in 3 years and I have a big N internship lined up for this summer with very good full time conversion rates. Currently a sophomore. The internship is on hardcore software architecture with lots of C++, which I’m good at. But I’m also very interested in Machine Learning, this I really want to pursue a masters program (like at Stanford!!)

It seems like a waste of a full time opportunity if I take a maters full time, so I think part time is a pretty good option (and more economical) with a specialization in ML.

Does anyone have similar considerations, I’d be interested to hear more opinions."

mbasjp,48,2021-03-23,It is starting to feel like getting an ‘entry level’ job in IT is next to impossible,xileaa,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mbasjp/it_is_starting_to_feel_like_getting_an_entry/,"I started studying for my BSc (Hons) in cyber security at the start of this year and I am also studying for my CompTIA A+, I plan to do all the core CompTIA certs and some others. 

Anyway, I’ve been browsing through some entry level IT jobs such as help desk, IT support etc. And I have noticed the requirements of basically all of them are 2 years experience, a degree, an abundance of certs. Even for an unpaid intern position I found, require a years experience?! What!!? 

What is going on? I’m in London, UK by the way, so I am hoping there are just lack of jobs due to Covid. 

I was planning to try and get a job after I completed my A+, whilst studying for my degree, but every time I browse through the jobs I just feel disheartened. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I didn’t think it would be this hard either. Or maybe that was just me being naive. 

I suppose my question is, what advice do you guys have? How did you break into the IT field? I’m really not in a position to go and do a years unpaid internship but it feels like that’s the only way right now! 

Thank you in advance."

&amp;#x200B;

**Little Background**

* I graduated from a reputed college in India in Computer Science in May 2019. I hated coding during college and never tried to focus on it. I felt overwhelmed in college due to the competitive environment there.
* After May 2019, I had no idea what to do after graduation. I never sat for campus placements even though my college had a very nice record. At that time I didn't want to end up in this area.
* 3 months passed by, I did nothing (I live with my parents) and was just home. Fortunately I had some good friends during college, who suggested me that there's still a chance that I can try to get in the field, If I start fresh, as there's no college pressure now and assured me that I can do it.
* I was already familiar with python and spent like 2 months (Sept-Oct 2019) doing easy level and then medium level leetcode questions, 1 problem daily. (Focused on only Basic Arrays, strings, linked list and Tree questions).
* Then my friend suggested me to try Flask, which led me to enroll in a course named Web programming with Python and JS (CS50 WEB) by Harvard University.
* This course entirely changed my perspective, and was like a direction that lead me deeper in the web development area. I spent (Oct 2019 - Dec 2019) 2-3 months trying to finish this course at my own pace. 
* I already knew HTML and CSS before. Some stuff I learned through this course were Git, basic db stuff, Flask, Basic JS concepts, Django, dom manipulation, and concepts related to scaling, security etc.
* So with this course, I created like 4 projects from scratch, some using Flask, and some using django. And I hosted this apps on Heroku. And then started applying for jobs(Jan 2020 - )
* So initially I felt overwhelmed while applying, as I never interviewed before. But eventually coped up with it and kept applying and interviewing. I got very less interviews.

**COVID period** 

* Then COVID came around March 2020 first week and it added to my already demotivated journey of job hunting.
* During that time I learned Angular. And tried to revamp my previous projects (which were just static sites) with angular and I integrated them. During this time I learnt many new things about JS, I deeply learnt about how Web works, how Internet works, Networking concepts, HTTP, REST, OOPs and all the basic stuff.
* So I had a pretty good idea about what kind of questions I should expect from an interview and I would prepare accordingly.
* Around August 2020 last week, one of a no name angel list startup offered me an internship role for 2 months with a joke of stipend. As I was desperate and had no prior internship, I accepted this opportunity and spend two months remotely doing this internship.

**Internship (Sept - Nov 2020)**

* Even though there were like literally 5-6 people in the company, and I knew that I'm just a cheap labor in name of an intern, I tried to make most out of it, and learned many new things there as well. I had no regrets.
* They even offered me Full time role, again with joke of a salary. But this time I declined, as there was no proper structure, no testing, nothing. And I had a feeling that I would now get a new job quickly but it wasn't like so.

**After Internship (Nov 2020 - March 2021)**

* So again I started applying. Usually I'd try to apply like 20 companies on a single day. Or some weeks I'd apply daily to like 4-5 companies.
* From when I started tracking (from July 2020) of which companies I've applied to in Google sheets file, I've applied to around 250+ companies. I know that's a huge number of companies. It has come down to how good your resume is, and whether your cover letter is good enough.
* Mostly from these applications I had potentially like 15 companies where I had gone through at least one round of hiring process seriously.
* I had many phone screens as well, where sometimes the company didn't considered me a good fit, while other times it was vice versa.
* And also I've been ghosted by many after interviews.
* During this period, I have encountered mostly take-home tasks and very few leet code style screenings.
* I would only do the take-homes If I feel that I'm not being used as a free labor. Also I had learnt about Nodejs during intern, So I would try to learn new stuff, and also try to create new projects. But mostly I would try to revamp or improve my existing ones.

**Breakthrough**

* So I came across the company (which is a well known startup in India) from which I got the offer. I came to know about this company in Feb 2021 when I saw a tweet from someone on my TL related to the company. So I went on their website and applied from there.
* So I had like 4 rounds with them which lasted for almost a month
   * Basic Technical Discussion
   * Take home task -&gt; Code Review + A Live task was given, to make an improvement in the code that I submitted.
   * Another technical round (DS, Algorithms and System design questions)
   * Final round with CTO (technical discussion type, cultural fit check)
* I knew that all of my rounds went well and I had cleared all the rounds as HR informed me that they have positive feedback.
* I usually try to avoid initiating salary discussion from my end and try my best to not give a number from my side, during initial phases.
* After all rounds were over they then asked me about the expected CTC. So I was prepared for that, I had already researched on glassdoor like what the company provides to same role in the same location. Now I had this range with me which I needed to mention when asked.
* So I quoted for a salary range that I never would have even thought about an year before. I was undervaluing myself very much to like almost half of what I quoted.
* They accepted my quoted range and offer me the lower bound one. I wanted to play safe as I had no other offers, but even though I tried asking if there's any room for increment. HR said they might need to discuss internally. When they shared the letter, it was more than what they initially offered and I was happy with that.

**Some thoughts/ Approaches that I followed**

* I am from India, so there might be some different approaches in reaching out to companies as this sub is mostly US based. Mostly I've applied through Indeed, Linked In, sometimes through angel list and through any leads I could get. I even try to get list of some good companies and would literally apply on their career section. Obviously I didn't aim for any FAANG. I just wanted to enter in the industry with average salary (that doesn't mean you aim low).
* Although this approach has very less success. One advice I got was to get referrals from your network. But I didn't try getting referrals as I was kind of shy in asking (big mistake and setback for me). 
* I prepared a Google keep, where I stored all the links to blogs, concepts, articles which I could refer to before interview. My intern role was more frontend based, but I tried to learn backend as well and would apply for Full Stack roles. So this was kind of slow down factor, and I believed that I should have just focused on one of them. 
* Before an interview, I say this to myself that it's nothing but a discussion, and no one is gonna judge me.
* Most difficult thing when an interview begins is to answer the question ""Tell Me about yourself?"". Your answer to this question would be like a foundation for how your rest of the interview is gonna be.
   *  And I know when you have a gap and no prior experience, it kind of becomes awkward answering that.
   * I would begin describing my graduation year and major.
   * What I did after college, how would I utilize my time, which technologies I learnt.
   * What's the most recent experience I had, If any.
* I knew that I have drastically improved my communication skills over this period. And I added that to my advantage.
* I would always try to be humble when interviewing, and would always speak softly. If I didn't know about something, I would simply say that I'm not aware about that and might have to look. Or I would politely ask them If they could tell me the answer (depends on situation).
* Reverse interview questions are important and you definitely need to ask interviewer questions at the end, to standout from others. Questions should be interesting and should be framed in a way that can make the interviewer more attentive towards you.
* After every interview,  I would note about which things I wasn't able to answer in a doc file, so I wouldn't miss that next time.
* There were times were I felt burn out and demotivated. So it's okay to take a break and one should know when to take them.
* I have been an active member on this subreddit since I started job searching, also I followed some cool people on tech twitter, which were helpful in some way or other.
* At last, I'm satisfied with what I have presently, and the wait and journey was worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**


* Began my job hunting journey from scratch after my graduation in CS.
* No prior Internships.
* Built projects during the time.
* Landed an internship in a small startup. They offered full time, but I declined.
* Started job search again.
* 250+ applications.
* Got an offer I never would have imagined one year before.

**PS**


* This post was meant for motivating others who are on the same boat. If someone like me could do this, you definitely can.
* I won't mention the company name or my college name as I prefer to be anonymous on reddit.
*  I don't want to directly reveal the CTC as well but for those people who are asking me, its closer to the lower bound of 10-15 LPA range"

I have 1 year of internship experience  + 1 year of full-time work experience + 1 year of freelance work experience.

My GPA for both degrees should be 4.00 (assuming everything continues as it is).

For USA:

I think my best option would be to join a company that can do internal transfers to the US (which companies do this though?) or to get more experience then try to find a job that will sponsor me an H1B, maybe in 2 more years? Can anyone provide guidance?

For Canada:

Do I need more experience or can I start applying now?"

I'm a last year student of the Computer Engineering degree in Spain. I was told by one of the institutions of my University that I needed to upload a brief document about my internship if I wanted it to appear in the ""Diploma Supplement"".

I started digging, and this is what's all about: [https://ec.europa.eu/education/diploma-supplement\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/education/diploma-supplement_en)

Does this have any kind of value as a new grad? Should I ask to receive said Diploma once I finish the degree? Is this important for jobs outside Spain?"

mbfczi,190,2021-03-23,I don't trust The Sturgeon Farmers Collective.,tjaylea,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mbfczi/i_dont_trust_the_sturgeon_farmers_collective/,"*""Truth is objective, results are necessary and what you print can be neither so long as it's gripping.""*

I’ve been a reporter for the Sturgeon Nexus for roughly 16 months, it’s been a wild internship that started with a young, dashing and sexually powerful cajun shrimp seller walking into the wrong room on their delivery and being showered with confetti, firm but wet handshakes and elongated smiles like those you see in awful hyper-realistic depictions of cartoon characters.

I remember the day they hired me, prepped with a welcome cake made of styrofoam and cream cheese, topped with tide pod decorations and a little sign affixed to the top, written in beautiful handwriting:

*“The forbidden treat for the new hire, don’t mind the burning sensation, that means it’s working..”*

I barely had time to register the situation before a firm hand slapped down on my shoulder and my bones rattled with the force. Perhaps the recipient was vibrating?

“O. F. PROVINCE YOU’RE FINALLY HIRED!” One jovial man exclaimed, his throat full of spiders when he spoke. Literally. A trapdoor spider sat itself by his uvula and clicked its feet as he got to the end of its sentence.

“We’re SO glad you’ve turned up, we were beginning to think you didn’t want the job!” A porcelain woman with a thick upper class accent and thicker upper class nostrils flared, her mouth not moving.

“I’ll need to pour some hot coffee on your belly to celebrate!” A third voice coming from the fifth panel down, four across on the ceiling. The others bristled as it spoke.

“Don’t… don’t worry about that. Our resources manager has a difficult living situation.” The first man said, patting me on the shoulder and leading me hurriedly out of the room.

That was that. I met with my editor, a tough old son of a bitch called Ekon that spoke in riddles or short bursts of passion. “Well, kid… took you long enough! We needed some fresh blood around here, ours is beginning to spoil!” He laughed and his teeth laughed with him, I smiled awkwardly. “Look, you’re our new investigative journalist. Whatever is going on in this town, I wanna know about it! Our readers are voracious, ravenous even…  and the helping of maximum beef jerky we give with every copy isn’t gonna placate ‘em forever… and we both know what happens when the readers get hungry…”

Of course I knew. Everyone in Sturgeon knew. The iridescent walkers descend on the office and a hostile takeover occurs. It’s become a bit of a macabre tradition that the more liberal types wanna stop, but it’s hard to break old habits.

“I uhh… I have a job I gotta be getting back to, that cajun shrimp won’t-“ He slapped his hand down on the table, rings tipped with swirling amorphous masses undulating at his touch. His eyes burned with indignation, but his cheekbones said passion.

“I like you, kid. The cajun n’ shrimp ‘em is done. I have some REALLY weird food you’re gonna wanna look into. I’ll pay you triple! Besides…” He moved some papers on his desk to reveal my resume, freshly made and with my relevant experience.

*All my relevant experience.*

“You’re looking for something and we’re the right place to be. Whaddya say? We in business? I can crack open a pulse thumper?” He smiled and his teeth smiled too, shuddering with anticipation. I nodded. If he knew what he says he knew, then… well, this was indeed the place to be.

What followed was an intense two weeks of training, clickbait manoeuvring, assistant rearing to stop them from biting and the Sturgeon Nexus code of conduct.

Now don’t worry, it’s not lengthy or arbitrary, but it’s worth mentioning. You never know how important these things are!

*“If a story has threads, pull on them even if they resist. You never know what may be lurking at the end of your proverbial rope.”*

*“Ask the hard questions, the soft questions, the medium rare questions and the questions your soul burns you to ask but your high brain is sloppily pleading you to stop between gross dry heaving.”*

*“Interviews are vital and a source cannot be trusted if you can’t speak to them. Dead, alive, incorporeal or so filled with a deadening rage that they can’t form consonants, it doesn’t matter. Get. That. Interview.”*

*“Lastly, remember The Sturgeon Nexus motto: The journey and the destination to truth are forever intertwined. Ad infinitum.'“*

So, after a few puff pieces on people like [The Mayor](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kvu4sk/i_was_just_told_the_three_words_you_never_want_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and his recruitment drive, [The Garbagemen That Come In The Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/laj5bs/why_did_the_garbagemen_start_coming_in_the_dead/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and most recently [The Iceberg Theory Incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m0dd5s/ive_found_an_iceberg_video_based_on_me_what_do_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I got my big break and the reason I’m here with you all today.

See, chief says that audience interaction is vital to figuring out the intricacies that I can’t see. Says that many, many eyes, mouths, flapping tongues and strained ears are better than one pair of dulled senses by the fumes. Chief is a bit strange, but I see his point. I want to talk to you all about The Sturgeon Farmers Collective®.

The SFC rose to prominence here during the turn of the century, offering to sell people suffering from the famine a cut of their crops and the means to help them grow their own for next to nothing on the price. They’d turn up in their flowing robes, faces hidden behind scarecrow bags and a great plow fastened to their backs.

“We will provide in your time of need. We will offer you sustenance to continue to the new season. You will repay in kind when the time comes. All good neighbours know of the kindness of The Sturgeon Farmers Collective.” They would say with that midwestern elderly charm breaking through their strange intonations. Standing there at the threshold, enhanced by the ugly light, holding out two bags; one with a rich and earthy red soil covered in small pulsing seeds that shimmered when held under lamplight.

The other bag was wet, squelchy, and smelled of cast iron. It twitched when the customers held it from the bottom, recoiling in on itself as The Sturgeon Farmers Collective made an audible **click** that subdued it.

“Do not mind the motions of food. All food at one time writhes and flaps and cascades meat from its pores. Eat the food before you plant the soil. Do not reverse the process. We will return when it is time.”

They would tip their tall Denton hats, a thick pungent slime oozing down the brim and staining the top of their hats. Almost like tears.

In the months that followed, the little settlement of Mantis Reach would begin to see changes.

Those who ate the food were told to do so under cover of darkness, so as not to offend Lady Death. Being a superstitious town in servitude to our fair lady, they did not disobey. They described it as tough, turgid, and one woman was quoted as saying; “I swear in the moments that I bit down, it said something…”

Then the insomniac movement came.

By sheer coincidence or otherwise, the townsfolk of Mantis Reach that ate the food as instructed would no longer sleep and instead dedicated themselves to the soil outside. People would be found with their faces firmly in the dirt, laughing as they inhaled earth and minerals, their chests heaving under the pressure and legs kicking frantically as they instinctively resisted.

Eventually, the crops would grow their bulbous sacks of delights and travellers would come to buy from the now largely unreachable inhabitants. But all would leave empty-handed.

The Sturgeon Farmers Collective returned and one settler who didn’t partake reported their arrival in the waning hours of dawn, each of them fanning out from the centre of the village to cover the major households. Their scarecrow sacks wafting in the breeze and showing grey flesh underneath.

When they arrived at the houses, hands outstretched, the patriarch and matriarch of each domicile would greet them with fistfuls of the harvest, tears in their eyes.

They would lead them to the backyard where the great stalks now stood, an occupant of the family meshed within its grip in ways that were too awful to describe.

“So the harvest can begin anew. A cycle of virtue and of sacrifice. A cycle we Farmers celebrate.” With poise, precision and an animalistic hunger, they cut the stalks to the ground and brought each synthetic sack of horrors back to the town centre as the heads of the families trailed behind them, still weeping.

There they would stack the harvest and the matriarchs would step forward, a sickle handed to each woman as she took her spot in line, trembling.

The patriarchs then dropped to their knees as those same writhing bags of food were placed in their hands. Their sweating, decadent hands.

“Eat and be merry. Your harvest reward: We are generous Farmers.” One would say, their voice of malaise and days gone by betraying their sinister gait and undulating Denton hat.

And so they did, eating with relish as heads disappeared in sacks to devour what lay inside. There was always a struggle, always a snapping and then a gnawing sound as the matriarch stepped forward to observe the process.

If they did not continue to writhe, the sickle was brought down, and they would fall silent.

But if they did resist… The Farmers Collective gained a new member.

As the fanfare died down and each Matriarch finished her job, all that was left was the harvest. The great bulbous sacks with the same oozing substance that came from The Farmers hats, something moving inside them.

The witness said it was a flash of hands, lip smacking sounds, squeezes and pops before The Farmers took their leave with the remaining harvest, vowing to come back when Mantis Reach was more prosperous.

A bizarre event, to be sure. One that still gets taught at St. Martin’s School to this day and is recalled by the Mantis Bay residents, [especially after the events last summer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gz5mtw/does_anyone_remember_a_tv_channel_called_beneath/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)that rocked the little town to its core.

“Not enough in the harvest for the last generation, that’s how you get bad eggs and dark shadows.” One resident who wished to be nameless and formless would remark under the cover of twilight. “Problems started showing up in ’92, right after the time of branches. Suddenly, no more offerings and no more growth, lot of our boys started goin' missing. One of them Farmers paid us a visit in the waning hours, told us that The Farmers had expanded and we would be observed, but not required… lot of troubles came after that.” They took a drag of their cigarette, bit down on whatever they were chewing on and spat something viscous onto the floor. “That there’s the only thing we got left now, our Mantis Bay special. Don’t ever let them tell you what it is. We don’t wanna know.”

My job as a reporter is to find the interesting stories and for every major event that’s happened in Sturgeon the past century, my paper focuses more on the incidents that get overlooked because of another calamity, nightmare dispute or something involving mass terror.

So when my source asks me if I wanna “catch me one of them Farmers for an exclusive”, my eyes light up and I feel my veins thicken.

“Ain’t too difficult, but also ain’t easy. Thing is, you gotta give ‘em something worth coming to you for. Especially since we’re not exactly in the boondocks, Sturgeon’s been here for nigh on 900 years, settlements included… and we’re pretty big. Old things like The Farmers Collective ain’t got the time to chase after everyone, y’know.” They shifted and their coat parted to show a burlap sack dripping wet that they unclasped and handed to me. Long fingernails with skin that looked as if it’d been wrapped in damaged parchment. “I ain’t gonna ask for much, but if you can find out how we get ‘em back to Mantis Reach while covering your story, you’d have my gratitude.”

“I can try, but why would you WANT them back if what we know is true? Aren’t you better off without them?” I twirled my number 15 pencil and let the taste of lead hang on my tongue as they studied me for a moment, long dirty nails scratching at their skin and pulling away dead flesh.

“Kid, when man gets too bold, he needs to be reigned in. You know why I never leave Sturgeon? Why, despite everything that happens here and what they KNOW, people won’t leave? It ain’t ‘cause they’re stupid, lemme tell ya.” They leaned in and I saw the yellow eyes, pupils dilating like that of a cat when it’s preparing to pounce. “They stay because there’s significant benefit being near something more powerful than you. It’s like nestling under the great wing of a beast that’ll crush everything else. You’d rather be the one spared than the one devoured… and soon, even when all the lights in Sturgeon go out, we’ll have **their** protection to be thankful for.”

There was a long pause, and I shifted in my seat, black spots punctuating my sight… too much lead?

“Still, beyond all that, we’re too used to the food. The Farmers Collective does something to it, we crave it. Sure, we can get it in smaller doses through their other businesses, but that raw garden… we need it…. Good luck.”

With that, they slunk back into the shadows and several hurried footsteps could be heard through the parking lot, small shapes flitting underneath lamplights as they darted off.

I called the chief up on my way back, a sign for Mantis Reach overhead.

“Chief, what would you say if I wanted to interview a member of The Farmers Collective?”

“I’d say do it on an empty stomach, keep your wits about you and remember the Nexus code.” He slurped something in the background, heavy gulps and a coughing fit as he licked his lips.

“That Hotels are too expensive and cops can’t be trusted with or without their many eyed enforcers?”

“That too, but no. “The journey and the destination to truth are forever intertwined"". Ad infinitum, Province.”

\-

I found the old houses where the first settlement in Mantis Reach began, a quaint little village called Echo Coast. Not many lived here now. The recession and subsequent drive to work in the main city had caused most to flee, their derelict log cabins and multi-connected yurts now all that remained of a once vibrant merchant town. Flyers for The Nightmare Fighting Tournament and The Dusklight Circus littered the ground, animals tearing at the remains as they spat words of vitriol to one another between bites and scratches.

It didn’t take long for one of the long-time residents to approach me, thick worn book under the arm and a pleasant but guarded greeting in their throat.

“Are you here to hear about our lord and saviour The All-Father?” She chimed, rehearsed words expelled from her lungs as if they didn’t belong to her for a moment, tired eyes sizing me up.

“I’m wondering if there’s a spot I can borrow for a night to conduct a meeting with one of the uh… Farmers.” I tried to hush my voice on the final part, but she simply bleated it back at me with the mere syllable passing my lips.

“The FARMERS? You do not SUMMON the farmers, they come when they wish… do you want to bring ruin and shame on this bustling town filled with vibrant souls looking to protect their kin and their livelihood?” She pulls the book closer to her chest and I can see red marks around her knuckles. “The All-Father says they’ll come back and they’ll bring prosperity with them as we feast eternally on ourselves… like an ouroboros… Yes, no more hunger…”

I tried to get more from her, but she simply pointed to a vacant yard and kept muttering “ouroboros” to herself as she paced back to her home.

In the window, I spotted an old man with milky white eyes staring out of the window, jaw slack and the muscles long since depleted. He was a vessel to observe, nothing more.

But I felt a chill run down my spine when I realised that somehow, someway, he was looking at me.

As I rounded the corner and found the backyard in utter disarray, I knew I’d found the right spot. Weeds sprouted up out of the thick black soil, huge white stalks pumping as they swayed in the breeze, insects of all manner proliferating around its base as they fed and killed and morphed.

Setting down the bag and waiting for the cover of darkness, I let my mind wander to what these people had been intimating. So much superstition, but nothing in this city was ever straight forward or normal, so why would now be any different? Maybe there’s some truth to it, something to investigate when this story is over…

The night passed overhead, and I dug a small hole in the ground, unfurled the bag and with some effort and resistance… poured it into the hole without looking. A small splash of meat hung on my finger, but the remainder dropped in as I hastily covered the hole with the black soil and waited.

I knew it would draw them out.

But, I admit, I was curious about the taste of this strange meat. A small piece of it clung to my finger, soft and warm, an alluring scent I could not place filled my nose as I bit down and tasted without thinking.

I can see why the townsfolk want the farmers back if it means producing more delights like this, it’s uncanny in flavour and texture. It’s more-ish and yet not. I think the only thing stopping me from digging up the contents and feasting was the sound of clothes being flapped in the breeze as a Farmer rounded the corner and greeted me.

“You have been busy.” Its voice was not at all the way I expected, sweet and salty instead of bristling and gravelly. It sounded the way peanut butter feels when being swallowed by the spoonful.

“I get around, it’s part of my job.” I didn’t want to appear meek. These things could smell fear. I also thought if I didn’t move that maybe they wouldn’t see me, but that seems to only work for very large badgers and moon dwellers.

They didn’t like my cavalier response and leaned down, gripping their burlap sack with thick gloves.

“You are curious, but The Farmers Collective does not need curious. We need compliance. You are not eating well…” The nails split through their gloves to pull at the folds of their masks. “You are looking through dead soil for answers that are long lost. The Farmers Collective has… expanded. We had to, ensuring we could cultivate for a far larger stock of workers.”

They pulled off their hood and for the first time in a long time I felt unmitigated terror flood my veins. My heart leapt and stuttered as my brain tried to comprehend the visual feast in front of me. It was wrong. It \*felt\* wrong to look at, but every time I tried to tear my eyes away, I salivated all the more. My body trembled while my stomach cried out for sustenance.

I felt something cold and coarse trickle down my throat as whatever resembled a mouth called out through the fog filling my ears and eyes.

“You have not been eating. You will need your strength for the answers. You are not unique soil, but you will bear special crops. We will harvest them when the time comes. The Farmers always reap for those who sow. We are your friends, providers, and we will protect our investments.”

My memory is hazy from this juncture, but my notes detail the Farmers putting their masks back on, promising me something, and then I fixated on the “racoons” around the area that were making their presence known. I wrote about “the harvest” repeatedly before my last word scratched so hard into my notepad that it broke my special pencil.

**“CORPORATE.”**

\-

I awoke face down with a mouth full of lactic acid and my teeth stained and shivering. Every muscle felt strained, and I was on my own as the sun began to transfer to the dusk shift. That woman from earlier stood outside her porch, book bound and tied to her chest and a flyer for The Dusklight Circus gripped with shaking hands as she stared at me, mouth agape.

“Every snake eats its own tail eventually and he shall choke on it upon realising he is too far gone to regurgitate!” She called, a shaking finger pointed out towards me, frayed hair flowing in the wind. “You will know this. You WILL know this.”

I tried to talk but my throat resisted at the mere attempt, I felt a lingering sense of being stalked as I stumbled back through this dead village to my car… maybe it was the “racoons”.

On the drive back I fought the maddening urge to pull over and eat silica gel packets with warm milk, bite down on a piece of drywall or chew the succulent juices from a laundry detergent pod. When trying to eat anything normal I felt the bile rise in my stomach and it treated it as if I were eating grass by the handful, angry at me for attempting to deviate from the cravings.

It was only after I gave in my report to the chief and had some of the welcoming cake that I began to feel normal. The zesty lemon and raspberry of the cake tide pods making my stomach growl with glee.

I’m glad I didn’t do further digging until after my digestion, though.

See, before I got assigned my next lead, I decided to look into The Sturgeon Farmers Collective history. My new staff would tell me very little aside from “it’s how it’s always been, can’t do much now and NOBODY wants to eat raw, right?” All of them said no matter what “hot scoop” the resources manager in the ceiling had, it wasn’t worth hearing them out.

So, off to the archives I went, hoping to find some extra info on their history.

And I sure did find it.

***June 8th, 1905:*** *Sturgeon Farmers Collective forms Recruitment Drive. The desire to create more jobs and begin a corporate change for a new era is behind the move, says a spokesman for The Farmers.*

***September 13th, 1938:*** *Factory worker revolt leads to several accidents, former workers claim “there’s something in the food”. Sturgeon Farmers Collective refuses comment.*

***September 15th, 1938:*** *Mass fire breaks out in Sturgeon Docks, multiple buildings destroyed and many feared dead. Witnesses claim they heard screams separate and more dissonant than that of the workers.*

***April 30th, 1976:*** *Multiple deaths seemingly linked despite no clear motive after several Sturgeon residents convulse after trying a newly branded cereal by Sturgeon Farmers Collective. Medical results are sealed, and the cereal has been pulled. The only comment offered by the Sturgeon Farmers was simply; “It wasn’t ready.”*

***August 23rd, 1992:*** *Sturgeon Farmers Collective now oversees and operates a staggering 88% of all the food cultivation and production in Sturgeon, employing a third of the city's eligible workforce. They have diversified from a crop growing/gathering union into a fully realised industry that sells everything from meats to rice and candy. Echo Coast ceases its agreement with The Sturgeon Farmers Collective, cites problems with production and an inability to keep up demand. All healthy male workers are invited to a personal ""recruitment drive"" at the SFC headquarters.*

***May 7th, 2001:*** *Lethargy, insomnia and desire to go hiking to high spots seeing massive spike in the current generation.

**“CORPORATE.”**

They were finding ways to diversify their food stock and ensure there would be enough for a growing population. They were making sure we would be well fed, no matter the cost.

I retch and feel the contents of my stomach spill out over the archives. Grey, bubbling and piping hot as it burns my lips and cakes the floor.

Something big lodges in my throat and it takes everything I have to force it out, eventually prying a piece of it with my fingers from behind my tongue and pulling no matter how much my eyes watered and my ears screeched in protest.

My legs go weak and I fear I won’t be successful before I pass out, but one final wrench sets it free, and it splashes into the putrid mix beneath me as I sit back down and groan.

When I look at what had made a home in my stomach, I hastily grab a napkin and scoop it up, dizzily excusing myself and apologising for the mess. They cannot see what this was, I don’t know if THEY know, but the chance can’t be taken.

I think it best that I start following up on other leads, now. The Farmers have made it clear that it would be unwise to do so. Maybe i'll have more to come back to you with soon, but this particular thread should no longer be tugged on. Not after what I've seen.

I stare at it on my desk, heart pulsing in my chest and tongue flapping around in my mouth like a fish as it struggles to relax, anxious that something STILL lurks in my throat. I feel sick; I feel hungry… I feel fear. You have to understand; I HAD to burn it. If they know I don’t have this anymore…

A small humanoid shape was within the mixture. Brown hair, green eyes, a small scar on their upper lip that looked too similar to my own to be coincidence.

I don’t trust The Sturgeon Farmers Collective.

Especially now they’ve gone corporate.

mbfg2c,17,2021-03-23,27 yo with a Master’s degree | 2 years of job search with hundreds of applications = 1 interview,CthrowawayV,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mbfg2c/27_yo_with_a_masters_degree_2_years_of_job_search/,"Dear r/jobs

As the title says, I have a Master’s degree (Biology-related STEM degree). I have graduated in May 2019 and had been looking for a Ph.D. for more than a year. After realizing that it is not gonna happen anytime soon, I’ve decided to apply for research assistant and technician positions in labs. Again it’s been more than a year… I have changed my CV/resume and cover letter more than 5 times throughout my applications and even though I came a long way from my 5-page long CV that had a picture of me and my 2-page long cover letter (yeah… I know) about two months ago I have realized that I still don’t know a lot of things about resumes. Just to give an example, I’ve learned about ATS just about 2 months ago.

Since then, I’ve been reading and reading and reading different job forums, Reddit, a lot of books, Ask a manager, and so on because I don’t wanna miss anything that might affect my chances of getting recruited. \[Insert venting\] I am 27 and living with my parents for the last 2 years without earning a reasonable amount of money… I think they see how hard I try every single day to apply for numerous jobs in different places. For my Master’s thesis, I’ve worked until night numerous times, worked during weekends, and even slept in the office 2 times… I feel like I’ve wasted more than 4 years of my life (including the time for the Master’s degree) and I don’t even know what to do anymore \[end of venting\].

I am aware of the length of this post but I have no one to ask these things. Every time I changed my resume/CV I expected to be invited for interviews and get a job so I kept applying for months before realizing that I had to write a better resume. That's one of the reasons why it is taking me more than 2 years. I don't wanna waste time anymore hence the length of the post. I have categorized them according to their priority -for me- and I’ll really appreciate it if you can take your time to answer them.

&amp;#x200B;

**-High Priority-**

&amp;#x200B;

* Applying late

I’ve read somewhere that the recruiters may stop looking at the resumes after they invite a handful of people. If that’s true, it means my chances had always been almost zero because I have always been applying on the day of the deadline which was at least a month after the publication of the ad. So, does it matter if I apply a week or a month after the publication of the ad even if the deadline is far future?

&amp;#x200B;

* ATS

Please stop rolling your eyes. There is a lot of different and often conflicting information out there written by job searchers, resume writers, and hiring managers. As far as I understood, all the resumes pass the ATS as long as the applicants have all the required qualifications. However, does the ATS rank or at least change the order of the resumes according to the number of the keywords mentioned on the resumes? Connected to the previous point, if the recruiters invite only a handful of people, even just changing the order of the resumes without ranking can affect applications. In other words, what are the chances of a resume to be seen (or seen early) by the recruiters if the keywords are written 5 times, 3 times, or only one time? If it doesn’t change or affect anything, why do you use ATS?

&amp;#x200B;

* Can I repeat the keywords in every section of my work experience?

For example, PCR is one of the most basic and often asked technical skills. If PCR is mentioned in the requirements or desired section, can I write “Cloned \[gene X\] by using PCR…”, “Determined the gene expression change by using RT-qPCR…”, and so on (i.e. different sentences and examples) under different employment sections? Including the internships, I have about 4 sections in the work experience part and I feel that it may sound redundant to repeat the same technique 4 times but at the same time, it might show that I have a lot of experience using the technique.

&amp;#x200B;

* Bold keywords

Since recruiters look for keywords and they just skim the resume, I’ve been thinking of highlighting my keywords to get the attention of the recruiter and make it easy for them to skim my resume. Does it make sense or is it a no-no?

&amp;#x200B;

* Tailoring resume

Apart from mentioning the keywords in the job ad, how can I tailor my resume for a specific position/ad? Also, I don’t know what people mean by “culture of the company”. Does that really mean anything or is it used as an excuse to eliminate some candidates? Another thing is the “mission” or “values” of the company/university. If I write some of those words people would scold me for sounding boring, using cliches, and writing subjective things.

&amp;#x200B;

* To relocate

I have seen a lot of times that the ATS or recruiters could discard a resume without looking any further if the candidate writes a different state and I am in a different country… Is there anything I can do about it? For example, I had been to the US (J-1 visa). Would it help if I just write “J-1 visa” right next to my internship while applying for the jobs in the US? Also, I want to learn the reason why the hiring managers dismiss the resumes coming from other states and countries so that I can address the issues in my resume and cover letter.

&amp;#x200B;

* How can I integrate the praises I’ve received into my resume?

Naturally, some of them were verbal and I am not sure if it is okay to include them because practically I have no proof. But some of them were written. For example: “\[OP\] completed the assigned experimental work in an outstanding manner. \[…\] immediately highly motivated and finished this in the same way!” I think you can understand why I want to use quotes in my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Normal Priority-**

&amp;#x200B;

* How can I integrate soft skills into my resume?

I certainly don’t want to write self-motivated and leave it at that. But I feel like I would waste space if I write “Self-motivated: Worked independently for project X. Communication skills: Presented results in lab and institute meetings”.

&amp;#x200B;

* Filling work experience boxes after uploading a resume

As you most likely already know, most of the time the recruiters ask to fill profile, education, and work experience even though the resumes are uploaded to the system. I have no idea if I should just copy and paste the content of my work experience (to the respective sections of course) or write different bullet points.

&amp;#x200B;

* Name change

I have an ethnic name that is not difficult to read or write but still unusual. I have seen a couple of times people changing their names to “Bob” and “James” and they start to get significantly more invitations to interviews. It is not like all the recruiters and hiring managers are racists, don't want to hire Asians or African Americans… So, why is that the issue? I want to learn because I want to address the issues that might come with an unusual name. Also, do you know if this is the case in academia as well?

&amp;#x200B;

* Changing previous job titles to suit the job title of the application

I’ve seen some people writing their internships as “Student researcher” or “Research assistant” to fit the ad. Can I change the title of my internships?

&amp;#x200B;

* Jokes or hobbies to stand out

Some people mentioned they were invited (or inviting if they are recruiters) because they wrote “cook a minute rice in 58 seconds” or because they had interesting hobbies like wrestling. Does it really work? By the way, I can come up with original jokes so I won’t write cliche on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

* Repeating resume on cover letter

I understood that I should address the keywords mentioned in the ad. But if I do that both in my resume and cover letter, the letter would be just a repetition of the resume. How can I avoid that?

&amp;#x200B;

* Salutation and signature on cover letter

I am afraid to address the wrong person in my cover letter. Is it okay if I address my letter to the owner of the lab whom I’ll work for if I get hired? Also, do I need to sign cover letters?

&amp;#x200B;

* Do these work?

I’ve read that information interviews can help networking which in turn can help recruitment. Also, I’ve read about pain letters that **should be sent by snail mail (??)** Do they really work? I thought of starting a blog to “share my expertise” so that the recruiters can notice my blog or at least be aware that I am knowledgeable in my area. Would it help with my application?

&amp;#x200B;

**Thank you so much for reading the whole thing or a part of it. It would make me really happy if you can address even one of the points I've mentioned in the post. Thank you in advance.**"
mbfy1x,6,2021-03-23,US MSF Experiences,sabersbucks12,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mbfy1x/us_msf_experiences/,"Hi,

I regularly see the MSF degree discussed on here, but often from the standpoint of an undergrad finance student looking to further their education/get another stab at recruiting. 

I am a young professional (0-2 years experience) from an unrelated field looking to pivot into finance and am curious to hear the experiences of current/former MSF students who entered their programs from a similar angle.

The thought of a one year program is a bit unnerving as I would be spit into the job hunt without internship experience, but looking at these programs’ websites, the employment statistics are consistently impressive (my standards may be different from many here as I am interested in corpfin). They seem to take a large percentage of non-finance students and place them into finance jobs each year.

Anyways, if anyone here can share their experience to calm or justify my skepticism, it would be tremendously appreciated. For a bit more background, the programs I would be applying to are Big Ten type schools. 

Thanks."

Situation:

* Graduated December 2020 with a BS in mathematics from a large public state school
   * 2.9 GPA, no internships
   * Took a few CS courses in college, but didn't get to DS+A
* Started learning through making my own projects at the beginning of this year
   * Built a front end only React app
      * Makes REST GET requests to a government database, displays results for the user and lets them compare different items
      * Used regexes for input validation
      * Responsive design for mobile/desktop made completely from scratch, including the design/CSS
   * Built a full stack Kanban Board using the MERNG stack
      * Users can register, login, create, edit, delete and move tasks
      * authentication and authorization (I basically copied this as I didn't feel comfortable enough making my own security from scratch)
      * Otherwise, built from scratch including design/CSS
   * Made a portfolio website in HTML/CSS
      * created a custom design with assets made in Adobe Illustrator
   * Currently working on learning Python and some concepts like networking/sockets by messing around with port scanning, and webscraping with Beautiful Soup
* All of these are more or less ready to go, I just need to get them hosted - which I've not yet done as I didn't want to until I begin applying for jobs.

So, I feel anxious because I've never studied data structures/algorithms. I know some basics - one of my college courses was in C and we built doubly linked lists but that's probably the most advanced I know. I wish I had tried harder in school, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do at the time and only discovered how much I love learning programming after just diving in on my own. I absolutely love learning different technologies and coming up with projects to learn them. I have ADHD and I've found just jumping into a project works really well for me - but that also traditional studying doesn't really suit me, so I'm currently struggling to find a way of learning DS+A that does work for me.

Should I begin applying to jobs despite my lack of DS+A experience? I don't mind taking another few months to really cement DS+A, but I feel I should probably focus on that or applying to jobs instead of just building a long list of projects. Any advice for learning DS+A through a project approach or is textbook/practicing leetcode (or other such sites) really just the way to go?  

Is there anything else I should focus on besides DS+A? Such as additional tech/frameworks or if what I've practiced so far enough of a start? Any other general advice is always welcome, too!

Thanks for reading!"

Me (29F) and my fiance (31M) are getting married in Nov 2022, so there is a long time before the wedding. We are paying for the wedding ourselves, so we are splitting the costs.

My fiance finished his MBA last December and I will be finishing school Dec 2021. We live nowhere near the cities in issue.

My fiance found a great job opportunity in Atlanta, where most of his family reside. This is an awesome job in a company with offices worldwide. I am beyond excited for him! He is to start his job this summer/fall. His company has some policies where he won't be able to transfer to another office before working there for a year.

I have an internship opportunity this summer that could potentially lead to a job offer. This internship will not be held in Atlanta. I have been told that supposedly if offered full time employment afterwards, I could pick location preferences and they'll try to accomodate me. I would probably have a start date for Winter/Spring 2022. This company has offices in Atlanta, as well as the city I'd like to work at, Chicago. This company also has policies where I won't be able to transfer before a year as an employee.

We would love to eventually settle down in Chicago. This is something we have definitely talked about. Even though he is super grateful for this job opportunity, he doesn't really love the fact that he is going to be living in Atlanta (nothing against ATL, its just not what we envisioned). I have no problem being in Atlanta for a period of time, I worry that it might be more difficult for both of us to transfer cities, than for only one of us. Both of our jobs are stronger in Chicago. But at the same time, we would probably be long distance for a whole year if I were to move to Chicago.

We have spoken about this, and we are leaning to me going for Chicago and then him transfering but I am worried it would add an unnecessary strain to the relationship. 

If offered full-time, should I pick Chicago since it would be what both of us want as some point? Or should I pick Atlanta and make it easier on our relationship? Is a year too long of a period on long distance? What would you do?"

To explain my current situation, I am currently in the 2nd year of undergrad school at Bocconi. Unfortunately, I went through a dark place in the second half of last year triggered by Covid and family reasons.   
Thank god, I am doing a lot better now. I was also able to put my frustration into my academic performance which has pushed my GPA massively the last two semesters.   
However, since I basically did nothing ""important"" career-wise (spent a lot of time thinking about myself) last Autumn/Winter, I missed all applications for a summer internship. I really fucked it. In retrospect I do not even know what I thought, I just didn't think probably  
During the last month, I tried everything to get into a finance-related role unfortunately without luck. Locally, recruiters from smaller firms have told me that due to Covid the number of spots is much smaller, and thus the competition higher. (MSc and PhD students applying for the same roles)

Therefore, I wanted to ask you all for advice on what to do, as I still have absolutely no relevant work experience (just a 6-month military service stint which is not really relevant) and the thought of graduating without work experience kind of scares me.

I am still applying, but I am thinking that If I do not get an internship this summer, I should do programing (always wanted to get better at it) and finance (modeling, etc...) courses/certificates. I really do not want to let this summer go to waste, because my chances for breaking in straight out of undergrad without experience seem rather grim.

&amp;#x200B;

Also some other questions I have: 

* When you do not get a reply 3 weeks after passing the online assessments, it probably means you are not in the selection process anymore right? 
* Do banks accept applications for summer internships for 3rd-year students?
* If I really graduate without experience could I have bigger chances at off-cycle internships?
* When trying to network, is it normal for people at the place you are applying to, to rarely accept your requests?

I would be really grateful for some advice regarding how to plan from now on. My absolute dream would be to break into S&amp;T, followed by IB. 

Thank you all in advance  
Also, Thank you all for contributing to this forum, I am using it daily and it is an extremely helpful resource for students to understand the processes of the industry."

I have another company to hear back from and a couple more interviews in the works but it all just feels so hopeless now. If I didn't get that job then why would any of these other jobs take me? I love CS and work hard at it but it feels like it's just not for me anymore. I have bad anxiety and mild depression and this is all making it quite a bit worse. And the fact that all it takes is an unsuccessful job search to make me feel so dejected when I have so much to be thankful for makes me feel even more like a waste of life.

Pretty much leaving me to do the work of all those that left. On top of it all, the amount work has increased given that clients have asked us to do more things for them during COVID. Pretty much duplicating the work that I was already doing for the people that left.

I've also had to train someone that had 0 experience in the field and we will be hiring an intern in the next few months, guess who's gonna have to train this person...? To top it all off, I have been doing things that have never been done with my clients and showing record-breaking results that have been escalated to people with executives roles in our company and the client's side.

A few months ago I told my boss all of the above and I told him that if I can't get a promotion I'd at least want to get a salary increase. He said that unfortunately promotions won't be happening until April but he will see what he can do about salary increase.

He came back to me last week with a salary increase that I wasn't so happy about but I said fine, it's better than nothing. However, a few weeks ago someone got moved from my team (same team but he/she does a different role and works with different tools) because in the last 3-5 months there hasn't been a lot of work on their end and just yesterday got a promotion.

My motivation just plummeted because how is it that someone who got moved to another team because there was no work gets a promotion and here I am really working my butt off and showing record breaking results and all I get is just a few bucks increase in my salary?

I really don't know how to approach this. I'm not thinking about quitting right now or anything but what I am thinking is to start looking for other companies.

What should I do? What is happening right now?"

I already have a part-time job in my current field so I'm not looking to quit. I only want a summer internship since I'm still in university and will be graduating next year (May 2022). I'm thinking about completely dropping the part time position if all goes well with one specific internship I applied for.

I'm really introverted and interviews make me so anxious. 

There was one internship that I managed to interview for yesterday. 

My answer to the first question was worded a bit awkwardly and ended a bit awkwardly as well, in my opinion. 

Then came the 2nd question where I felt like I shined more because I spoke about my experience. The lady I spoke to seemed impressed with my experience and sounded very positive.

She then told me what the internship is about, if i get accepted, how i'll be getting paid, how I'll be sent a work laptop (if i get accepted), and basically a bit of background of the department I'll be an intern for.

It's a full-time paid internship and I told her I'd be more than okay with working a full-time since I won't be taking any classes in the summer. She told me ""oh! that's great!"" 

So basically, I got an email from her saying that she sent my application to some higher-ups for review and I'll be hearing back about my status in the 2nd week of April. 

Later today, I also interviewed for an unpaid internship at around 12pm. Because I'm waiting for a reply from the previous internship, I told this lady that if I do get accepted for this unpaid internship, I'd need two weeks so I can quit my current job (a lie. my current job gives me little hours so I'm not looking to quit. I just want something for the summer). She said it was fine.

I got an email from the unpaid internship around 4-5pm saying I got accepted, which shocked me because I figured it'd take longer. I was told ""I understand you need to quit your current job to focus on this one so we'll be giving you 2 weeks to prep. April 12th will be the starting date should you accept."" 

I was shocked! Is this normal?

I don't know what to do... I want to accept it incase I don't get accepted for the paid internship... But I don't know if I should just go along with it and dip or what?

Here is the fifty-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

So, to make use of the extra time I'd have during this year I started looking for a job and landed an internship at a unicorn and the plan was to drop it when the contract ends and move away for my masters in the summer.

Well, long story short, this internship has been amazing, an amazing opportunity career wise and I've been offered a position to permanently stay after it ends in mid-April and I just can't make my mind up about what to do.

The technology is interesting, it's a somewhat well reputed company that compensates well (those last two points talking in comparison in respect to my home country) and I absolutely love my team which is probably the main cause of doubts.

I feel kind of ridiculous even considering not taking the offer, however I've wanted to study abroad since a long time ago and I'm really torn apart what to do here. I'm scared it may be something completely different of what I'm imagining, don't know how covid will affect that experience and am unsure if I'm making a huge mistake in my career by not taking this opportunity.

I'm kinda desperate since I have to give an answear by the end of March and was wondering if you have any suggestions, opinions or some point of views I may be missing when thinking about this"

I graduated in May 2019 with degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with no relevant jobs or prospects lined up. To be honest, it just wasn't a priority for me at the time because of health issues in the family which affected my mental health pretty severely, and then covid coming along to make things worse. 

I'm now in a much better spot and feel ready to begin my career, but am feeling overwhelmed beginning the job hunt. I don't have any internship experience and the only other work experience I have is in a family business with no relevance to software development. 

Also, I feel as if I really don't know what makes a desirable candidate. I have decent Java/C/C++ programming skills, but know next to nothing about highly used frameworks in the job market right now. All of my class and personal projects have been completed using one of the above languages and most were either command line applications or filling in/fixing smaller parts of a bigger project. Basically, I feel pretty out of depth about what makes someone useful in a software development team and what the actual work is like and have no idea where to look for that information. 

I've been doing lots of hackerrank/leetcode questions, but feel like these have little to do with actual productivity on a job and don't really teach how to make cool/useful things. 

In summary, I feel like I have decent fundamentals, but no real world skills. Also, I don't know what those skills are either. I can troubleshoot bugs in logic and track down syntax/compiler errors, but it doesn't seem like anyone is really looking for ""just"" a Java developer. I would appreciate any suggestions you guys have to build experience beyond simple programming exercises and doing some real work that someone will find useful.

Thanks for your advice!"

I'm a Computer engineering student from Chile. I graduated on January but the university degrees are a bit weird here. After 4 years I got a Bachelor of Science, but in order to be a Computer Engineer I have to do an extra year. First semester (March - June) is only university courses while the second semester (July - December) must be an internship in a company 5 years or older and with at least 20 employees and no direct relationship (father is the boss, etc.) within it.

I wanted to do my internship abroad, hopefully in Europe or North America but. Since January I've applied to around 23 companies, of which 10 have responded with a rejection and the other 13 have either not responded or the process is still open.

I don't know if it's because my resume is bad or because I have founded 2 startups and maybe there's a problem with that or because I don't have a working visa or just COVID messing up my chances but at this point, is it worth to keep applying for internships for my second semester (July - December)?

Got off the phone with a advisor recently for a bootcamp program, as I've had little luck with finding a job and think it would be good for the career resources and sprucing up my programming skills, but albeit I am not so sure throwing money at the problem will really find me success, I am thinking it would probably be more beneficial and less costly if I just put together a portfolio of projects related to what I want to do. 

The biggest problem is that I have troubles being self motivated (plus have NO idea what to do for a project so I am never to sure where to start), I feel since I was in a course just recently that I do really well when I have assignments and deadlines but when it's all on my own I tend to slack off constantly.

Anybody have experience with bootcamps that can tell me their opinion of them? The one i'm doing is through my university (University of Washington) but I was told by the advisor that the program is managed through Trilogy Education Services, any advice would be great."

I’m so heartbroken and I just wish (as bad as this sounds) I could just die at this point (sorry for the trigger) or just fade away somewhere and I really don’t know what to do. I regret saying that, it’s bad to think about dying or anything like that in my religion but I just never feel good enough anymore and I’m so insecure and I just hate what’s happening. I just feel so alone and that’s why I’m deciding to make this post but I can’t even find the words to explain any of it. I messed up really badly in my first and second year, I dropped all of my courses, had so many LWD’s, failed so many courses and now I just feel like those mistakes are gonna dictate the rest of my life. I developed really bad anxiety the summer after grade 12, I was bullied really badly by my cousin (same age as me) and so much went wrong with that but I don’t want to get into the details here. I tried sharing this with my parents but they thought I was lying and because mental health doesn’t exist in my family, I never really shared any of my struggles with them. They think I’m fine, flowing through life. I’m so disgusted by my transcript and myself really like nobody gets it. I’ve sent hundreds of applications out since October and I can’t even land a single interview. Not even that but I don’t know what’s going on, even something like showering seems like such a shire and I love or loved long I’ve started cold emailing recruiters and I’m just so confused how I let any of this happen. I don’t even have a LinkedIn, it gives me so much anxiety and I don’t even know what to put down when I make one, I’m in my third year without being in a program and I’m just a failure... so many people my age have internships at google, Microsoft, a big bank and I’m just so useless. My cousin, who was so mean landed his dream internship and his dad came over with cake to share the good news. My parents were so pretend happy for him and the dad who’s clearly so humble and decided to bring cake during a pandemic to share the good news but when he left I could sense the disappointment from them, my mom went on and on about how I’m such a failure and how she regrets that I’m her child instead of that cousin. My dad even stopped talking to me and I just don’t know what to say. I haven’t told them about my job search because I don’t want to until I know but it’s so hard seeing someone get everything you’ve ever wanted. In terms of school, my family life is difficult, my parents are always fighting and even with my door closed I can hear them and a lot of their conversations are about me, how I’m useless, good for nothing, etc. It’s so difficult to concentrate on school when there’s so much background noise but I’m trying. I’m taking a fifth year because of the failure from first and second, but I’m so afraid to tell them because I just know it’s gonna disappoint them even more. 
Tbh, I don’t even know what I’m doing with school... I applied to life sciences thinking I was gonna do radiation therapy, but I dropped physics 2 times. I took CSC108 in second year and really enjoyed it but my grandpa passed away in the middle of the year so I gave up because my anxiety got really and I ended up CR’ing the course because the change in marking scheme from the pandemic really helped me somehow pass. I really enjoyed the beginning of 108 and thought since CS is so hyped and seems like a great field, maybe I can try 148 and 165 so I enrolled in them this term but I struggled with keeping up (and taking a full course load for the first time) that I decided I had to drop them for now and take them in the summer. Even if I take 148 and 165 now, there’s no way I could do the major because I just can’t afford the deregulated fees, realistically. I’ve decided to try a cognitive science major + stats and computer science minors. I think the CS minor is easier with POST and then I don’t have all the worries about fees. I just can’t figure out how to plan the third year courses, you can only take 3 and with a cogsci major you have to take either 384 or 311 and I don’t know how useful either of those are. I just want to learn plain programming with python which I don’t really know. There’s this dream internship I want to apply to not this year but next, but my transcript literally has me in tears, how do I be a competitive applicant when I’ve been so garbage up until now. My family hates me, I have no friends and I really want to prove myself for myself because I deserve it but I don’t know where to start. I’ve applied to so many internships that I think I’d be sort of a good fit for based on their description, RBC, Wiley, TD, small companies like law firms, research stuff, literally anything with no luck. I really want my dreams to come true but I don’t know where to start. I really want to make changes, I turn 21 in a few months and I don’t want to keep living in denial... I’m so tired of it. I’m sorry for rambling, there’s so much more to this but I think saying this much has been therapeutic enough for now. I don’t really know the purpose behind this post, maybe comparing my transcript to others will help? Maybe I just want to hear someone say it’ll be okay even though it feels like it won’t and maybe someone was in a similar experience and able to turn it around, idk.

I am a Molecular biologist. I had my Master's degree in a research institute in Germany. My work was excellent. So, my supervisor asked me to stay for the same project for my Ph.D. research. In total, I've worked for 4 years in that research laboratory. However, at the end of the 4th year, I had a major depression due to work (too much workload, mobbing, animal experiments) and personal problems (I had a divorce). I had a doctor's report that proves my clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I left work with that report. During this time my supervisor was mobbing me to quit. For my mental health, I took two weeks off (doctor's advice). While I was gone, he spread the word I have problems/depression and might quit. When I was back from my leave, random people in our institute were coming and asking me ""how I am? if I am alright.."". that was the last impact on my health and I quit with the doctor's report.

Since then I didn't contact them. I moved out of the city.

Now 2 years later of what happened, in 2020, they published a paper in a scientific journal. The project that I worked on for 4 years was published by my colleague as a first author and my intern as the second. My supervisor was of course the last author. They didn't use the data that I analyzed. Although I am not sure about it. But that entire project was my baby and I did all the work and proved the concept. And what's left was, they just reproduced the data.

And my name is not even mentioned and I am not any of the authors.

Since I left work, I always thought it was unfair what happened to me and I should speak up. And this paper was the last drop.

What should I do? Do I have any legal ground? How should I proceed?

I should emphasize that I am not a German. My supervisor and all my colleagues were. I am coming from another country (non-European) and I couldn't speak German very well while I was working in that laboratory. So I was highly unaware of European and German laws.

I would be very happy not only with advice but someone who can direct me to a lawyer who has experience with workers law in academia and who is familiar with European law.

I look forward to hearing your ideas!"

I just graduated from college in December and 2020 was the year that broke me – as it did with a lot of people. 

To give some context, I was a Graphic Design student and during the last two semesters for our Capstone, you redesign old work to put into a portfolio, research and design a topic you’d like to look into, and search for jobs. However, my semesters were cut short due to COVID. Everything changed with how my Capstone would be. We went from designing an experience in a museum setting to just being online completely. 

At the start of March 2020, most design firms put out an 18 month hiring freeze. This wasn’t such a big deal for me since I already had a job working in retail, especially since I was making a nice amount hourly (around $15/hr). None of my classmates or I could get an interview, let alone an internship. During what would normally be a time of mingling and meeting design firms looking for new hires, we sat on Zoom watching the engagement of our pages increase. 

So here’s where my problem starts: there are a few places starting to open up with hiring designers. Some of my family member and close friends have actually given me some great leads and hard to pass up jobs but I am so terrified of applying to them. I feel as though I’m not ready to jump into my field of work. 

I love my retail job but most people are expecting me to leave it because it’s not what I went to school for. I’m scared that if I leave my current job I won’t be making as much and I’m not as good as a designer as others. I get stuck on these two problems a lot and I don’t really have people to talk to who won’t invalidate my fears with “well welcome to the real world” or “welcome to adulthood.”

I have never been so confused and uncertain before so anything will help."

mc0qoa,2,2021-03-24,My mom keeps saying NO &amp; putting negative thoughts in my head,Define_Sunshine,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/mc0qoa/my_mom_keeps_saying_no_putting_negative_thoughts/,"I will keep this short and brief.

So when I first wanted to go to college back in 2014 my parents were still together. It was mainly my mom who kept telling me know that I shouldn’t apply and go to a college that’s 2 hours away from the house and that I should go to the college located 30 minutes from our house in downtown Denver. I really wanted to get that “college experience” that’s why I wanted to leave the house. After multiple arguments and her being stubborn and not trying to understand my side I gave that idea up and decided to go to the downtown college just to please her.

*Fast forward to me now 25*

I am graduating this May from college which I’m so excited about. It feels like it took me so long to get my degree but I’m very happy that I I am only two months away from graduating! During my undergrad semesters I would consistently travel to different places. I thought that by me being able to travel I would at least get an idea of where I wanted to move after I finished college. For the longest time I wanted to live in the East Coast but after several visits I realized that wasn’t my pace. So now I am set on moving to Chicago. 

So basically my friend is it in her little sister in Chicago and I get a call this week. My friend tells me that her little sister got an internship in California therefore she would be leaving Chicago June 1 and that I could take her room. Not to mention since I will also have other roommates basically rent would be about 475 every month and I would only be 20 minutes north from the city. I didn’t even think twice and I told my friend to tell her sister that I would be more than happy to take over! Being excited as I was I wanted to share the news with my mom. 

Although I get that now since her and my dad have divorced she just always feels scared at the idea of her children being so far away from her. My older sister lives in Colorado also but she’s only 20 minutes from my mom so I would be the first in the family to move completely away from her. So I told my mom about how I found a place and I’m gonna go check it out next week she immediately gets upset. She’s so against the idea of me moving anywhere away from here. I mention any state to her other than Colorado she’s always telling me NO and then I’m not gonna move and basically just being so negative. So I finally had enough of her crap the other day and I semi went off on her. I told her that she never has anything good to say and that rather than encouraging your kids to chase their dreams you wanna put fear in their hearts and make it seem like it’s a bad thing to want change. She tells me that the next day she had a “vision” in her dream that something bad happened to me while I was out there. She also said that she contacted my older sister to talk me out of me moving cause she refuses to let me go. Like wtf? 

I’m not happy here in Denver I want to fucken leave. I don’t think I can take this place any more I need a breath of fresh air. New adventures new scene new everything."

I currently have an unfinished project + many exciting future plans (I'm working on it for about 8 months).

So I just had an interview for a two month internship that could lead to employment in an IT sector of a financial company. One of the board members asked me to write and send a cover letter to answer the question in the title and to write a paragraph about why I am the right fit for the company. 



From my understanding, they are a growing company and plan to expand to different countries and develop new technologies and automation. This suits me because I am a fresh college graduate and would like to work in a position where I can gain experience and develop new skills. Do I say that I see myself specifically at that company or just write generally? How do I go about answering these questions?


Thank you!"

I'll be graduating soon with a degree in CS from UW Madison and I have an internship currently where I work as a Salesforce Dev. I know that I'm going to get an offer to work full-time after graduating in a few weeks, which is very exciting. However, one of my friends who is also working at the same company was hired on at the end of last fall and is making $40,000 as his salary, and I'm assuming that my offer will be similar. 

Is $40,000 for a position like this too little, even though it's my first job out of college? What would the minimum be that I should accept? Or is this a situation where it's viable to just 'jump ship' in a year and hop to another job?

For additional context, I'm only an ok student. I've been hovering around a 3.0 GPA for the past 4 years and I don't do incredibly well during interviews (I tend to mix up what I want to say when I get nervous, so technical and personal questions can be a struggle during applications), so I'd like to stay here if possible, if only for a little while.

Im in Houston TX and also in school for computer science as I want to be a software engineer long-term. After this semester I should be, ""qualified"" enough to apply for internships in the fall.

I received a job offer to be a jr. Loan officer and I would be assisting the senior loan officer refinance his clients and help with the leads for the branch. The base is $5 an hour less, commute is 45 - 60 minutes from my house and with commissions he expects for me to make $60-$70k a year. The benefits are pretty standard except my military time away isn’t paid.

In my current role, I’m a consumer loan specialist at one main financial and my primary job responsibilities are to collect payments, sell optional insurance products and sell/refinance loans. This job I can make $50-$60k and it's only 15 minutes away from my house. I've been able to dedicate 2 hours a day to studying and it has really good benefits. For ex, I’m in the national guard and all my military time away is paid, etc. If I leave, I have to pay $1,500 back in sign on bonus. 

And at the end of the day, I'd still be looking to leave to become a software engineer at a years time frame.

Is it worth leaving my current role for the possibility of making more money?"

I have been there for 5 years now. 2 months ago I was approached and asked if I would like to be a project manager, I said yes, and then they came back the next month and said I have it.  They also asked me if I would like to cover for our customer relations/sales person position this summer when he goes on leave for about 3 months, which I also agreed to but wanted to know what my compensation would be, aka salary increase.  I also run the summer internship program at our company, basically hire and mentor new interns all summer.

So I asked them for the salary details, job description, training schedule, when do I officially start the position, etc.  Multiple times.  I have basically been given excuses about they need to get details together, etc.

Fast forward to now, I have been in client meetings, manager meetings, they announced my promotion to the other PMs, and been given a plan for which client and project I will be managing but NO SALARY INFO YET.  Although I have not technically started in the position yet.

I have also been moved on to a temporary project as an unofficial tech lead until I officially begin my project management position in about a month.  Which also should command a higher pay.

So I really didnt want all this extra responsibility if the salary increase wasnt worth it.  But I feel like I have basically said yes, thinking I would get the salary info up front but havnt received it yet, and they are saying they will give me my full ""promotion report"" next month.

So does anyone know what kind of salary I should expect?   Should I ask for extra for filling in for the sales position during the summer?  The sales position now does not include any commission and is salary based.  Also is this normal to get a promotion then the company be like, I'll get back with you on that, and slowly, randomly start to roll you on?

I am located in the midwest.  What would you do?

2. Work in the Junior Research Labs department of the United Nations CTAD Youth Action Hub of India. Managed and edited the content for Linkedln articles ( so v formal and professional). Also run my own content series on Sustainable Finance within this vertical. Currently designing a social program Student Changemaker's Program (ps applications opening soon so do apply) along with the rest of the team. Will prolly join the editorial board in the org soon.

5- I like to work on business and entrepreneurial projects - a non profit org idea which I conceived after attending a summer program called Junior MBA by the faculty of Brown University. Rn created a website as my project has been selected in a program run by Rhodes Foundation, so hopefully get some scholarships afterwards. It's basically bridging the gap between rural/local businesses and the customers + NGOs. Main idea was to combat income inequality and its subsequent implications, so it developed into this initiative. Hopefully would have something concrete by the time college apps start.

6- Write for the school newspaper as a sub editor . It is kinda special since our circulation is nationwide through all 15+ branches of our school and 2-3 universities.

7-  Maintain a personal blog on economic trends and concepts so it keeps me updated.

8- I am very interested in Investing and the Stock Market. I participated in the Wharton Global High School Investment Competition. Unfortunately, couldn't win but using that knowledge to try to open a financial literacy for kids platform and do personal investing. #buildcollegefunds.

9- I am the Vice Captain of the Senior Basketball Team ( idk what varsity is explain- we don't have the culture here) - barely won matches but keeps me healthy ( at least that's what I tell myself after eating an entire box of pizza)

My internship is supposed to start in 5 days and I haven’t gotten my equipment, nor have I heard anything about what I am expected to do on my first day. I sent an email to the manager yesterday but I still haven’t heard back (it’s been over 24 hours). Should I be worried?"

I'm currently doing my master's and I'm in my last year. Fortunately, I've got an insane opportunity to join a Fortune 500 company as an intern.

The internship would be part-time during school, paid, flexible, can work 1 day at home. I would have to work 20-25 hours a week. They said, they want me long-term so I can join after graduating or even before.

But, there is one issue: The company is 30 miles away from my home so in order to get in the office before 8AM, I would have to wake up at 5:45AM. I would be home at 3PM tho. I have to work 4-5 times a week.

So, the only issue is, waking up early. To be honest, I usually sleep between 5-6 hours, most of the times I sleep 6 hours and I'm totally fine. I think I could compensate it with 1 day working from home and the weekends but I'm not sure.

*(I saw this new buzz about Goldman Sachs working hours and that gave me motivation to do this, but I want to know your opinions.)*


So, should I go for it or no? Tips? Am I overreacting?"

One of them is just 2 guys and the other is a bit larger at around 18-20 full-time employees. I marginally like the smaller startup more, but I think I made a good connection with both founders.  However, I was curious if this would still look good on my resume?  I'd be doing software development at both and I think both would definitely give me good experience, but I was curious if the second company would look a little better due to its larger size and it possibly being more established.  And it's not that I would necessarily choose one just because it looks better on my resume, but it's a factor to consider.

Thanks!"

I got a bachelors in criminology &amp; minored in russian. I was a competitive cheerleader, had internships, worked as a server, was in a sorority... the usual

So basically I worked in auto insurance claims as my first real job out of college. 
 
Things I liked: 

Coworkers 
Opportunities to advance,
Schedule (ability to plan in advance; take weekend trips, see friends, etc),
Hard work was noticed and rewarded monetarily,
Commute,
The ability to research &amp; “dig stuff up”,
Having a small clue and working through it to find more information - put the story together/timeline,
Working with people/bouncing ideas off of each other

Things I didn’t like:
Repetitiveness of tasks,
Working from home during covid felt isolating,
Company did not attempt to hire more people knowing we were overworked,
Didn’t believe in the mission - not a company type I would prefer to work for 

Then I got a chance to go to the police academy. I graduated and started the job IRL. But it really went against a lot of my internal values and I hadn’t realized how drastic that was. I was suffering mentally and physically. So I resigned and they respected me for it and have helped me with my resume and keeping benefits as long as possible. They even offered me a job as a dispatcher. I shadow one tomorrow but I’m so worried and don’t want to settle considering I’ve wasted what feels like a lot of time.

Everyone I asked about what I do well - they say I’m determined. 

I also have this issue that im very aware of that I have trouble keeping engaged and motivated when I’m feeling stagnant. 

I studied abroad in Russia for a summer and it was probably one of the best parts of my life. 

Is there anything. Any of you have done to figure out a new path? Any similar stories? Thank you so much."

I'm a third year student looking for internships right now, and I currently have a lot of classes too.

I'm honestly already pretty overwhelmed with just how many classes I have and all the studying I have to do already, so I would definitely prefer not to study extra, but if I actually need to study then I will 100% do it.

Keep in mind: I am currently in one social org (asian american association, will join VSA this or next year), I have a very, very limited resume (no work experience at all), and I'd like to travel to Florida some time in the summer.

1. Does anyone know of any academic-related summer opportunities open to engineering freshmen? I'd prefer if the opportunity is online. Are there any open clubs, projects, research, etc? It seems like co-ops, internships, and research are for sophomore/junior year and are typically in-person. If upper-classmen can speak on their experiences in past or current clubs they're in, that'd be great!
2. What are the best engineering clubs right now? Any specific electrical engineering clubs that are good? I have done some research and am not interested in ArborHacks or some hacking club. Data science looks uninteresting as well (feel free to change my mind!). Coding is interesting in general, though. The big projects like MASA, MRover, etc. look interesting but when should I join one of them?

If I don't end up doing anything for the summer, I will probably take Physics 240 in the summer via community college online."
mci3nv,4,2021-03-24,Changing major without telling my parents?,Alcsi69,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mci3nv/changing_major_without_telling_my_parents/,"Hey!

I think this will be a longer post.

So first of all, I live in Hungary and I'll be 23 years old on the 28th of this month.

In my first couple of years in high school, I really wanted to be an Economic Analyst or anything really who does analysis in the economic field. Unfortunately, my parents told that I should be an engineer or an IT guy instead, so I lost my ambition to be an analyst.

After I finished high school, I went to study Computer Science, but I hated everything at that university (besides the actual programming stuff and math) so I changed to Electrical Engineering at another university in another city.

For the first couple of semesters, I really liked it. I always loved tinkering with gadgets and stuff, math was pretty easy for me and I did well at other subjects too. After some time, my enthusiasm began to wane: there were more and more subjects that I really didn't care about. I was constantly thinking about why would X or Y subject be important for any job I'd do. These subjects weren't even that hard, but they felt pretty useless. We'd get more and more of these subjects, instead of those that I liked or I cared about.

We have something called specializations here where you'll learn more of those subjects you are interested in. This was a pretty big dilemma for me, because I had two choices:

1. I'll apply for the specialization I'd be more interested in, but the chance that I get accepted is pretty low.
2. I'll apply for the other specialization, and the chance that I get accepted is almost 100%.

So the dilemma here is that if I don't get accepted to the specialization, the whole course would take longer by one year. I was afraid of that, so I choose option 2. I think this was a huge mistake by me.

Now, there are absolutely ZERO subjects that I'm interested in. On top of that, we have some newer teachers who are horrible. Like REALLY horrible:

* They can't really teach (but that's pretty common in Hungary in every uni). They just read out their powerpoint or pdf loud and that's it.
* They don't even provide any resources and materials that are at least decent. These materials would make a professional at that particular field cry. 
* There are many subjects that are almost impossible for me to complete. They are so hard to grasp for me, and that's also because I don't really care about them. That's why the whole course would take me another one or two years, instead of the one remaining year. 

One of my biggest problems is that the university is in a bigger city, but that doesn't mean it has any good opportunities. There aren't really any good intern job possibilities and stuff and I know that I won't have a good job just because I finish this BSc. I'd need to work as an intern at a bigger company (or more) and try to build some relationships. That's pretty impossible here. So my option would be to apply as an intern to a bigger company, but then if I'd get accepted I'd have to travel so much it would be pretty umbearable. 

So I've been thinking about changing majors and going to the capital, instead of these ""smaller"" cities. Then, I could learn the stuff I'm more interested in (like business informatics) and I would be able to apply as an intern to so many companys it'd be awesome. There was an event here in Hungary recently. There were 72 companies as exhibitors, and I could talk to a lot of these companies' representatives and they have so many awesome intern positions it blew my mind!

So, you could ask: what holds you back?

First of all, my mother is pretty strange with this kind of stuff. Like if I'd like to do something, but she doesn't like that then she'd argue with me like hell. So if I'd ask her if I could change majors she would say yes, or she'd get angry and stuff like that.

I've been thinking about not telling her. I'm almost 23 years old and I don't think I'd have to tell her everything. Of course, she'd find out at my graduation or something, but then she wouldn't be able to do anything about it right? Even better if I'd graduate while I already have some great job offers or something like that.

What do you guys think about this? What'd you do? I really need you advice.

Thanks in advance!"

I only have had non-coding internships as work experience so far. I'd say I am proficient with python but that's it. Appreciate any advice for a booming career field with less competition right now.

(Edit: I forgot to mention that I also need a H1B visa so I will be limited to the companies that can afford it. Which would mean that the pay for those fields needs to be high as well 😑)"

First, regarding my own feelings about coding, I do not have what some would call a love or passion for it but feel like it is the only path should take as I dislike other subjects. Right now I'm in what I would call a reforming period, trying to raise grades, pay attention more during classes, improving work ethic, etc. However, the main problem lies in CS. I first started learning CS in high school where I was taught simple coding in java which was mostly OOP. I know nothing about other languages except learning about simple number/string operations from recent learning endeavors. After looking around on the internet, I see much too many things that I don't understand. LeetCode is an example as how I tried doing a few test problems but came up with almost nothing. With the way things are now I feel like I won't be able to score an internship even if I tried to while in college, have heard that ""projects"" I am interested in would help, but again, I don't really have a big interest in anything, and feel like I won't advance in my career/do well even if I am employed. All in all, I'm slowly feeling like my future in the CS field is becoming harder and harder and would like opinions on others who've felt this way or tips on learning.

TLDR: High school senior going to major in CS who learned Java OOP for 2 years and almost no knowledge about any other language. Don't really like any other subject and chose CS because its the only thing I felt I could do. Tried to expand my knowledge with things like LeetCode but fell flat. Slowly losing myself in a sea of thoughts like ""I'm not ready"" or ""My career was over before it started."" Looking for opinions on others who felt the same or tips to start learning and possibly a bright future.

mcn69t,2,2021-03-24,New grad: Big Tech or Series C Unicorn?,ejsjzjxjdjdjjsjsuxj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mcn69t/new_grad_big_tech_or_series_c_unicorn/,"I'm currently a new grad considering two offers both are roughly same TC. I currently have 2 FAANG (same company) internships under my belt. I'm thinking I want to work on distributed systems and learn how to build applications that scale and grow my career from there.

Here's my options:

\-Big tech: Mature product with 100s of millions of users. However, a lot of the work is just small features being added here and there. There's an interesting backend side but I'm not sure if I'll be able to work on designing it but rather just maintain and add features.  


\-Series C Unicorn with 100s of millions in funding: My team project is related to the cloud and very visible within the company. Success of the project will highly impact the success of company. The only downside is that pretty much half the team (and 60% of the company) are new grads. Right now the team only has a toy flask app for what the product should be and everyones kinda just figuring stuff out lol.

I'm worried that if I join the start up, I may end up contributing to a spaghetti new grad codebase and never really learn proper software engineering practices out of college. This could especially be the case if the start up doesn't take off and instead just vibes for a long time (the market they target is still immature). Furthermore, not having a brand name could make it hard for a career switch. But on the upside, I could work on a project from day 1 which scales to 100s of millions of datapoints and reads/writes and build a strong backend from scratch.

the upside of joining Big tech is that as a new grad I get a lot of experience working on a mature product and learn good SWE practices and also It's a good name to have on my resume. But I don't know how fast I can grow a career just doing app dev, full-stack dev, and expanding existing services the way I would if i worked on a potentially growing highly visible product.

any advice would be appreciated!!"
mcn7n5,7,2021-03-24,Quantity Vs Quality: The strategy that changed it all.,SkiesinmyMind,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/mcn7n5/quantity_vs_quality_the_strategy_that_changed_it/,"**********************************************
TL,DR: I used this strategy and got a job in 3 weeks after applying for 2 years doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same result; rejection. This is a very detailed post and a 10 mins read but if you don’t have the time and just don’t want to, you can just read the main points below. However, the details will help you  better understand and show you a different way to apply the main points.

Strategy:

1. Know yourself and your strengths: what do you want to do? Can you align it with the company’s mission, projects etc? Study your resume to find your strengths and areas of growth.

2. Quality above quantity. Instead of randomly applying for 10 jobs a day, it’s better to excellently apply to 2 or 3 a day by doing research, tailoring your resume to the specific job and cover letter if necessary, then reach out to a LinkedIn connection that works in the company.

3. LinkedIn: Don’t be scared to go the extra mile and reach out to someone who works there, ask if you can learn about the culture through them, and if the conversation is going well, send them your resume and ask if they don’t mind referring you.

4. Interview process: Preparation is vital. Use online resources like Glassdoor, research your interviewers, be honest in the interview AKA be yourself and always ask questions 

5. Follow up. Thank you notes.

************************************************

Details start below.

Here’s a strategy and mindset I used and with it, I recently got my dream Job at a big company (one of the big 4’s). I mention this because academically, my GPA was no where close to what they usually go for. I did do 4 internships while in school (4 different companies) and worked for two different companies upon graduation.  (One for 2 months and another for 7 months)

So you can imagine how my resume looks like. A not so great GPA (below 3.0) and what appears to be a record of inconsistency and a diverse set of experiences. I thought there’s no way a top company will look my way. Thing is, I didn’t know my value, what I bring to the table, or how to leverage all I had learnt from my diverse expériences to present that as an added value.

THE STRATEGY

1. SIT DOWN WITH YOURSELF AND KNOW YOURSELF 

A. What do you want to do? 

No really. What do you want to do? This part is hard. Sometimes all you want to do is just make some money regardless of the job you get. But here’s the thing; when you’re excited about what you want to do, people/employers pick up on that energy. Even better, when you connect what you’re passionate about with the mission, projects, of the company, then they would want you on their team because they know that money is not your only driving force but passion for your work will motivate you too. At the end of the day, they are people like us and connection on some level is what people look for.


B. Find your strengths. 

Go through your resume: From your education to your most recent experience and really ask yourself: “What do I want an employer to know about me through this particular experience” Then think of specific instances that reflect that. For instance. I wanted an employer to know that my education was the root/foundation for my interest in technology, data and analytics then I talked about specific classes I took or projects I did that sparked my interest. Do this for every experience and write your responses down on a document.


2. QUALITY ABOVE QUANTITY 

STOP randomly applying to every job you see.   Quantity without quality is more a waste of time than anything else. It takes a lot of effort to properly apply to a role so I don’t understand how people (myself included 🤣) apply to 10-15 jobs in one day. Here’s how I changed my strategy:

A. RESEARCH. 
This honestly was the backbone of my strategy. I researched the company I wanted to apply to. Mostly the career page. And some companies give tips on how to format your resume so it’s appealing to their employers, how to answer interview questions, what questions to ask etc. Some have these resources on their career page. We just don’t go looking for it. The one time I did, I literally followed step by step what they advised, changed the format of my resume, added a “core competencies” section like they said and applied. Truth is, you can’t change the format of your resume for every company. So I looked at the company I wanted the most and followed their advice. Great thing is; The format is so professional and eye catching that I used it for every other job. DM me if you’d like to see/use this format. Happy to share. Main takeaway here is, check if they give any advice on their site and apply it if you can.

B. KEYWORDS in the role description 

This is time consuming but worth it. Substitute some skills on your resume with skills listed on the job description without exaggerating or lying please haha. For instance, If your resume says “process improvement” and the job says “process optimization” then change “improvement” to “optimization” on your resume. Do this as much as you can.

C. Cover Letter?

Sometimes this is not necessary BUT if you’re lacking significant work experience/skills in what they need but can substitute that experience/those skills with skills you learnt from projects, side hustles lol, self-education, weekend work, very interesting hobby (emphasis on “very”) and then connect what you learnt or skills you acquired through those personal experiences to the skills needed for the job, then a cover letter will do you great justice here. Show your interest in the company. 

3. LINKEDIN 

Sometimes it’s about who wants the job the most. Find someone on LinkedIn who can tell you more about the company, their experience being interviewed, then you can talk about yourself, interest, share resume and after some time (few days), finally mention how you’ve done more research on the company and you are excited about this opportunity and close it up with “do you think I’ll be a good fit and if you do, do you mind referring me?” This sounds scary right? Hitting up a stranger to refer you?. I got a referral from a manager in this company, I never knew him and I only spoke to him twice on LinkedIn. Thing too is, there is a referral bonus. So  some people are eager to refer someone if they think it’s a good match. So ask away. Worst thing they say is “no”. Gracefully say you completely understand and don’t burn bridges.

4. INTERVIEW 

A. Preparation is VITAL. 

Technically, if you did steps 1-3 right, you’ve been already preparing for the interview. Go through your experiences and see what’s most relevant to the job, study your resume like you have an exam. 

- In the inevitable “Tell me about yourself” question, that’s your chance to show how your skills and education and leadership experiences or side hustles, major personal experiences have prepared you for the role. You can’t do this without first knowing what the company wants and then knowing what you can offer. There’s no way around this. You’ve got to sit down with yourself and do the work of thinking, jotting down bullet points and connecting skills with role requirements.

B. ONLINE RESOURCES

Go to google, Glassdoor, indeed, and check for interview questions for the particular role and specific company you’re interviewing with. You’ll see people posting questions on Glassdoor that are Similar. Take note of those. Make sure you filter to “most recent” so Glassdoor shows you the most recent reviews/interview experiences that have been posted for that particular role. 

Also check the salary range for that role so that you know what they typically pay and make your decision to continue the process based on that. Don’t lowball yourself or undersell your value due to desperation. I did it once and the job ended horribly. Look at a combination of the non-monetary value you’ll get, by working in that company and the salary/benefits they offer. If you see they will value you, then go ahead and tell the recruiter your expectatives salary when asked. But first do research on the salary they offer for that role.

C. HONESTY

I should say “be yourself” but I’ll rather put it as “honesty” because you’re most yourself when you’re doing everything with &amp;amp;amp; in truth. Case in point: I had 4 interviews with this company and during my second interview, I really believe I botched that one. I did not refresh my memory on specific technical skills that I honestly thought were not relevant. But the interviewer asked me to explain in detail how to apply that skill. In my mind, I went “oh crap oh crap oh crap” but I tried to explain what I could remember. Then halfway into it, we both said at the Same time “oh wait I think I’m explaining another skill” and then we both started laughing. Then I told him “Honestly I didn’t refresh my memory on this since I did it years ago but truth is, I am a quick learner and if I ever need to apply it, I’ll pick it up in less than a few minutes” and he said “Ok I got you” and we moved on. 
So my advice is to treat the person at the other side of the table/screen as human first and then “possible employer” second. They deserve a genuine interaction as much as you do.

D. ASK QUESTIONS 

Never say I don’t have a question. In fact, be proactive about asking questions at the end. I honestly think what impressed one of my interviewers was me saying “well do you have a minute or two to spare for a question” when I realized he didn’t ask me if I wanted to ask him anything at the end of our call. I then asked him a specific question about his background that I saw on his LinkedIn profile. And my question invoked a profound response from him - one about finding your  purpose in life and managing your objectives to meet that etc. Though this was the interview I “botched” above, it ended in a wholesome way just because of one question.

Do research on the interviewers as well. Not only the company. LinkedIn is your friend here. And structure your questions around their experiences, the company, the role you’re applying to, the culture etc. So make sure you ask the main recruiter the names of the individuals you’ll be interviewing with before the day of your interview.

5. FOLLOW UP

If you can, send out a thank you note to each interviewer. If you don’t have their information, ask the main recruiter if it’s possible to get their emails. If she/he says no, then you thank them and let it be or for our ambitious ones, reach out on LinkedIn and say thank you. I honestly didn’t do this part for my last interview because about 30 mins after my interview, when I reached out to the main recruiter to ask for the emails of the interviewers, she was excitedly, very mildly, screaming into the phone telling me I got the job lol. She was a gem. Haha. So I didn’t send one. Though I probably should have anyways. Oh shoot I probably should have hahaha. Anyways, with other interviews, I did.

So here’s the strategy I implemented. As you can see, It will be very tiring to apply to as many as 10 jobs in one day if you have to combine research, with resume tailoring, and networking just to apply to one job. I used to do that and had to change my strategy to focus on quality rather than quantity. Let me know how this works out for you. Rooting for you!!! Remember, You only fail when you give up on yourself. Take breaks, short, long, whatever but keep moving forward, as slowly or quickly as you need to. Finally, thank you for reading this mini ebook lol."

So I landed a position as an intern in an industrial magnet plant. The contract I signed stated that I cannot wear metals of any kind on the floor and my phone has to be left in a secure locker because of the damage it can do to the phone.

Now, the HR person I spoke to said that all staff are given composite toed shoes and PPE by the company BUT that I was responsible for non PPE clothing.

Button down shirts, socks, etc I'm ok on, but does anyone know where I can find men's ""Metal free"" pants that aren't super expensive? I've looked online, but most come to be $50/pair and I don't have that much.

Thank you and if any of you have similar internship experiences would you mind dm'ing me. Thank you!!!"

mcqdyq,4,2021-03-25,What's the deal with summer internships for international Master's Thesis students?,a4555in,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/mcqdyq/whats_the_deal_with_summer_internships_for/,"Incoming Master's thesis student for Fall21, Computer Science here. I am confused about what internships opportunities are available to me in the summer semester. I've been in contact with a few people on Linkedin but what I gathered from them has only confused me more. Here's what I know:

* Canada law allows international students to only work for 20hr/week if they have a ""student"" status.
* Thesis students are considered to be in ""student"" status throught the summer semester.
* Some people on Linkedin told me thesis students don't do any internships while others told me they did do internships after informing their supervisors.


This leads me to believe internships are rare for thesis students as we have to find an employeer that is willing to offer a 20hr/week internship. Is this correct? Do the majority of thesis students not do any intenship? Does your supervisor have the authority to allow/prevent you from doing an intenship?"
mcqh59,0,2021-03-25,Minor in CS,NearbyProfessional0,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/mcqh59/minor_in_cs/,"I was accepted as a Data Science major and had a few questions.

I'm also looking to do undergrad research in the field of AI/ML and heard that although knowledge in python and stats is needed, core CS courses will help a lot.

Is taking those low-level programming classes with the CS minor along with the more python/statistics based courses in data science major prepare me for both jobs and masters degrees in AI/Data Science/General CS?

(Btw, this is assuming I won't be able to add CS as a second choice (or CODO) bc I've seen on this subreddit how difficult it is. If I'm able to do either of those two then a minor in CS would be irrelevant.)"

However last year I had landed a finance internship with the company Big Green up in Boulder, but it was cancelled due to COVID-19.

I use the resources given to me at school, and every time an employer reaches out to apply, I apply but never hear from them.

mcseak,1,2021-03-25,First job for an anxious Indian tech student and second thoughts,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mcseak/first_job_for_an_anxious_indian_tech_student_and/,"Starting with a little bit of context, I am an undergraduate student from India. I haven't graduated yet but will do so by this May. I received a long term internship offer in July 2020 from a Fortune 500 Company which is a market leader in its segment. I was really excited as the requirement from me was on the lines of Data Engineering, Data Science and Analysis. This is what I have been focusing on for the last ~4 years of graduation.

After 5 months of understanding OTC processes and using my skills to build efficient reporting tools, I was given a full time offer effective as soon as I graduate. And I am still interning there itself. However, in recent months, my job has changed into more of a functional expert and this requires me to closely work with many people (mostly managers and their bosses) from different departments.

I know my stuff, but I have a huge anxiety problem and hence, each of my working days start with me being anxious about meetings and what if I make a mess. I am asked to provide support that otherwise would be asked by managers or senior managers and I am just an intern. This is causing me to not like my job anymore since I have to also juggle my University with this. WFH has made it worse because I feel rather isolated and the working hours often cross the 9 hour mark. 

Now this is causing a dilema. This is my first job and when I join as an FTE, the pay+allowances is good. I also need to get experience to pursue further education. Having said that, I am not enjoying the life now, and this anxiety is affecting my health significantly. 

Now for the questions of this post:

1. How do I deal with this anxiety?
2. What are my options as an Indian tech student right now before May who wants work in data?
3. Anything in the world that can help me in any way coz I am going nuts.

Thanks in advance."

I started figuring out about the whole applying to internships process in the Fall semester of my junior year ( Fall 2019) and I got burned out from applying, practicing via leetcode, extracurricular activities, and trying to pass my CS classes. ( I was struggling hard to get to the passing percentage). 

since I had such a hard time in fall semester I left my extracurricular activities and devoted my time to my cs classes and learning/doing projects in my spare time. It's almost April and I think the time to apply for summer 2021 internships is starting to end. 

I'm wondering what I can do this summer to improve, but also whether I should take a gap semester to do projects, study, and apply to internships without having to juggle my cs classes. It would also allow me to have one extra summer to have an internship. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Any advice is appreciated!"

Nothing is broken up.  n\^4 loops constantly used with some files being large 5k lines where class definitions and implementations and functions and everything the code does is all in the same place.  The code is in C# and connects with another vba type module (again something I have zero experience in but the main issue is the C#).

My issue is that it has taken me 3 weeks to wrap my head around this code base.  A major issue was that one of the developers kept misleading me about what was going on.  The C# uses an auto-generated code from an XML SOAP service.  I couldn't figure out how the data was getting assigned because again I've not really used SOAP (alot of REST), never used C#, never seen reference files.  So I thought, because of the developer, that maybe it was still relying on the old code that was all still in it and calling a db it shouldn't.

I wasted a week on this line of reasoning only to fine out that it not the case.  Then the developer tells oh that the auto-generated code in the reference files is auto-populated... Again I'm like okay but like I guess that makes sense but how....he doesn't provide any detail.  I finally figured out what was going on after logging some stuff to check but feel like my ability to get help and guidance (from individuals who have a number of years experience over me and who have worked primiarly in C#) is difficult.

Often times when I ask questions about why did u do X or Y I will be made to feel like ""code however you want.""  When all I am trying to do is soak up the knowledge of people who are further along at this than me.

I guess the question is...is it normal to sometimes be misled by senior devs, or to just be treated like asking questions is questioning someones ability to code?"

Meanwhile my friends in mechanical and chemical engineering get internships given to them directly from their college. They just have to tell the school that they want one.

I love coding and software dev, but I don't love it enough to do it 16 hours a day like some people are on leetcode and stackoverflow. I feel like you need a 3.8+ GPA, 20+ projects, and membership in several different college clubs for CS employers to even spit in your direction. 

Please someone give me some reassurance, I feel like I'm just a number on a spreadsheet and my resume will only ever be seen by artificial intelligence. I want a job in the industry but I am losing my mind."

To provide some background, I'm interested in Distributed Systems and Machine Learning.

From what I've heard:

Gatech:

Pros:

* Better Reputation
* Cheaper (\~15K difference)
* Better Career Fairs
* TA is 100% fee waiver

Cons:

* Georgia isn't the most happening place
* Heard rumors about Online MSCS effecting reputation (Not sure how true this is)
* Racism towards Asians? (Just learning about this)

UCSD:

Pros:

* Lots of tech companies in vicinity = better internship opportunities?
* Nice area, weather is great
* Has really good Systems faculty
* Better chances of getting TA? (From what I have heard)

Cons:

* More expensive
* TA is only 50% fee waiver
* Career fairs aren't that great (Again from what I know)

Any help would be appreciated!"

At present, I am really confused about job prospects after completing my graduation in economics and I do not know which field I could possibly pursue as a career. I think that I am facing decision fatigue. 

My background - I have a bachelor's degree in economics and I am currently edging towards the completion of my first year as part of my two-year masters degree in economics. I have a 4.0 GPA in both bachelor's and master's degree and have completed one internship. I had applied to some companies online for a summer 2021 internship, such as Goldman Sachs, and didn't get any calls for further rounds of interviews and I believe my resume was not considered. So I started looking for ways to improve my resume by learning more skills that will help me secure internships somewhere else and started reconsidering my interest in finance. 

But here is the catch when it comes to learning skills - if I have to go in finance, most finance jobs require a background in Finance and Accounting, which I lack to a great extent. On the other hand, I am deeply interested in data/business analytics, statistics, mathematics and computer science, which I really enjoy but do not have skills in and I am worried about the immense competition in this field which I will have to face because of the number of data/business analysts that are presently looking for jobs. I do not know how to shortlist from among them and what courses can I do that will help me secure a job. I would love some insights from anyone willing to help. I am actually worried at this point. Thank you in advance! 




TL, DR - Confused between finance and data/business analytics as a career. Need insights."

I still have not been part of any internship program at a company, although I do have other CS/professional work experience.

My freshman year and the summer after I assisted a professor in my school's computer science department which involved writing python scripts to manipulate data and some cloud database use. The following school year I started as a web developer at my university's IT department where I am responsible for a web application I built from nearly scratch, is used by an internal team, and has gone through a continuous cycle of improvements and new features based on feedback from said team. I worked on this through the school year, this past summer, and currently still do. A few months ago I also started working at a local startup on the side, and I have been doing web development there as well under the direction of the founder who acts as product manager/owner. I have influenced some significant design decisions and have implemented a few features.

I feel I've learned a lot through these positions, but I still haven't done any formal summer internships or coops. The summer is approaching soon as well and there may be the possibility that I don't get an internship during what might be my last summer in undergrad, in which case I would continue working at one or both of these positions I already have. I wonder if this will be viewed negatively by employers when applying for jobs post-graduation? I am also concerned that I might be missing out on a learning experience I could get if I sought an internship in a sub-field I'm not that familiar with. Are these concerns valid?"

However, I recently got accepted into my #1 grad school pick that I honestly thought I had no chance at and now I'm reconsidering things. The contract I signed for my job had a little note which basically said ""hey, if you're waiting on grad school admissions, accept the job now and we can talk later"" so I don't feel like I'm absolutely locked in yet.

I'm wondering for those who have been in this position before, what kind of options there realistically are or will I have to pick one or the other? The master's program involves an internship as well as a research thesis so would it be unheard of to coordinate with Amazon so that the research topic is chosen in collaboration with them and that they would be involved in the process?

\---

Here's a bit more of a breakdown of my personal motivations if this post isn't long enough already

**School (would be living abroad):**

\- Very well ranked school, has the opportunity to really elevate my insight into my field

\- I believe that my twenties are a really special chapter in my life where there is so much opportunity to do different things and I value having varied experiences and perspectives. The living abroad part definitely is a major factor here but also getting real exposure to academia. I've heard from others how doing organized research can change the way you think

\- While I do think I'm ultimately industry focused, if I never challenge myself to consider otherwise, I'll never know. I have the rest of my life to work in industry whereas I don't feel the same about this opportunity

**Job (would be living in a city I've had multiple internships in before):**

\- Getting an early start at my career with a great company

\- If I really value being able to do different things, earning money is the best way to do so. I could work a few years and go off to be a digital nomad or something crazy if I really wanted that. Besides, I know how much work these upper year computer science courses can be, even if I'm abroad, I probably won't have as much time as I want to go ""explore"" and stuff, might end up grinding work in the library most of the time"

I’m interning in Tax. I’d like to ask about when I should ask about transferring from SF to Orange County (OC). Most of my offers are currently in SF. I haven’t started my internship yet, but the location is very important to me and I’d like to live in OC. I applied to SF to get my foot in the door. 

When should I bring it up that I’d like to transfer? Now, before my internship starts? After I get my offer, if I get one? Or should I wait one year after full employment? I’m worried about transferring because I heard that you’ll get the worst clients and you our performance reviews will be bad since you’re new. Do you have any thoughts?

In this vein, I’m not sure how to choose which firm, Because I would like to transfer offices, I don’t really know the culture at the OC office. Should I go with the firm who pays the most, or the one I vibe with? I’m worried about going with the one I vibe with because I only met the recruiter and my two interviewers from the firm, so I’m not sure if that’s enough to make a solid decision + the location transfer change in the future.

As you can see, I’m quite conflicted. Thank you in advance.

TLDR: As someone who hasn’t started their internship program, when should I inquire about transferring? And how do you choose the firm you’ll work at?"

I'm currently a senior in High school and am planning on majoring in Computer Science in university. I plan on entering community college next year. I've come to an understanding that, traditionally, students begin internships in their sophomore and junior years. I feel that community college may put a hindrance on my ability to be accepted for an internship.

My question is, what can I do now to ""beef up"" my resume and have a better chance at getting an internship?

Currently, I'm taking a class called AP Computer Science A. It is a college level, Java based course that is equivalent to an introductory computer science course.  

I will have much more free time this summer. What are ways that I can continue to expand in Java? What would be a realistic ""goal"" to set based on my current age and experience?"

In May of my senior year of HS I was depressed and only got into some mediocre OOS publics. I didn't do great during my first semester of CC either because I was depressed about being there and being a disappointment to my Asian parents. 

Second semester of CC I got my head focused on my goals and in 2018 I got into several T-20s including UCLA, Georgetown, and USC in addition to Berkeley and some other great CS schools like UCSD. I was really active on this sub and it helped a lot.

More importantly I got an internship while I was still at community college at a top company (and I have some posts in my post history that talk about that) and learned how much getting your resume rolling early matters (way more than your school).

At Berkeley I was in L&amp;S CS and I still had to take the same classes and meet the GPA requirement to declare. I participated in two competitive clubs (clubs you have to apply for and interview for to get into) and a couple programs. 

So AMA about

- Berkeley (especially resources for students interested in CS/tech/tech entrepreneurship) - you DO NOT have to be a CS/MET/EECS/DS major to get involved, I have lots of friends who were in majors like econ or public health that are now working in technical and non technical functions at tech companies

- Transferring

- CA community colleges

mdahfx,2,2021-03-25,Career Pivot,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mdahfx/career_pivot/,"Hi all,

I am a 25 year old  radio frequency engineer and would like to switch careers to computer science. My current plan is to take a couple classes at community college in basic programming, data structures &amp; algorithms, etc then transfer into Georgia Tech's online masters in CS program. My concern is that I have no internships or work experience in CS and don't want to graduate without relevant jobs on my resume. My current salary is decent and I recognize that if I'm going to make a career pivot I may need to accept a short term salary cut to gain some experience and get my foot in the door. But I am unsure of exactly how to time my transition to get a quality first job.

What I would like to know is:

When should I start looking for jobs in computer science? While I'm taking community college classes, when I get in to Georgia Tech (Assuming I do), or after graduation?

Is it worth looking into internships?

Thanks!"

So should I tell the recruiters - if they ask about my timeline/career plans, about the upcoming internship I have already accepted (at a different company obviously) and plan to do in summer before potentially joining their company? (Or just say I'll be available starting from September)

Pro:

\- shows that I was already able to pass an interview process and might give them confidence to let me move forward in their process as well

\- shows that I'll have some more practical exp until I start position at their company

Con:

\- feels weird talking about an upcoming position at another company!?

\- as internships often aim to have a conversion to FTEs, they might be concerned I get a FT offer from the other company before even joining their company?

&amp;#x200B;

If yes, should I also say at which company I'll do the other internship, or just keep it generic?"
mdbv1i,3,2021-03-25,MidLife Crisis at 22,Buffythedog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mdbv1i/midlife_crisis_at_22/," 

Hey Reddit!! I had a question to ask the internet and figured there is no better place.

I am faced with a current mid life crisis but not really mid-life since I am only 22.

I recently graduated with a degree in Business Admin with a Major in Information Systems. I picked it because it was honestly an easier degree to obtain while working full-time. I got a job in tech support for a pretty sweet company which has decent benefits and alright oay. It averages out to about $38,000 a year.

Here is my dilemma, while I currently love my coworkers and enjoy the company’s mission and focus, I am not passionate about the job at all. The company definitely has great opportunities to move up but no so much in the directions I would want to go in now that I understand myself and goals more clearly.

The previous 6 months have been extremely eye opening for me in that I got to focus on school entirely for my final semester of classes. I took a full time course load and got involved in multiple clubs, including clubs around my Information Systems major which led me to networking and finding my job at my current company. I only got to experience this as I was let go from my job and decided  to go all in with school, usually I would prioritize work.

I want to go back to school for two things that have always nagged at me and recently the nagging has greatly intensified.

I want to go back to university for a bachelor’s in Computer Science with a dialed in focus of prioritizing my education, clubs, and networking.

The few coding classes I have taken within my MIS major have always been my favorites although the most challenging but always doable with the appropriate amount of time dedicated to it. (Coding In C, Java, and a Database SQL class).

I really want to dive into the world of Computer Science and want to take this opportunity to redo my education right.

I’ve always been afraid of Debt which has led me to stay at home with my parents at a commuter school with limited networking and focus on working so much that I would push my studies to the side.

I just need one last reality check that this is a good idea before I leave my job and hunker down into college student mode.

I already have a good sense of budgeting and about 35,000k saved up that I can use towards paying for my school and housing situation as the school I would like to go to, The University of Central Florida, is not commuting distance from my parents house.

So reddit, should I leave my job and redo my bachelors the right way with getting actively involved, searching for internships, networking, work on side projects and diving into the world of CS. This would probably incur some form of student loans towards the end of bacehlors as I feel a part time job/internship and my 35,000 may not be enough for 3 years of instate school.

or should I play it the safe route and keep my Full-time job and maintain my retirement saving, investing, and money that I have currently saved up while going at the CS degree part-time at a commuter school that has very limited networking opportunities. The job would also interfere with my networking and force me to go strictly online to fit my schedule."
mdc72u,5,2021-03-25,best us city to start from rock bottom-ish?,oh_lord_help_me,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mdc72u/best_us_city_to_start_from_rock_bottomish/,"i (19-he/they) am a college student on the verge of dropping out due to my declining mental health. my adhd, anxiety and depression have hindered my ability to function in everyday life. i am currently dependent on my parents, and i know me dropping out will rock the boat. not only is there probably no way for me to pass this semester, but i’d rather not stay at a religious university my parents pressured me to go to (despite me not believing in said religion anymore).

i feel like a major problem i’m facing is that, to put it bluntly, i just don’t know how to live. my parents have pretty much carved the path they want me to take. my true aspirations are entering the music industry as both a record producer and a performer in my own right. i am willing to put in the effort to educate myself on how to create professional-sounding songs and market myself accordingly.

going back to what i said before, my parents definitely wouldn’t back me dropping out. i’ve seriously been considering just moving out and living on my own somewhere else, so i don’t have to feel bound by their influence or expectations.

the problem is, i have no idea where to go. i want to go somewhere i can SURVIVE, first and foremost. i have 3k saved up but i have very little job experience, just an internship and a training. i will tolerate literally any job that doesn’t require mass amounts of manual labor. after all, none of that is part of my end goal. i just want to make sure i’m staying alive. on top of that, i would want to be in a city with a viable music scene, but i figure the internet is becoming an increasingly powerful to to market oneself anyhow, so that’s a bit of a lesser priority.

i’ve been considering denver the most, but i’m well aware the rates can be a little high over there. i’ve also been thinking about phoenix and bakersfield, ca. i doubt i’ll be able to find a roommate anywhere i go so i’m hoping i can find somewhere to live by myself for a reasonable price.

what do y’all think?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
Will there be video taken of Ingenuity's flight on Mars? Edit: If anyone hasn't seen it yet, here is the official NASA video of Perseverance's Descent: https://youtu.be/4czjS9h4Fpg It is absolutely breathtaking.|Perseverance's Mastcam-Z and navigation cameras will attempt to take images and possibly video of Ingenuity's flight. - GT
How long do you hope/expect Perseverance to run for?|The Perseverance power source is an RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) that can last anywhere from 10-15 years. However, there are other elements of the rover (electronics, mechanisms) that may not last as long but given the longetivity we've seen in previous missions, we hope Percy keeps the tradition alive of outliving expectations! - ML
Are there types of microbial life you are expecting to find? How do you target where to land?|When we think about life detection on Mars, or anywhere in our solar system, the first step is to use our knowledge of life on Earth as a way to look for life as we know it. In this case, we are looking for signs of past life that could have lived environments on early Mars, and are using early Earth environments as analogies. So the rover will be looking for the types of rocks that we know are good to preserve these types of fossils on the early Earth, and collecting samples of these rocks for return. Of course, we are also interested in thinking about life as we don't know it, and so are keeping our minds open to what we think of as agnostic biosignatures for microbial life. - LH
 |Nina here, great question! The process of selecting a landing site begins years before we land. We have a series of meetings in which anyone in the Mars community (and sometimes beyond!) may propose a landing site using currently available data (usually from orbiting spacecraft that are already on Mars). They give a presentation explaining why the proposed landing site can address the key mission goals. So for Perseverance, we wanted to identify a place that could plausibly have been habitable—that is, a place where life as we currently understand it could have existed—and a place that could preserve evidence of past microbial life had it been present. Jezero is a fantastic place in which to look for both of these things because we believe it once was host to a long-lasting lake. Even more exciting is that there’s a preserved delta deposit, which on Earth is an *awesome* place in which to persevere biosignatures. Jezero crater has been studied from afar for many years, and it rose to the top during our team discussions as a great place in which to answer our top questions. --NLL
Why did the EDL system bank left instead of right? Seems like it banked away from the edge of the delta, when it could have easily banked right and landed in the flat area near the delta that seemed more landing friendly and closer to your target.|The EDL team is still reviewing the data we got back, and have not come to a firm conclusion about why TRN chose the left-ward divert option instead of the right-ward.
 |When watching the RDC footage, we were all surprised at how close we came to the friendly terrain under the big cliff that we've generally referred to as the """"Landing Strip,"""" but then chose to go elsewhere! I'm sure TRN had its reasons, but we're still trying to gain a better understanding about what went into that on-board decision. We have picked up some clues so far. For example, it seems like there was some wind pushing the vehicle toward the east (to the left) while hanging on the chute. -AN
I'm wondering about how the rover deals with dust. Especially since Mars has frequent dust storms. In particular how does Perseverance deal with the potential issue of its cameras and sensors getting obscured by dust? Is there a way it can clean them somehow? Oh, and I almost forgot; my most heartfelt congratulations to everyone involved in this mission for their efforts and success! It may not be the first mission of its kind, but I still see it as the true spirit of pioneering into the unknown.|Nina here, there is definitely a lot of dust on Mars! Unfortunately, we have no way of systematically removing dust on the rover, although we do have a gas-driven dust removal tool (sDRT) for removing dust on rocks. However, we are lucky that wind is a very important process on Mars, and we are likely to get free cleanings from Mars periodically. While dust isn’t great for optics, we’ve seen on previous missions that it hasn’t had a significant impact on our data acquisition. Fun fact: SuperCam’s laser makes a shock wave that clears dust from the surfaces of rocks, which helps us to get a dust-free analysis of the composition. – NLL

HI GUYS! IM SUPER PSYCHED FOR THIS. Congrats on the successful landing (I bullied my entire family into watching it with me)!! I have two questions: 1. I'm not really sure about this but I remember reading that MOXIE needed to heat up before releasing oxygen. Since it's technically in close proximity to Percy, which is powered by an RTG, is there any risk that it causes the RTG to overheat/explode/something like that?|No, the heat needed by MOXIE is provided by the electric power system of the rover. The rover power system and the insulation inside MOXIE are designed to prevent any ""overheating"" or other risk to the rover. – GT
2. I'm a high school student and I'm really interested in astronomy but people keep telling me that it's not a field of study worth going into because of how saturated it already is. Do you have any advise on how I can study a space science subject (preferably astrophysics)?|I was just like you; I loved astronomy and I was also told that it is highly saturated and that it's also tough to get a job. So just be sure to get a degree in physics as well. I did get a BS in both subjects, but did not get a PhD in astronomy as I was warned away from it. Another no-fail degree is computer programming if you want to add to your astronomy degree. We do have the James Webb Space telescope scheduled to launch this fall, so you never know what is going to happen in the future. – JC
How did you generate your “what-if” list of potential problems that would need to be overcome once the landing was successful? One of the most fascinating things about this mission is the vast number of potential problems that could occur. I’d love to know how you approached it. Sincere congratulations on an incredible feat of planning, collaboration and STEM excellence!|This is a great question! As a EDL systems engineer, this was one of my hardest tasks - how do you determine everything that *could* go wrong during landing and then how do you mean sure none of those things happen (or if they do happen - how do we make sure we can survive them). We start with requirements of what the system has to perform in order to land safely and make sure we test or analyze each of these requirements. We then take a step back and say, what else could go wrong? We then put together a document that looked at every time during landing and for each of the various subsystems (ex. GNC sensors, software errors, telecom) we worked through all of the possible things that we thought could go wrong and developed methods to analyze and test them. However, the scariest part of all of the is that you never know if there are ""unknown unknowns"" remaining in the system - which is a term engineers like to use for something hidden in the system that we haven't thought of. This is what keeps me up at night! However, the team was great and we performed over 300 different kinds of landing fault tests to ensure the system was robust. - ML
I watched part of the live stream today, you mentioned that there was over 30Gb of video and image data sent back. How does that work? My understanding is that the bandwidth is relatively small when sending data back to Earth so I cant imagine livestreaming 23 HD cameras back is the way to do that. For instance the video data from the crane platform - was that streamed to MRO or Percy and cached for future data transfer? Thanks and congrats on an awesome achievement. EDIT: Just thought, if you are caching the data, I assume Percy has a HDD or SSD. How big is that? Are there any easter eggs on that you sent with? I know there are some people putting images on rovers that are going to the moon, anything like that?|A key part of the EDL Cameras instrument is a small computer on the Rover called the Data Storage Unit (DSU). The DSU stored raw images from the 6 EDL Cameras (Rover Uplook, Rover Downlook, Descent Stage Downlook, and Parachute Uplook) and audio captured by the microphone.
 |We were able to compress the raw images into videos right there on Mars on the DSU, which cuts down dramatically on the data volume needed to send the products back to Earth for all of us to feast our eyes on!
 |We haven't yet received all the images yet, either, just the videos of the really top priority events. But with any luck, we'll continue getting back the full-res imagery over the coming months, as time and rover resources (like power and data bandwidth) allow. -AN
What is the best place to access the images, videos, and/or data sent back from Perseverance? Is there a dedicated webpage or portal that is accessible to the public?|Absolutely! All the raw images are being released here: https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/
 |Post processing images products are starting to appear on:
 |- Mars 2020 Multimedia page: https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/images/

Congrats on the successful landing and the incredible video! Are the up cameras on the rover still operational? Are there any plans to use them? (To an amateur astronomer they look like they could be a great sky cam!) I'll also give a shout out for the [Huygens lander which captured some decent video](https://sci.esa.int/web/cassini-huygens/-/39218-huygens-descent-to-titan-surface) on its way down to Titan :)|Yes, the Rover Uplook Camera from the EDL Cameras is still there and available if we want to use it! Problem is, there are so many other great imagers on the Perseverance rover to compete with! In fact, funny you should mention it, but there is a camera called SkyCam, made specifically for this purpose! That should get some science-quality images of the scenes above the rover. So stay tuned for those images later on! -AN
Perseverance will drill chalk-sized samples of soil/rocks and leave them behind for a future mission to collect. How do they ensure the samples do not get swept away in dust devils or storms?|Nina here, while we all remember how Mark Watney was stranded on Mars, it turns out that the Martian wind is not all that powerful. The atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s—the average atmospheric pressure on Mars is ~6 mbar pressure as compared to Earth’s 1 bar pressure at sea level. So even when the Martian wind is howling along at high speeds, there aren’t a lot of air molecules available to do work. This means that Mars wind can’t carry or even move heavy things like sample tubes, comms equipment, or even sand. Most wind-borne dust on Mars is really small, on the order of microns, for this reason. So I feel confident that our samples will be right where we left them, if slightly dustier. –NLL
This is a pretty broad question, but do you have any expectations for what you might discover? Or to put it another way, do you think you'll be surprised by what you find? The video/photos/audio are incredible! Thanks for doing what you do.|Nina here, one thing we can be sure of is that Mars has lots of surprises in store for us. Just when we think we know everything, Mars shows us something we never imagined. At Jezero, we have an opportunity to learn about a lot of different aspects of Mars: About the ancient environment as seen in the “basement” rocks in the crater, about the long-lasting lake system that followed it, and maybe if we’re exceedingly lucky, whether microbes ever existed on Mars. But of course, there are more things in Mars than are dreamt of in our philosophy—and that’s why I love discovery science! --NLL
What’s the next step if signs of microbial life are identified at some stage (by Percy, or a later mission)? Would you ever consider bringing a sample of them home to earth?|It would be wonderful to find signs of microbial life either by the Perseverance rover itself, or as part of the analyses that we hope to do with samples that we are collecting and planning to bring back to Earth. Through looking for the earliest signs of life here on Earth, we know that one of the most important things in looking for biosignatures is understanding the context, so that we are sure that signal we are looking at is actually created by life and not some non-life process. So the first step if we detected signs of microbial life would be to look for additional information to understand whether the samples we are looking for are actually what we think they are! -LH
At this point the Ingenuity (Mars Helicopter) schedule is for 5 test flights including the initial 3m hover flight for the first (AFAIK). Mars Helicopter team members and public documents detail the charging time as approximately a day under general sunlight conditions for recharging the helicopter's batteries for full charge. If the first 5 flights are successful, is there a planned extension of the Ingenuity flight schedule? If so, what would be some examples of destinations or objectives secondary to the original 5? Is there a priority of these next objectives? Rooting for all of you guys!|At this point there is no plan for extension of the mission beyond the maximum 5 flights, however, one option being considered for the 5th flight might be flying off to a new destination. – JR
This is so cool! Tell us about the landing. I hear in regular aerospace travel that takeoffs and landings are the most difficult part. Any surprises? Also, how will the specimens be handled? Are they going to be tested on site or brought back to Earth? Ifbrought back to Earth, how?|Nina here, I am SO EXCITED for sample return from Mars!! And the Perseverance sample caching is the first step in that goal. Perseverance has a fantastic suite of instruments that we’ll use to analyze materials within Jezero Crater to understand chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology. From those analyses, we’ll pick samples to cache for future pick up by a Mars sample return mission (the current plan for this mission is SO COOL and includes an orbiter, a lander, and an adorable fetch rover to get our sample tubes). So we’ll already know a lot about these samples before they get to our labs on Earth. Before they arrive, we’ll prepare super clean facilities that can receive them (similar to the sample curation facilities that we have for lunar samples). We also have a team of sample scientists who are already thinking about what kinds of samples we might want and what kinds of analyses we might do on them. – NLL

Hey guys! Congratulation on the successful landing of the rover. I've never been so excited about anything science related as I was during the live stream of the landing. I almost shed a tear. I have a few questions regarding the rover and some future plans. 1) Could you give clarification on the computer hardware and OS used on the rover? What kind of computing power are we looking at? What are the sizes of the Camera sensors and their resolution? what frame rate can the the cameras capture video? 2) Assuming the helicopter probe is a success, what kind of plans does NASA have for the current helicopter probe and future probes? Would it be possible for NASA to build a Perseverance sized flight-based rover to be created that could traverse large areas of the Planet, while being powered by the same power sources as Perseverance?|Q2 - A key reason why we do technology demonstrations such as Ingenuity is to expand our capabilities for future exploration. We certainly hope that, if successful, Ingenuity will pave the way for future aerial platforms that could enable us explore areas on Mars where rovers cannot go and to get closer views than can be obtained from orbit. And rotorcraft technology isn't just for Mars -- NASA is planning a mission to Saturn's moon Titan, which will send a multi-rotor vehicle powered by an MMRTG to fly in Titan's dense atmosphere with its entire science payload to different places across the surface. -LH
3) What kind of Organic Compounds is the Rover looking for that would point towards the past existence of life? would that be something the current rover be able to look at? Or would the samples it collect have to be transported back to Earth for that kind of analysis to happen? 4) What kinds of analysis can be done with the main camera system on the surface of mars? What kind of things can it detect? How well does it operate under low light conditions? what is the focal length of the camera? does it only take colour images, or can it take other kinds of images?|Q3 - Two instruments on the rover - SHERLOC and PIXL - will work together provide measurements of organic compounds along with geological context of any that are detected to carry out astrobiology investigations and search for signs of life. The biosignatures that we look for on the early Earth are similar to those organic compounds like those that Perseverance will be looking for with these instruments, but in returning samples, we will be able to make much more precise measurements of these compounds with instruments here on Earth. -LH
First of all, congrats! Those videos and pictures and audio. Wow. I'm as blown away as the dust just before the release. For my question: I was really inspired to consider going back to college to pick up another degree and aim for NASA because of Perseverance. What level of education did you folks end on before going to work in the space industry (Bachelor's/ Master's/ PhD) and what majors did you graduate with? Thank you folks for your time. And congrats once again! Those videos and hearing ""touchdown confirmed"" will always make me tear up.|It depends on the role you're hoping to fill at NASA. I went back to school in my late 20s, early 30s to get a Bachelors of Science in Astronautical Engineering before joining NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a Systems Engineering, a BS was enough to get started as most of the day to day work is really learned on the job. -Cj Giovingo
Will Perseverance sing itself a song on its birthday?|Curiosity was able to sing itself a birthday song on it's birthday by vibrating tubes within the SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) -- I was actually on shift for Curiosity on the day we sent the commands to play the happy birthday song! Perseverance brought a new set of instruments to Mars, and the instrument suite does not contain SAM, so I don't think we will be able to play any kind of song. However, our surface operations team is quite a creative and smart group of people, so they may be able to figure out something special to do for Percy's first birthday. – ML
For Ms. Abarca or anybody else who can answer it-What is the maximum data rate that can be sent back to Earth from the rover? Also, will you ever send signals back directly from Perseverance, or will you always use a relay orbiter?|Depending on the orbiter we use to transmit data we can sometimes get almost a gigabit of data in a pass! Orbiters like TGO and MAVEN are really game changers for us with the amount of data they can transmit for us. Particularly at the beginning of a mission we have a lot of orbiter coverage to complete our instrument and vehicle checkouts. We can talk directly to the rover with the Low and High Gain Antennas, but don't typically transmit instrument/camera data products due to the smaller data volume. – HA
Hi NASA! How did you program the rover, having in mind that it has to operate on its own? Did you use machine learning? I'm studying programming and would like to work for NASA in the future. Keep up the good work!|Hi! Once the rover is on the surface of Mars, we only communicate with it during a handful of orbiter overflights during the day, so we have to give Perseverance 24 hours worth of commands to execute and then she sends back information about how that day of commanding went. However, we are able to add some additional smarts to the system so it can make some decisions - for example, we have smart driving capabilities where we can provide Percy with a destination and allow her to find her own route there. We call this ""thinking while driving."" - ML
Congratulations on the landing!! I watched the footage earlier today and was surprised that, during the sky crane portion, you couldn’t actually tell that the crane’s engines were running from the video, even when it boosted away at the end. Why is that? Is it related to the thinner atmosphere on Mars?|Yes - you're on the right track! The reason you don't see any flames is due to the very thin atmosphere of Mars. The propellant plume (hydrazine) is made of N2, H2, and NH3. All of those are transparent gases. There isn't enough oxygen in the Martian atmosphere for these hot gases to react/burn with the plume – ML
When the rover drops samples for pickup later, will it drop them all in the same spot and how is that determined?|Multiple samples, collected at different times, will be dropped into at the same place, what we are calling a ""cache."" Where this cache will be, whether all samples will be deposited in a single cache or in multiple caches, and how many caches there might be are all dependent on what we find in the rocks that we find as we explore the surface, and our understanding of how easy it will be for the rover coming to pick up the samples. - LH
 |The strategy is to deposit a ""depot"" of samples close together, so that the future retrieval mission would only need to go to one place to pick up the samples. The future sample retrieval mission team is already working with Perseverance's team to map out potential depot sites along the notional exploration path that the science team envisions for Perseverance. - GT
How were the Bridles separated between the “sky crane” and the rover? Was there redundancies in place if the initial separation between descent and rover failed?|At the end of the sky crane maneuver, the bridles that are connecting the descent stage and rover are separated when we command pyrotechnics to initiate a guillotine like device that cut the cables. - ML
Will skycranes be used for anything else other than rovers? Would heavier vessels/structures be more suitable with a skycrane, or other more traditional configurations? Also, would there ever be a possibility to land astronauts with a skycrane? Probably wouldn't be the best choice, but it would be badass.|Not sure! Every time we design a new landing system we have to take into account the volume and mass of the payload we are attempting to deliver to the surface. And then we need to architect the landing system to accommodate the payload. For example, we found the airbag system that delivered the MER rovers to Mars did not scale well with the mass increase for Curiosity, so a new design (including Sky Crane) needed to be developed. This same process of reviewing existing and new EDL architectures is done on every mission to find the right set of EDL steps required to land safely. - ML
Hi, Perseverance team. Congratulations on your rover's successful touchdown in Jezero Crater and an overall successful mission so far! I am going to drop a hypothetical here: What would be the estimated time to beam a 90-second clip (or the full load of a single flight) of moderate resolution and frame rate from Ingenuity to Perseverance to MRO and back to your station on Earth?|Thank you so much. We are actually not planning to take video from Ingenuity's on-board cameras. However, we are planning to return photos from our on-board cameras. Return to Earth depends not only on Ingenuity's on-board resources, but also downlink scheduling by the Perseverance operations team; however, we will likely be able to return images within the day after each flight. -- JR
How many high resolution color cameras do you guys have? During the landing, i noticed that there was one below the rover (as you could see the thrust pushing the dust away) and one above the rover (as you could see the parachutes). I saw the panorama as well, must be a horizontal camera. How many other high res cameras, and at what angles?|There are so many cameras I even have a hard time keeping track of all of them.For the EDL Cameras specifically, there are 6 high-res color cameras: a Rover Uplook, a Rover Downlook, a Descent Stage Downlook, and 3 Parachute Uplook cameras.
 |Here are some more resources about the many cameras on Mars 2020: https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/cameras/ |https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346537343_The_Mars_2020_Engineering_Cameras_and_Microphone_on_the_Perseverance_Rover_A_Next-Generation_Imaging_System_for_Mars_Exploration

How in the hell did you get a helicopter to work in Mars' almost non-existent atmosphere?|I know, right?! The helicopter team used classic systems engineering -- breaking down all the key challenges into smaller problems to be solved. They worked with aerodynamic experts to design a rotor that could provide lift in the thin Martian atmosphere, and autonomous systems that could enable controlled flight. It also took a lot of testing on Earth in vacuum chambers that simulated the conditions of the Martian atmosphere. With all that testing and design, the team is confident that Ingenuity is poised to complete the first aerodynamic controlled flight on another planet. -- GT
So who gets to fly the helicopter? Or is it all done by a computer program?|The helicopter team will prepare the flight commands on Earth and transmit those to Ingenuity via the relay station on board Perseverance. Ingenuity will fly completely autonomously based on the commands send from the team. Like the rover, it is impossible to operate the helicopter in real time from Earth (such as by a joy stick) due to time it takes for radio signals to travel from Earth to Mars (11 minutes and 22 seconds on-way at the time of landing). - GT
Any chance you could confirm or refute this tweet? Some folks are pointing out that the colors are backwards on the J. https://twitter.com/Spacecomm_Joey/status/1363936680466644995|The answer is not ""JPL"", but good guess! Keep trying ;) -AN
How is Ingenuity going to handle high winds on Mars? Will it try to land near objects that can help divert wind, or does jezero crater not usually experience gusts like this? Amazing work as always! :D|Ingenuity has been designed to survive on the ground in high wind conditions. We also plan to fly during times of day with more favorable wind conditions, and Ingenuity has actually been through extensive testing on earth flying in those conditions at Mars atmospheric pressure. And, luckily, even though Mars can see some fairly high wind speeds, the effect of the wind on Ingenuity is lessened by the low atmospheric pressure. -- JR
So is the descent vehicle one and done? Did it continue to capture video as it flew away to safe distance?|Yes, the descent stage is only used one time. The Rover Uplook Camera did capture video of the descent stage flying away but did not capture when the it crashed into the surface a safe distance away. - CG
How does the copter know its position? No gps there.|Ingenuity is able to estimate its position through a combination of on-board inertial and visual sensors. – JR
I thought it was cool that you were able to use the EDL microphone to speak in the press conference today. What were the design considerations like for a microphone that would function in a low pressure environment like Mars and how does it differ from one we might use here on Earth?|The main thing we had to consider for all the commercial-off-the-shelf hardware for the EDL Cameras &amp; Microphone was preparing the hardware for the space environment.
 |The hardware has to withstand a lot of thermal cycling on Mars (very hot, then very cold, over and over again), radiation from the sun, and vibrations and shock loads during launch and EDL. So the major focus was on making sure the sensors, electronics, and cabling could continue to perform despite taking such a beating!
 |We also had to make sure this instrument would ""Do No Harm"" to the rest of the flight system so it would land safely, so we spent a lot of time and effort checking on that. For example, making sure the electrical signals in the instrument don't interfere with critical transfer of data all over the system. – AN
Volunteer Solar System Ambassador for NASA’s JPL here. I’ve received this question from quite a few people and am excited to learn the answer. Will Ingenuity stay with Perseverance at all times, or will they travel separately?|Yes, during its mission of up to 5 flights, Ingenuity will stay within communications range of Perseverance. – JR
Will we be able to download the raw video footage from the website anytime soon (individual camera views)? Would they be made available compressed and re-encoded as well?|Stay tuned! It's coming! -AN
Can you please describe how the rover's **radioisotope thermoelectric generator** (RTG) is designed to shield Mars or future Mars human explorers from the radiation of the onboard nuclear material and what design considerations were given (what expertise) you drew upon for that design? Thank you.|Radioisotope power systems have been successfully and safely used by NASA to explore the solar system for nearly 50 years, including the Mars Curiosity rover and Viking landers and the Apollo science packages that the astronauts took to the moon. The radioisotope fuel in Perseverance's RTG predominantly emits alpha particles--a type of radiation that travels for less than two inches in air and is easily stopped, by as little as a sheet of paper or the outer layer of skin. The surface of Mars is bathed in harsh radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar radiation, so future exploration systems will need to be designed to protect human explorers from that natural radiation. – GT
It was stated by NASA that it takes around 11 minutes to receive data from the rover on Mars, does that apply to all types of data? If not, how long does it take for an image to arrive at Mission Control? (an image of the resolution that has been received so far).|The amount of time it takes to receive data is limited, as in all things, by the speed of light, just like your cell phone or your radio. So, 11 minutes 22 seconds is how long it takes at the speed of light to travel from Earth to Mars for the current relative positions of the two planets. Just like a racetrack with a runner on the inside lane and a runner on the outside lane, the distance between them changes. For Mars to Earth, the signal can take as long as 23 minutes. For the Voyager spacecraft at the edge of the heliosphere, long beyond Pluto, the time to send a signal one-way is like 21 hours right now. You can see the range time to ""phone home"" at our Deep Space Network Now website in real-time: https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html – JC
I’m a freshman Aerospace engineering student. I was absolutely amazed by the videos and photos that were shown on the live stream today. How can I end up where you guys are right now? In college, what areas of expertise should I try to focus in? Are there any skills you want college graduates to have but find many lack? I’m really interested in programming and can write simple programs in python. I’d love to learn more about how the Terrain-Relative Navigation and how the rover uses the images from the Hazcams to be able to identify possible hazards and then create a safe route around them. How can I learn more about the exact logic and image processing being used? Are there any small projects that I could feasibly do at home with a raspberry pi and some other electronics? Thank you! :)|Computer science is an excellent field to get into if you are interested in working on future missions! I highly recommend applying for NASA summer internships as you can truly learn so much. (That's how I was lucky enough to get where I am today!)
 |Re Hazard Cameras: We heavily rely on our hazard and navigation cameras for drive planning and robotic arm operations. For some more information on the Mars 2020 Engineering Cameras: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-020-00765-9. -HA
You said that Perseverance will collect and drop samples so they can be brought back to Earth. But conditions on Mars are very harsh. How will the samples be protected? What will be done to make sure they survive until they can be picked up?|All of the collected samples will be put into sample tubes before they are dropped, and a lot of planning and testing have gone into understanding what would happen with the sample tubes that are deposited on the surface! These tubes are sealed after the samples are collected so that the samples will be contained and protected while they sit on the surface waiting for collection and all the way on their trip back to Earth. -LH
Is there any functional difference between the 2 microphones on Perserverance? Or are there 2 simply for redundancy if one were to break? If there is a difference how will that difference enable further scientific discoveries?|Nina here, I love our two mics! Perseverance has two of them, one to capture sounds of entry, descent, and landing (EDL) and another on the SuperCam instrument to capture the sounds of our rock-vaporizing laser (really!). I’m most familiar with the SuperCam mic since I work on that instrument. SuperCam includes a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument that uses a laser to obtain chemistry information. We can shoot rocks up to 23 feet (7 m) away from the rover. When the laser hits the rock, we vaporize a tiny amount of material (micrograms) into a bright plasma, which expands outward and produces a shock wave. It’s less of a ""pew-pew"" and more of a ""snap-snap"" =] But it turns out that we can learn about the rock’s material properties by listening to the laser snapping sound, including things like rock hardness, how deep our laser is penetrating, and also whether there are rock coatings present. I like rock coatings because they are a fantastic place to study interactions between the rock, water, atmosphere, and potentially life. – NLL
Congrats on an amazing mission so far! A couple questions: 1. Now that the skycrane has worked successfully for both Curiosity and Perseverance, is the technology being considered for use on other missions? 2. Perseverance is looking for signs of ancient life, but is there any chance at all that there's microbial life somewhere on Mars today? Even if there isn't, what are some key signs that life, no matter how small, exists or used to exist on Mars? Thanks and congrats again! Can't wait to see what this mission does in the future|Whether we use a sky crane type system for a future mission all depends on what that mission's needs are going to be. Mission designers consider all the different options and capabilities available to meet the requirements. Sky crane was particularly useful for Curiosity and Perseverance because it provided a way for the rovers to land on their wheels, ready to explore. Future missions might have other considerations that might make a platform lander (such as Phoenix and InSight) more useful. As for seeking signs of life, the scientific consensus is that the surface of Mars is too harsh an environment (too cold, dry, and bathed in harsh radiation) for life to exist today. However, it might be possible that deep underneath the surface, beyond the reach of radiation, and perhaps where liquid water might be, that might be a potential habitable environment. Perseverance is designed to explore the ancient rocks in Jezero Crater, looking for potential biosignatures (chemicals, minerals, structures, or organic molecules) that might have been preserved from 3.5 billion years ago when the surface of Mars was warmer, wetter, and more conducive for microbial life. – GT
what's the best advice you could give to a high school senior to try to get in this field?|To build and operate a mission like this, we need a team of all sorts of people! Not only do we need every type of scientist and engineer, but we also need lawyers, business managers, media experts, photographers, accountants, etc. My best piece of advice for you is to figure out what you like to do and then find a way to apply that to areas that interest you. Mars missions are full of passionate people working together, so if you are passionate about what you are doing - you'll fit right in. - ML
Does ingenuity have a turtle mode? so if it lands on it's side is it able to right itself?|Unfortunately, no. - GT
As a photographer I got some camera questions. How are the cameras on perseverance different compared to cameras on previous missions? Will we be seeing more video in the future or will it be time lapse videos based on images? What is being done to protect the cameras from the dust on Mars?|For Curiosity, InSight, Spirit, and Opportunity we had 1 megapixel black and white engineering cameras. The Mars 2020 Engineering cameras are now 20 megapixel color cameras! There are 25 cameras between this mission and the Ingenuity helicopter that will be sending back incredible data these next few years! The Mastcam-Z cameras have the capability to capture video, so stay tuned for that! Fun fact: we're always careful to leave our cameras pointing slightly down so that they do not collect dust. -HA
This may be a dull one or bad one but, what was going through your heads while the rover was going to Mars? Did you expect Aliens?|After the spacecraft launched and was cruising towards Mars, I was mainly focused on all of the things we needed to do to get the spacecraft ready for landing. Once we launch, the team has to make sure all of the hardware survived the launch environment and that both of the spacecraft computers are set up properly for landing. Additionally, the team is also prepping the team for landing and making sure everyone knows that their exact role and responsibilities are on landing day. So it is quite a lot of work to get done in a short amount of time - I think the team doesn't have much time to focus on anything else besides make sure we land safely! - ML
Where can I find the Perseverance rover landing simulation?|Hi, you can re-live the thrilling landing here: https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/mars2020/#/home.

They have subjected me to severe emotional and psychological abuse, to the point where I am extremely uncomfortable even mentioning mental health or sexuality to them, and I have severe anxiety even being in a room with just the three of us. I want to seek therapy, but I can't bring it up to them. They have claimed that they were going to get me therapy *multiple* times when I brought up feeling suicidal, or suffering from depression, anxiety, and self harm, but they never have, besides sending me to a pastor one time. They believe that they are great parents, and try to turn my siblings against me by telling them I'm an arrogant, stuck-up, and horrible person, who is mean to them for no reason. They've also told this to people outside of our family as well. My mother has also been sharing sensitive information about me without my consent, even after asking me if it was ok, and me telling her no, she does it anyway. I've resented them for a long time, but in the past year or so, I've started talking to them less and less and refused to spend time with them, especially alone. I am no longer comfortable interacting with them, but they act like it's just me being a jerk without any cause. And any time I brought up what they had done, they gaslight me and claim I'm making stuff up, even though I have taken the time to document every major incident in my journal. According to them, they are ""always in my corner"" and love me very much, and always try to do what's best for me.  For clarification I'm a16 year old asexual boy. I am currently in my last year of pursuing an associate's degree. My hope is to transfer to an out of state college, because that's the only way I'll be able to move out as soon as possible.

Do any of you know a way to get therapy in secret? I really need it, but I'm scared to try with my parents knowledge.

Here is a list of other posts I've made about some of the incidents that have occurred between us, my story, and content that I've never posted before, but kept in my journal:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/md8aor/acephobic\_parents\_rant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/md8aor/acephobic_parents_rant/)

In one incident, she was yelling at me about something that wasn't even my fault, right before I had to go to an virtual intern orientation, and I had to try and act like I was ok on camera while trying not to cry in the middle of an anxiety attack. I was scratching the top of my left hand with one of my fingers in a repetitive motion, and I was shaking. Half way through the meeting and I realized that I had scratched the skin off in that spot and it was bleeding. I didn't do it on purpose, I was in the middle of an anxiety attack and I wasn't paying attention. After the meeting I covered my hand and went to the bathroom to put a band-aid on. I didn't tell them because I was terrified of how they would react, remembering their reactions to when I self harmed and my mental health in general. Of course they wound up noticing the band-aid. They were saying I did it on purpose and I was being deceitful by hiding it because I knew I was wrong. My mother refused to speak to me for a while and they took my bedroom door away for 3 months. And made me apologize to them. And although I already suffered from depression and wanted to die at the time, they had a part in me deciding to kill myself on my own, instead of hoping to die.

When I was 8, they found the Netflix and Hulu watch history filled with the most pornographic and obscene movies ever made. Naturally they blamed their 8 year old son for watching them. And then my brothers who had a long history of making stuff up about me, claimed that I would wake them up in the middle of the night and make them watch it with me.  Even though they had no idea of what was in it when asked(They later told me they made it all up because they thought it was funny). And my parents beat me with electrical cords trying to get me to admit to it, and threatening to send me away. My mother even talked about shooting me to death, because I was a danger to their children. I already suffered from severe depression at this point, so that pushed me over the edge. That was the first time I've thought about taking my life myself, and it's been so ever since. Funny how years later the *same thing* happened where Netflix watch history had strange and pornographic movies in it, and they realized someone else was using our account. They changed the password and it stopped. Wonder why that logical reason didn't come to mind all those years ago."
mdgvy9,702,2021-03-26,"At the Beginning of 11th Grade, I Almost Dropped Out of High School. Today, I got into UC Berkeley!",KTnash,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mdgvy9/at_the_beginning_of_11th_grade_i_almost_dropped/,"Let me first preface this by saying that I am incredibly privileged to have had the educational opportunities I’ve had.

The beginning of high school was exciting: I was accepted into one of the best schools in my city, an all girls school and I thought it would provide me with the best possible education. I was wrong. In order to make the bus to go to that school, I had to wake up at 5:00 am. I would have been fine if I didn’t have what I could only describe as “busy work” until 1:00 am almost every night. I was bullied at this school too. It wasn’t new, I had been bullied before and I was happy my first year because I had good friends.

In between my freshman and sophomore years, all but a few of my friends left this school. The bullying worsened to the point where I didn’t do any school ECs because I didn’t feel comfortable around many of my classmates. I had a horrible experience with a teacher (I later got her fired... a story for another time). I made the decision to leave and found a new school. 

After an amazing summer, I went to this new school and immediately knew it was a horrible fit. Due to differing credits, I was in almost all of my classes with kids two years younger than myself and the general vibe of this school was really immature (at that point, I had already traveled on my own, held a paying job, and an internship). My mental health plummeted to a dangerously low point. I was hopeless. I didn’t want to tell my parents how miserable I was because I had just switched schools. I thought there was something wrong with me. The final straw was when a teacher pointed out my (admittedly really bad) acne to the entire class and asked if I was okay, thinking I’d been in a fight or something. I was utterly humiliated. I wanted to disappear. After that I couldn’t think straight. I almost ruined my entire life at that point but I didn’t because I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents. 

I honestly believed that high school didn’t work for me. I was extremely close to dropping out, getting my GED, and starting community college. At this point, I thought it would be impossible for me to ever get into a top school. Who would want to take the kid that bounced around schools and eventually dropped out?! However, by complete chance, I discovered a tiny little school. I enrolled on a trial basis. It was the best decision I ever made! Within a month, I was pretty much the happiest I’d ever been and, for the first time, I felt intellectually challenged in high school! I got involved. I had friends. It was a dream come true for me! I will be graduating from this amazing place in just a few short months; however, I know I will stay very involved at my “forever high school.”

Today, I got into UC Berkeley. It still feels surreal as I write this. Cal was my dream school for three years and, when I was contemplating dropping out, I pretty much said goodbye to that dream. I was always a straight a student, but grades don’t tell the full story and bullying can have horrible effects on people. I lost all my confidence because of bullying. I am still working on getting it back. But I wanted to share this story for anyone else who, despite being high performing academically, has struggled in high school, or to any victims of bullying. We are valid and it gets better. 

To conclude, please be nice to everyone and never give up! I didn’t give up and I’m here today! I still can’t believe it! If your still reading, thank you for your interest in my story. 

TL;DR: Being bullied and not fitting in destroyed my confidence to the point where I almost dropped out. I tried one more school and got into Cal! Be nice to everyone!"
mdh05f,3,2021-03-26,Crypto Internship?,Dirtpickl,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mdh05f/crypto_internship/,"I'm a student at a university in the California Bay Area, unfortunately, I've had some health issues recently that have sucked up a lot of my time, and forced me to miss a large portion of the prime application period for internships around the bay.  I'm now looking for crypto internships and frankly don't really know where to start.

One serious issue that I've encountered are many internships looking for CS and Engineering majors for analyst roles that I as a Finance major cannot fill.

So I suppose my question to y'all is if you are familiar with any companies (funds, blockchain startups, assorted crypto fintechs, etc...) that are either still looking for interns, or never looked for interns but would be open to having one if I offered?

Note: I'm not looking for just established internship programs, I'd be perfectly happy to intern in any any official or un-official capacity.

Thanks for the advice!"
mdhs13,3,2021-03-26,"First job offer out of college is SDET, with competitive offer. Should I decline and keep gunning for SDE role?",amazing-tony,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mdhs13/first_job_offer_out_of_college_is_sdet_with/,"Hey everyone, so I graduated in June 2020 with a bachelors and have been job searching since then. Anyway, I did multiple interviews to no luck. 

Recently, my lucks been flipping. I’ve gotten a lot more call backs and multiple mid-final stage interviews. I finally ended up getting an SDET offer with a very competitive offer (between 115-130k). I’m also in a final round interview with another company for a Java developer role, but based on their budget I think I can probably get about 105k. I don’t think they’d match. 

Anyway, the offer I have is pretty sweet, and the company seems to be high growth. However, I’ve heard horror stories of being pigeonholed into SDET and am not sure if I should steer clear. 

Now I know most will say to do what I enjoy. However, I’ve never had a SDE internship and have never worked as an SDET so I honestly don’t know if I’d hate SDET. 

I’ve mentioned to my managers that eventually I want to be in a position where I have the option to try a pure SDE role on the backend team. And they’re all on board to support me with that transition in the future, provided that I excel at the SDET role. However, there is no guarantee, obviously. 

Anyway, should I pass a very competitive offer for SDET(even higher than all my SWE new grad friends), basically to be safe from future pigeonholing and make my career trajectory easier to land higher paying jobs? 

Should I take my (future) managers support to help me find the right team internally after a year or so, with a grain of salt? Is it just facade to lure me in? 

Also, if I do end up getting an SDE offer, it will likely be around 90-105 range. About 20k less than my current offer. 

Thanks!"

I got an offer to do an apprenticeship and work half the time in a company and the rest would be another front end course (even though I'm already prepared it has to have a course job aside).

But because of this apprenticeship the salary would only be $960 (17 days/months) which is very low based on the country I'll work in (France)

Should I take this position ?

I know it will be hell of a pain to find a company that will hire me because I have no degree and only an internship as work experience so I'm saying maybe gaining a bit more experience and taking this position could be benefit for the future.

This lovely girl works her ass off for almost 50 hours a week, working both a parttime job and trying to complete an intense masters for urban planning. On top of that, she worries about her father's declining health as he isn't in very good shape and drinks a lot.

She's feeling like the world was just swept under her legs and probably wants to stay in bed for a month. I can imagine that these times must feel incredibly chaotic and like life is unfair. She feels like she's only been getting worse, and hasn't progressed at all. With that, she feels ashamed of moving back in with her parents again. 

However, I don't want her to become bitter or resentful or to miss the positive things in her life that she has and will eventually see again. I would find it sad for her to decline in a downward spiral or to be stuck in a victim's mentality. I also don't want to push her into seeing things differently, or to make her feel like her feelings don't matter because they do. I am very proud of her and I can honestly say that I love her.

At the same time, I have been struggling with the whole pandemic myself and have been feeling down sometimes as I live by myself. I've also recently started an internship in a workfield (UX) that I am new to and that takes up a lot of energy and effort. So I try to blow steam off by sporting, gaming every now and then and spending time with my girlfriend and friends as well. And while I try to support her the best I can, sometimes I feel like I need a little support too. I already contacted my therapist about this, and am patiently awaiting her comment. 

How I handle things from here? She knows that I am there for her but sometimes she feels like the things I say don't help her or that she doesn't want to think about positive things because she just feels like shit for now. I can imagine that, yet at the same time I know the dangers of staying in this negative place for too long myself. She has a lot of things in life that she is grateful for, yet it probably doesn't feel like thst for her in this moment. 

Any advice or help or tips at all are appreciated. Thanks in advance and have a great day."

mdlwhg,4,2021-03-26,MS CS after graduation with a non-CS engineering degree or go on to work?,aeroespacio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mdlwhg/ms_cs_after_graduation_with_a_noncs_engineering/,"I'm an aerospace engineering major at a top engineering and CS school. I additionally minor in computer science, and I've taken most of the core classes. Think algos, systems, arch, data structures, discrete structures etc. I graduate in a few weeks with my major and minors.

Late last year, I applied to several MS CS programs thinking that I had a good shot. I've so far received an acceptance from a university that is decently good for CS (Rutgers), but I've been rejected from a couple of my top choices. I'm waiting to hear back from three schools that would be considered extremely good for CS, but I've started to think about alternative plans since I have a hunch that I'll get denied from all three.

One potential path I could take is work a cushy SWE job in an aerospace/government company/org and easily balance Georgia Tech's OMSCS. I'm interested in systems/security, and I know OMSCS has a systems concentration. In terms of getting a job, I've thankfully had some great internships, and I have some strong connections with prestigious and well-known aerospace companies - no worries on that front.

However, a part of me still feels that I might pigeonhole myself into defense jobs if I go forward with my AE bachelor's. I'm also not completely sure about OMSCS' value in industry, especially if I'm not already working in tech or similar. My thinking is that an in-person, research-based MS would reset my career field and undergrad degree, provide me a research platform to concretely develop my systems/security specialization with, and give me a launchpad to all industries instead of just the aerospace one. I also have the impression that it might let me go past just simple implementational work in industry and do more interesting stuff. Lastly, it's very tempting to get my formal education out of the way before I try to go out into industry full-time.

I'm well aware of opportunity costs, but I am thankfully in a spot where I do not need to consider them much. I'm more concerned about making the choice that would be optimal for my career, allow me to work on more interesting things, and give me the most flexibility. Please let me know your thoughts; be as harsh as you'd like if I'm being very dumb. I'm happy to answer questions. Thanks!"

Before moving I quit my last job due to ""Pandemic Stress"" and misalignment of interests with shareholders. Rural living has helped me overcome that over the last few months. Job opportunities in the new location seem to be few and far between, mostly related to tourism, and I have only been actively searching for employment for the last 6 weeks. 

I have 4 years experience in international B2B sales and management for a small business (5 employees) as well as 10+ years in retail/customer service in other companies. Many of the skills and knowledge I possess I regards as highly transferable from one industry to the next as sales, management and customer service are an integral part of all businesses. Though no completed college degree, I have 2 years of Business Studies and 4 years in Criminology.

I have had 2 interviews so far with companies, one for a position as a Key Account Manager for a large corporation with a decent salary and higher than my previous jobs provided. For this I was interviewed twice. Unfortunately I got a call back from them to say they had filled the position with another candidate, which I was rather disappointed about since the job seemed good, with benefits that interested me. At least they had the decency to call back. 

My second interview was yesterday with a purchasing and logistics office for the fruit trade, who were offering a position as an ""Assistant Commercial"", essentially an entry level position I would gladly accept had I no previous work experience. The salary is abismal though they promise room for growth. By abismal I mean it is only marginally higher than what would be offered at a fast-food restaurant or supermarket clerk. It is a position I would assume fit for someone fresh out of college with no experience or an intern. The company culture seemed good and both the interviewers were very down to earth and friendly.

I am in no dire economical position at the moment and can probably extend the job hunting experience another month until the situation will become stressful, but I am worried that there will be a lack of opportunities that could provide me with a) the fulfillment and career progress I desire and b) a salary that I can live off comfortably.

I guess my question is: Should I swallow my pride, accept the low paying job and risk resenting my employer for not valuing what I bring to the table, or should I take the chance and extend my job search in hopes that they will recognize my potential and move up the ladder so to speak? It's only been 3 months since my last job and as I understand it my employ-ability will decrease from the 6 month mark onwards."

It has been some time now that I have been checking reddit posts about people who are just as confused as I am, my main searches included 'I hate computer science' and 'MBTI careers'.

I have almost graduated in Computer Science (data engineering/data science specialisation) and even though a promising career lies ahead of me, I feel like I'm missing something. There have been many many times where I have found myself crying in front of the computer. You see, I think unconsciously everytime I receive an error on my screen I feel like I have failed, and as a computer science student I have seen many errors, so you can probably imagine how I feel. Slowly I started getting better at what I do, but it is just inevitable to get errors on your screen. In the posts that I have read many said 'don't worry, it will get better, you will learn', but what if I don't want to get better, what if I think I am going to be very unhappy everytime I will open my computer and will feel like a piece of me dies inside. 

Another advice I have seen many times is, 'follow your heart ' or 'follow your dreams', while this is a piece of very lovely sounding advice, I feel like it is simple to say this but a lot harder to actually be able to make a living. 

I have several things in my life that I absolutely love doing:

\- I love cooking and baking  
\- I love designing and sewing clothes  
\- I love writing songs and making music  
\- I would love to own a small bed&amp;breakfast with a vineyard (my in-laws already own a vineyard but it's too small to make a living of only that)

I have considered getting a corporate job (in data analytics) after my graduation whilst keeping the above as hobbies, but then again I wonder why would I, why can't I just try to make a living doing one of those things. I have been an intern twice, working in data analytics/data science and dreaded every day I had to go to work, during the day I would try to find every excuse to not do what I had to be doing and once I arrived back home I felt depressed and cried. I don't want to repeat this, I don't want to live a life where I am slowly dying inside every day. But I don't know where to start, it's not as if someone is just going to gift me a B&amp;B or offer me a job as a pastry chef, and neither do I know if that would truly make me happy without trying. 

As you can read I am confused, I would love to get some advice from you. Please feel free to share whatever you have to say :)"

My graduation date is 2022 March. I have 3 years of OPT 

I have 2 choices,

1-) Right now, I'm in a marketing analyst internship in an aluminum company. Yesterday boss said to me they want to hire me, they can get the H-1B and green card in the future with no problem. Also, he says that "" it is easy to reach $100k/year salary in around 2 years. Is this really possible? Can he fool me by saying he will apply for a green card? 

2-) Finish internship here around July, Study more and more until graduation, and find a data science job. And continue from there without a visa guarantee. 3 years of experienced data scientists can also get something around $100k/year. As I see from today, 3 years of experienced data scientist will find a job anywhere in the US

Working 3 years with a lower salary ( I'm assuming the aluminum company is not going to give 100k) but get the green card VS finding a job in my field and compete with other people to convince the company to apply for a green card for me.

What would be your decision? Thank you very much."

Hi I'm a HS Senior recently just got accepted into these schools. I want to do hardware but also a bit of software if possible, so I'm a bit leaning towards CE major. I also want somewhere with high internship/job opportunity.

**UCSD**

Pros

* in-state tuition
* more internship/job available around SD (or so I heard)
* Californian weather

Cons

* EE not CE (although idk how hard it is to transfer between the two)
* Not as high-ranking as UIUC (doesnt really matter tho)

mdq72f,238,2021-03-26,Make Me Hate Carnegie Mellon,37scrub,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mdq72f/make_me_hate_carnegie_mellon/,"I always see this kind of post, and a lot of the ones I see for Carnegie Mellon have things that are wrong. I wrote about a these misconceptions a while ago, but the post ended up being really positive towards CMU.

**So, with decisions coming up, I’ve decided to make an accurate hate post.**

\*Disclaimer: if you are considering coming to CMU, don’t let this post dissuade you, I’m just presenting some of the worst aspects of the school. Personally, I find that the pros far outweighs the cons, and I am really happy here.\*

Also, some of these are not CMU-specific, but I included them because I feel like they exist much more at CMU than at most other universities.

In no particular order:

1. **The work / work-life balance:** This is hands down the worst thing about CMU. It is so insanely hard. I came in thinking it wouldn't be so bad because I took a ton of AP and College courses in high school, but I was dead wrong. Prepare to spend most of your time doing work. The amount of time i spent on school+ECs+volunteering+sports+research in high school is about the same amount of time I spend on just schoolwork here at CMU. Additionally, the rigor is unavoidable, as it is built right into the curriculum. I've heard from many people who have attended CMU and another school that CMU is far more time consuming, and takes a LOT more work. It also doesn't really matter what major you are, I've heard people say ""Well I'm super busy, I'm a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ major"", with so many different majors. You could insert literally any major in that blank and have it be a true statement.
2. **The food:** The meal plan for freshman is so expensive, and the food is generally unhealthy, or tastes terrible. I've had my fair share of food poisoning, and have found plastic in my food an unusually high number of times. Thankfully, you can get off the meal plan after the first year, but the meal plan is current the largest cost for me.
3. **Difficulty of transferring to some majors:** It is of a reasonable difficulty to transfer into some majors, but for others (CS, ECE, Drama, etc.) it is very difficult, especially if you are not already in the college that the major is housed in. Additionally, sometimes even if you meet the requirements of the transfer, you may be denied because of a lack of space. This is sad, because if you find out once you get to college that your true calling is not the major you were admitted for, you may be out of luck :(.
4. **Applying to double majors/minors:** To get into some double majors or minors here, you have to apply. For most of these programs, this is an easy process, and most everyone gets accepted. But there are a couple are much more difficult. For example, the HCI additional major only has an acceptance rate of around 50% (which sounds like a lot, but remember that you're competing against other CMU students). Also, some majors are not available as double majors, so if you want to study two things, there may be a lengthier transfer process (for example, if you want to study business and information systems: there is a business additional major, but not an IS additional major. So instead of just adding an IS double major, you would have to transfer departments from business to IS, and then apply for the double major in business. Not really a hard process, but definitely an unnecessary hassle).
5. **W E A N  H A L L:** I feel that most of campus is really beautiful, but [Wean is just so ugly.](https://www.cmu.edu/osher/publications/weekly-essentials/2019/2019-images/wean-2019.jpg)
6. **Certain Professors:** A lot of my professors here are absolutely amazing, but some of my professors are so horrendously bad, I've dropped their class and I absolutely dread taking it in the future. Thinking about them really makes me just want to 😀👊.
7. **The internship kids:** This certainly isn't a CMU thing, but it has happened to me way too many times. Some of the people here make their internship (or the process of getting an internship) their entire personality. They will 1. put you down for not having an internship, 2. make fun of where you are interning, 3. put you down for not praising them on their internship. One instance that really triggered me was this one kid raising his voice to talk about his upcoming internship interview while everyone around him was just trying to quietly study— Miss girl, please sit down, it's just an interview, and I'm just trying to do homework, go seek validation elsewhere.
8. **Superiority complex kids:** THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY AHHHHHHHHHH. Again not a CMU specific thing, but some people will go out of their way to put you down or look down on you FOR NO REASON AT ALL. For example, I was taking to a fellow ECE major yesterday, discussing which ECE track we might focus on. I said that I'd probably do software, but that I also really loved hardware. And he felt the need to tell me that I ""OnLy WaNt To Do HaRdWaRe BeCaUsE iT's EaSy"" even tho the hardware class is literally the hardest core class in the curriculum... Miss girl we are in the same major please stop putting me down because I HAVE INTERESTS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS. I am still triggered about this exchange. Also all those people that say that you only got in/got an internship/got into a program because of your gender/race.
9. **Inferiority complex kids:** Again not a CMU specific thing, and definitely a less common thing amongst students, but I have met some people who, upon meeting them, feel the need to explain why they don't go to a different top school. For example, on the same day that internship interview kid from 7., another girl decided that she must raise her voice and explain to no one in particular why she doesn't go to Stanford. Again, Miss Girl, I'm just trying to get my work done here.
10. **Lack of diversity:** Appalling. [Diversity? Never heard of her](https://www.cmu.edu/ira/Enrollment/pdf/fall-2018-pdfs/university-facts-2018-student-enrollment-by-citizenship-race-sex.pdf).
11. **Some lack of gender equality:** This definitely varies among majors, but some majors have really terrible gender distributions. SCS is great with 50% women, but ECE only has 28% women. Overall, the class of 2024 is the third admitted class in history that was at least 50% female.
12. **Cost:** It's really freaking expensive. Personally, CMU gave me a lot of financial aid and was one of the cheapest schools I got into, but if you're international or don't get financial aid— yikes. The price tag is incredibly steep.
13. **Pittsburgh Weather:** Gross. Rain. Clouds. Nice weather gives me serotonin but I really don't get much of that here. It's significantly better than my hometown, but still majorly yuck.
14. **Lack of School Spirit:** Literally no one cares about the sports. I feel like people are generally proud of CMU, but there is little to no school spirit in terms of sports. Also most of our teams suck.
15. **Extreme Imposter Syndrome:** This is something pretty much everyone experiences. I hear people say really often: ""You either have imposter syndrome, or you're an asshole"". Prepare to feel inadequate constantly. I never experienced imposter syndrome in my life until I began classes here. Any sort of ego or self-esteem is quashed a few weeks in.
16. **Prestige of Major Choice:** [Again, not really a CMU specific thing, but since some majors are more exclusive than others, some majors can be looked down upon, even if they are just as difficult/rigorous.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/jfyiv/how_i_feel_as_a_nonececs_major_at_cmu/)
17. **Major Choice:** Again, not a CMU specific thing, but some majors have much stronger departments than others, and it's a pretty weird mix. For example, we have really strong engineering/cs departments, and a really strong fine arts department. To a slightly lesser extent, we also have a really strong business program. But this makes CMU have a very weird (but not necessarily bad?) vibe. We are like an engineering school but an art school at the same time? But like also a general university? I don't think I explained this right, but we just have a weird mix of strong programs (not necessarily a bad thing, but yeah).
18. **Stress Culture/**[Top 3 Most Depressed](https://humansofuniversity.com/university-life/top-50-colleges-with-the-most-depressed-student-bodies/)**:** Again not a CMU specific thing, but something we really excel at. Stress culture is huge. I think it is also perpetuated by the sheer rigor of most of the programs here. I feel like it just exists over the whole university, including professors. I just don't think my professors sleep. I have sent multiple emails multiple times to multiple professors at 2am-4am, and they respond in like 5 minutes. Why are they awake? Why am I awake? I know a lot of people (like everyone lol) here who put school before their personal and mental health, which really shouldn't be happening. ~~Although I will say, the shared pain creates a beautifully collaborative and supportive environment.~~
19. **Academically Difficult— Low GPA:** As stated earlier, CMU is very rigorous, but also very hard. There is a lot of work to do, but the work is also hard work. This usually results in really low GPAs. This can be a hinderance later on— especially if you are applying to med school, or another graduate program that heavily considers GPA.
20. **Kinda sorta maybe kills passion:** This is kind of a hot take, but I think CMU sort of kills people's passions, but I don't think it is necessarily the school's fault. I know a lot of people who come in super interested in one major/topic, and end up doing something else (software) or modifying it (cs minor) for reasons other than their interests changing. CMU has very attractive post-graduation outcomes and salaries for ECE and CS, so I find that a lot of people will study these things to some extent. For example, pretty much all ECE majors will focus in software, even though there are 4 other really interesting tracks— I even find myself drifting towards the software track, even though I'm more interested in hardware because of the $$ ECE software salaries. Also, some people come in with the explicit intention of transferring, or double majoring, or declaring a different major, so you end up with students across the university in all different schools and all different majors pursuing essentially the same thing.
21. **Questionable Leadership/Grenell:** This has been discussed extensively on r/cmu.

That is all I can think of for now, but I hope this was helpful! I love being here at CMU and there are a LOT of reasons to come here, but it is definitely NOT perfect. Also if any other CMU students have anything to add, please let me know!

Also, feel free to ask questions on any of this or anything about CMU in general, I'd be happy to help!"

Since I plan on going into CS, I was wondering whether UBC CS has a stronger co-op program than UofT CS (Which I heard is PEY at UTSG)? The main factors that I am looking at are employability/""good"" internships opportunities along with solid networking opportunities (and a social life outside of school is always a bonus, but that's asking for a lot). I know that you can find a solid internship at either if you put in the work, but I also know that some programs can definitely make finding internships quite a bit easier and less stressful. Any sort of thoughts/advice is welcome. Thanks!

When I was a sophomore I took a semester off and went abroad last spring, but had to come back because of corona. I am bilingual now(I wasn't before) and during the summer(during covid) worked professionally as a translator for a pretty big company (multi-million revenue). I didn't really have any real life experience with CS so it kind of bored me, I didn't care about my studies because they didn't apply to my life, thus my GPA is \~2.7. This fall and spring I have been making a lot of side projects, and been involved in a lot of Dev communities to get me inspired and feel a lot more real life applications of computer science that I find cool. It has really made me enjoy my schooling more than before.  I feel I have matured a lot as a man and as a student, taking responsibility for my past mistakes in my education. I'm quite a bit behind in school and if I want to graduate on my intended date, spring 2022 I need to take Summer courses, Fall and spring with an average of around 18 credit hours.

&amp;#x200B;

This comes down to my ultimate question

Should I become a 5th year, and go for an internship? Or just graduate on time and go for a full time position afterwards? My side projects are something I've became quite passionate about making, like a fantasy football assistant, chrome extensions, etc. But I don't know if they are good enough to get me a full-time job. I do not want to screw myself and not get an internship, but also racking up more debt by staying in college is not something I want to do either.

mdtepv,324,2021-03-26,"Got in at faang, lost motivation to finish semester (really not flexing lol)",throwiewt,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mdtepv/got_in_at_faang_lost_motivation_to_finish/,"Tldr at bottom. Read tldr if you really think I posted this to flex lol. 

Like the title says, got in at a faang for an internship at beginning of this semester, and it caused me to go spiraling down in a chaotic manner. 

I know - objectively - it's really, really stupid but I've lost complete motivation to do ANY work for my classes this semester ever since I got the offer for an internship.  I was already tired before with covid and just general seasonal depression, but the emotional roller coaster of going through interviews + waiting for an answer + actually getting in (I go to a small university in a rural area, and don't know anyone else who's gotten that far in my department so it was a pretty big deal) has me completely exhausted and just can't get myself to focus on school anymore. 

All I do is think about the upcoming internship, read stuff about it, and maybe once a week I'll have a couple of hours of school productivity.  

Today I hit rock bottom by getting a 15% on a test. Safe to say the average is probably in the 70s. 

It wasn't worth much, but it's for a difficult subject and I'd never scored that low on anything especially when I thought I was at least going to do well. It's not entirely surprising since I didn't study, but I thought I could pull it off, this is basically a wakeup call. 

I just wanted to know if anyone ever went through this, I understand and I'm aware I'm very fortunate, but I didn't expect the weight of it to drain me, and covids impact on online class doesn't mix well either. 

TLDR: Got accepted for swe faang internship a month into semester, was already feeling tired but after all the excitement and all the adrenaline from interviews faded, mixed with online learning, made me pretty much give up on the rest of this semester. Today hit rock bottom by getting 15% on test for important but difficult class."

mdvc5q,24,2021-03-26,UIUC vs UT Austin CS,[deleted],UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/mdvc5q/uiuc_vs_ut_austin_cs/,"I was  admitted to both UT Austin and UIUC for Computer Science. I am in state for UT Austin (29K/year) and will have to pay 55K/year for UIUC. I wanted to ask current students their take on why should I go to UIUC or which option I should chose.

Let me also preface this by saying I absolutely love Illinois. Ive done my research on the CS website. Especially for CS and Grainger, the resources, the networks, the research programs, the internships availability, the advising are absolutely phenomenal and the literal of 100s of engineering student organizations are incredibly difficult to pass up. Not to mention the wealth of CS electives and courses that come with it. I love UT Austin too but UIUC does have an overall better CS program

But its the price tag. If I choose Illinois, I would maybe need to take a loan of 100K whereas my parents will fully cover the cost of UT Austin COA. Its a very difficult decision and spending 220K for an undergraduate degree is a lot of money that Im not sure if its wise to spend rn.

I’m in a bit of a conflicting situation. Right now, I have an offer waiting to be accepted from a company that needs a decision by Monday, let’s say Company A. I did a final interview for a position yesterday that I believe went really well, let’s call this Company B, they said they should have a decision by next week. Now I would much much rather work for Company B. Much better prospects for after graduation of rehire and the work seems it may be much more interesting and fulfilling. 

I really need an internship, so I’m in this issue of “Do I accept this lower paying job at Company A to have a guarantee or take the risk and wait to hear back from Company B who I would love to work at and I believe I have a good chance of getting an offer from?” I would hate myself if I ended up missing an opportunity at Company B because I had already signed on with Company A. But I would also hate myself if Company B didn’t offer me an internship after denying the one from Company A.

Does anyone have any experiences that line up to a similar situation like this? If so, I would love to hear your thought process here. Thank you in advance!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. 11th grade English teacher (teacher rec) - definitely a 10/10, submitted to all schools
2. NHS Sponsor/9th-grade teacher (teacher rec) - she sent me the letter later on and it was really bland and nonspecific :( 6/10, submitted to all schools (unfortunately)
3. Spanish teacher (teacher rec) - absolute 10/10, he didn't get it submitted on time for my schools, unfortunately, but Oberlin needed an extra one and I submitted it there

Every interview I had was absolutely fantastic. Always had an awesome interviewer and we usually went overtime talking.

Wellesley, Oberlin, Princeton, Swarthmore

Requested for WashU but didn't get

**Essays**

My personal essay was decent. Probably 8/10. I wrote about my Mom's cancer journey and how it affected me throughout high school and connected it to the song playing on the radio right before she told me about her diagnosis (Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"").

Some of my supplementals were really great, some weren't as great. I talked a lot about music and performance as well as my passion for education and repairing the American education system. I was going through a lot of emotional trauma due to the sudden death of someone really close to me during RD application time. I just wasn't at my best and was in a state where college applications weren't very important to me.

*Acceptances:*

* Oberlin College!! ($38k scholarship)
* Drake University ($26k scholarship)
* University of Tulsa ($24k scholarship &amp; Leadership TU)

*Waitlists:*

* Wellesley College (my top choice :( )
* Washington University in St. Louis (this was SHOCKING to me, I'm really proud of this honestly)

*Rejections:*

* Swarthmore College (highly expected lol)

Waiting on:

* Wake Forest University (only one I have a sliver of confidence in)
* Barnard College (lol)
* Vanderbilt University (lollllll)
* Brown University (LOL)
* Yale University (LOLLLL)
* Princeton University (LOLLLLLLLLLLL)

**Additional Information:**

Cue the clown music &lt;3 I think I just wasted a lot of time applying to as many T20s as I did... feels bad, honestly, and I wish I had applied to schools that were realistic. I really didn't balance my list well between Reach/Match/Safety because I was unrealistic about what was a match school for me. But hey, it happened, and this is where I am now. If you happen to be an underclassman reading this, please be realistic with yourself! I feel so dumb looking back, haha. I am so in love with Oberlin, though, and I feel like that's where I might end up now. I'm glad I gave it a chance! Planning to repost with all the updates after Ivy Day :)"

But, the recruiter called me to let me know of a DevOps internship to which she could pass on my application information. At this point, I don't know what to do and am mentally exhausted from the numerous amount of rejections. I know that now I may still have another shot at an internship but it feels redundant to possibly interview at the same company and I feel like I wouldn't get the same experience as I would with an SWE internship.

\*\*\*

“Mr. President, if you’ll please come with me,” Agent Brewer made his way into the room and turned on the lights. The LEDs lit his face up with sweat. In his three years of office, President Doug Church had been well aware of the need to wake at a moment’s notice, and he was in his slippers as soon as Brewster opened the door but seeing the panic in Brewer’s eyes gave him an extra boost of adrenaline.

“Ranger is on the move,” Agent Brewer called out, his stubby fingers pressing the communicator into his cauliflower ears. He was stout for the role, but he didn’t get to be the head of the presidential protective detail by being a chump. Doug selected Brewer for his wit; he preferred a man of mitigation and prevention of threats over response and physical prowess. That showed in Doug’s career too, he had lowered his approval rating through demilitarization and downscaling of military expenditure, but he argued that it promoted stability in the world, downsizing the drone program in exchange for investment in education, police, and pro-western news outlets in conflict regions. It had mixed results but reasonable evidence that it would pay off in the future. However, Doug was concerned that whatever was happening may have been a fatal snag in the plan.

They made their way to the presidential emergency operations center, *a glorified bunker*. As they passed through the post-midnight halls, the White House was ablaze, crackling with sparks of assistants, interns, and administrators. Entering and exiting offices, arriving in their silken robes and nightgowns; the smell of coffee and a tinge of evening drinks permeated through the air. Doug’s secret service detail grew in number the closer they got, and they seemed to pick up a new member at every doorway. His wife had been in Minnesota for an early reelection rally that week. He hoped she was safe but didn’t give her much thought beyond that. By the time they had made it to the bunker, there were six agents with President Douglas Church, they fanned out to assess security while Doug made his way to the conference table, waiting there were two of his staff.

“Tabitha, what in the hell is going on?” Doug was looking towards his head secretary Tabitha Linh. She stood less than five feet tall and could find the criminal history of a ladybug. Her role at the White House had been to gather, filter, and deliver intelligence to Doug as soon as she got it. She was the best at what she did, and Doug had to fight with the head of the CIA just to keep her as his eyes and ears.

“Sir,” She tapped her hand on the papers in front of her, “We have an international crisis on our hands.”

“Well don’t be shy,” Doug sat down, and an assistant handed him a coffee; he blew on it before taking timid sips.

“Approximately ten-and-a-half hours ago, satellite imagery reported an anomaly in Southern England; traffic in the area was quickly halted. Nine-hours ago, all UK international air travel was halted and any airborne civilian craft were diverted to France,” She flipped a page and adjusted her glasses, “Eight-and-a-half hours ago, UK domestic air travel was also halted, planes grounded, and interceptors scrambled. Thermal imaging shows large troop movements in the area to surround the anomaly.”

“My god, was there a bombing? What are they defending against?”

“We’re not sure, sir,” Armando Hading across the table interrupted. “Tabitha, if I may take over?” She nodded in approval and was immediately flocked by an intel team. Armando Hading was the Secretary of Defense; he was bald and clean shaven with chiseled facial features that hid his true age. “Sir, to provide some scale, the UK did not scramble nine or ten fighters, they scrambled thirty percent of all active combat service aircraft, and they’ve been running ‘round-the-clock patrols along maritime borders since scrambling.” Hading leaned in closer so that Doug could get a better whiff of the coffee and cream on his breath and to limit the radius of eavesdropping, “Sir, satellite reports that they have opened and are currently prepping nuclear launch silos.”

Doug sat back to take in what he had just heard, before he was able to plan a course of action, “We need any and all intel we can get on the situation this instant. I want drones, spy planes, and ground agents; we need to know everything we can while we have time. What are the Chinese doing?”

“Chinese have dispatched war fleets and interceptors, as have the Russians, French, and Germans. Russian battlecruiser *Admiral Nakhimov* has been conducting freedom of navigation in the area and is reported to have moved four miles off British territorial waters. This seems to have been in response to the Brits as it does not appear to be the UK’s primary focus.”

*Something very strange was happening in the isles, and time was of the essence.* Doug started to tune out the information overflow.

“Mobile missile interceptors have been dispatched and are already screening the Eastern seaboard while others close in on the UK,” one of the generals shouted from across the room.

*Something interior.*

Tabitha shouted to match the volume, “Embassies are on lockdown and can’t leave their offices! Communications are blocked and UK officials aren’t talking either!”

“A coup,” Doug thought out loud and the room stared at him.

“Bless you, sir,” Hading said, “But, I think you may be right.”

“Air Force satellites are reporting transient electromagnetic disturbance yesterday at 2:00pm,” a voice called out.

“EMP?” said Hading, “Did they set off a fucking nuke?! How have we not heard about this?”

“The EMP was localized.” A new face in the room, this one with a moustache instead of the clean shave that had become so common in modern politics. “Dr. Gregory Chen, pleasure to be working with you all, though I wish under better circumstances.” He pulled a chair up at the table. “If I may, I think I have a rough idea of what is going on,” Dr. Chen was the CSO at the White House, he had been hired as a medium to explain the shift to nuclear power in the country; he helped put those that were apprehensive at ease. Even though he played a vital role in the switch, Doug Church had only met him on a couple occasions, but Dr. Chen lived an hour outside of the city; meaning Tabitha probably called him in before they even woke up Doug.

*Curious*.

“Dr. Chen, I think the theories can wait, we need to establish a security network first.” Hading reasserted his position in the room by standing up. “Situation in the UK set aside, we have a Chinese war fleet in the Pacific establishing control over disputed territories, and a Russian carrier group in the North Sea being diverted west.” General Hading shifted his gaze from Dr. Chen to Doug. “Sir, we need to organize an immediate NATO response, JDF is already deploying, and the Korean 2nd and 3rd fleets are set to intercept the Chinese.”

Doug sunk his head into his hands, not body language that inspired confidence in those around him, but it allowed him to block out the distractions. *Chances of a Russian or Chinese backed coup in the UK? Unlikely, their parliament has had record seats for their progressive parties. Chances of a Russian and Chinese naval offensive after said coup? Even more unlikely.* He had to think more rationally, things weren’t always what they seem, but very often they were exactly what they seemed. *Chances that this is a domestic power grab caused by a vacuum? More believable, but what was the vacuum?* He thought about the health of their PM, assuming the Prime Minister is somehow indisposed, and a military junta has assumed control of the state, it is reasonable that Russia and China are also dispatching the very same defensive screens as all other parties. If that was the case, then further escalation on the behalf of the US will only heighten the confusion and tensions as well as shift the focus from the UK to NATO. Doug lifted his head up; *the spotlight is on the crown*.

“Armando,” President Douglas Church sat back up, “Get JDF and ROKN on the horn, they are to return to their posts immediately.”

“But-”

“Parsons!” President Church shouted from his seat, “Get me Prime Minister Yegorova, Tabitha, tell Air Force one to spool up, and call an emergency council in Paris, I will be there in eight hours. I want to meet with Nuclear powers, Germany, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands and the UK if willing.” He stood up from his seat and grabbed his coffee, “Dr. Chen, walk with me.”

“Sir, I’m sorry but I can’t let you leave the operations center,” Agent Brewer blocked President Church’s path, but Church pushed him out of the way.

“If they fire those nukes then what am I the President of? Let’s go, we have very limited time.”

“Great, I look forward to seeing you there,” he hung up the phone and handed it back to his assistant Brett Parsons who joined them along with six secret service agents. “Alright Dr. Chen, you have until we get to the airport to try and explain this by which point, I will finish my night’s sleep.

I feel incredibly burnt out, having worked in patient care through the pandemic. I find the work to be depressingly boring and can't see myself doing this work the rest of my life. I would like to learn CS while I am still reasonably young and capable of learning.

My hope is that I am able to get internships during and find an entry level software developer job through this program. Have there been people who went through this program and were unable to make a career switch? If I am unable to, would you say that the program teaches enough that I would be able to program as a hobby afterwards?

I am debating between working part time as a dentist or being a full time student. What is a reasonable course load if I was working 2-3 days a week? In my field, jobs contractually bind me and I often have to give 60-90 days notice before I can quit. Should I become a full time student instead so I am able to do internships?

Thank you!"

So last year I applied for a internship position at a company in my hometown. I had a great interview and was told I’d be coming in to work with them that summer. Then COVID hit and they refused to let me work as an intern remotely, but the entire office was remote, so they delayed the internship. Eventually, after a ton of emails back and forth, delay after delay, they told me in August they were canceling the internship. 


Fast forward to this February, I get an email from their HR about a position opening up that they thought I’d be interested in. Despite my experience with the internship, I gave them a pass since COVID kinda screwed everything up. Went ahead and sent them my updated resume, went through a zoom interview, did well, then moved on to a lunch interview with the team. The lunch interview went even better, what was supposed to be a 1 hour interview went on for 4 hours. I met everyone in the office, they gave me a tour, and talked to the founder of the company for a good while, even having some light jokes back and forth. We talked about salary and what kind of projects I’d be working on at the end of the interview. I thought I had nailed it. For further confirmation of my original thoughts, I received an email from the CEO that they would be in contact with me that week to start the next steps. I was excited, they seemed like a great / fun team and I figured I could finally stop stressing about landing a job out of school. Then today (three weeks later), I received a rejection email from them saying they don’t believe I would be a great fit for the team. Which took me completely by surprise, and honestly felt like something happened in between the interview and now, but I don’t know what it could’ve been.


All in all, I guess this taught me to never put too much faith in a job until I am officially working for them. But I can’t help but feel bitter about the process I’ve gone through, is this normal?"

me5khw,107,2021-03-26,"How do you make time to learn about the software fields that you like, while being a student and interning?",imstillmb,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/me5khw/how_do_you_make_time_to_learn_about_the_software/,"The more I learn about the software engineering field through school and internships, the more I want to create something by myself and dive deep into the software engineering process on my own. I've spent a bit of time interning at places, and learning concepts and skills at school, all of which were extremely useful to me. But now that I have a foundation, I'm starting to get ideas of what I would like to work towards. I'm starting to get curious about different architectures, frameworks, programming paradigms, and even different fields of the software world. I'm overwhelmed (in a good way) by the number of things that could be learned in this field. The more I know, the more I want to know if that makes sense. The CS/SWE field is a rabbit hole and the potential is endless, but to really get good at it is time consuming.

However, I find that I do not have the time or energy to dive deep into the field and satisfy this curiosity. If I start an online course on a specific framework (separate from my uni courses), I get frustrated when I reach an exciting part late at night but I have work tomorrow. Or, I have a university course assignment that I need to start for next week. This makes me forget about the whole process when I get back to it the next day. I don't like when I'm forced to get outside of a state of flow, I just forget what I was working on or I lose my creativity the next day.

**Basically**: On the one hand, I love and respect the education and skills that I am gaining from my internships and from school. I would not have any foundation nor would I have any curiosity if it were not for courses and internships. On the other hand, a part of me wants to take a year or two to lock in myself inside my room and do nothing but code, tinker, experiment, learn, and see where my own curiosity takes me. After all, that's one of the best ways to get good! It's by focusing intensely on something and really taking the time to understand how it works. But that's not realistic, and I'll probably one day get asked about an ""employment gap"", I'll probably go broke, and I'll forget how to interact with others.

This has been a very real problem for me. I'm seeing if anyone can relate to this. Does anybody else have this dilemma? How do you folks deal with this in the early stages of your tech career without burning out? How do people get good at this field with so little time? I'm trying to stay realistic, I realize that I cannot simply quit everything and become a freelancer who is self-taught and makes 6 figures right away. I just need suggestions."

Hi there, I’m currently choosing between these 2 engineering schools. I have visited UCI and really liked the campus and have heard that it’s similar at least prestige wise to UCSD. But I’ve also heard bad things about STEM professors at UCI and that it’s a little better at UCSD. I was admitted to Marshall at UCSD and will likely visits the campus in a few weeks.

I've been extremely fortunate to receive offers from a FAANG company and Palantir. I have decided to take the FAANG offer as my summer internship, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to take a quarter off next year for the Palantir internship (as I've heard they do allow interns to defer).

Taking the quarter off for Palantir would be a great experience, but a heavier work load in my senior year as well as a quarter away from my college friends &amp; experience.

Not taking the quarter off would mean a super relaxing senior year with my friends, but completely missing out on that offer.

One thing to note: in the case that I received full-time return offers from both companies, I would take the FAANG one. With these factors in mind, what would you guys do in my situation?

Things never work in my favor and I'm never going to make money even with the game that I release at some point.

I'm unemployed, I don't have a soulmate/girlfriend, parents constantly yell or get pressured about my future and I'm constantly being paranoid. I can never get any peace of mind.

I want to die. I want this to end, I can't take it anymore. Even if gaming makes me happy, it's only a temporary thing and it just fades away. I've been applying everywhere but no one calls or replies back except my former boss who just keeps saying that nothing is in for me at the moment.

I want to be dead. If I got cancer or if I can drink poison, I'd happily do it. Anything to end this terrible life of mine and anything for me to never exist ever again.

Therapy doesn't work. Can't do volunteer work till this pandemic is officially over and by the time the pandemic is over, my future of restoring my career is long gone. Even if I get this planned internship that I had applied for, it's only temporary and not permanent. 

I shouldn't have forced myself to go into my mom's words and left the first company I worked on, only for things not ending so well for the second company, and have been jobless for about a year now.

I want to die. I hate this \*\*\*\*\* life that I'm stuck with. I wish I'm strong enough to strangle myself with a belt so I can die. I wish I can muster the courage to stab my chest or slice my wrists to die. Heck, I just wish I get hit by a truck or a car to get internal bleeding for all I care.

If anyone could share any insiders' information about any of these three programs, really appreciate it.

A few concerns about each program.

CMU-SV SE: 

1. How is the course quality? More than half of the students from this program complain about the bad course quality. Grading largely bases on Professor's subjective opinions. The quality is not comparable to courses in Pittsburgh. 

2.If I would like to relocate to New York after graduation, is it hard? Does goldman, 2 sigma, and citi these financial companies like CMU students over Columbia students (tech jobs such as SDE)? Is getting into FAANG in New York harder than in Silicon Valley?

&amp;#x200B;

Columbia MSCS: How is the employment statistics? I found this url on Columbia's website: [https://www.cs.columbia.edu/career/student-resources/](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/career/student-resources/)

However, I am skeptical about the median salary. One my undergrad alumni told me that it is not hard to find a job as a Columbia student, but it is hard to get a decent job, which he means Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn. Thus, how is the real situation for Columbia students looking for interns and full time? Is it hard to get into these big tech? Is it really easy to get into tech companies in NYC?"

megm74,1,2021-03-27,Deciding Between Schools,steventylerperry,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/megm74/deciding_between_schools/,"I recently have gotten accepted into several different programs that I applied to for graduate school and am now having trouble deciding which to pick.

 Option A is the most prestigious school out of the ones I was accepted  into, with great academics and internship opportunities, but it is in DC, which isn't the most ideal city for my ideal social scene. I feel as if this program will be the most important for my career trajectory, but I am a very social person and feel as if the stress of school mixed with a higher cost of living and general vibe of the people who are more focused on their careers might be a turn off for me. The other draw back is the price of the school is pretty expensive and I did not get any financial aid. 

Option B is still a great school but a newer program (I would be in the 2nd cohort), its slightly less expensive and I did receive some scholarship from the school that would help out with cost. This school is in Chicago, somewhere I have visited and really see myself being happy, but I am not sure the degree would put me on a path professionally that would compare with the other school's degree. The academics from Option A align closer to what I want to do professionally, but I feel like I can still achieve similar positions (not as prestigious) with Option B.  

So basically I feel as if I am choosing between my social/mental health well being and my ideal career trajectory. Has anyone gone through a similar thinking process? I have heard how stressful graduate school can be, and having a social life can play a big role in helping with the stress outside of school. But on the other hand I'm worried if I chose Option B I am going to regret my decision later on in life. If anyone has any thoughts or insights that would be a huge help!"

There are prestigious school accepting my application. I am really happy about that. 

I am admitted to the schools with relatively lower rankings but the major attracts me. I am still discussing which to attend with my parents. I have consulted many people, such as my teachers. They said the major I like is the most important. I know that as well. There is a major I like but the school is not so famous for its academic rankings. And the school is known for its business school, but the major I like is in college of engineering. Even few information about the major I like can be found on the Internet. 

In contrast, I am also accepted by a university with higher rankings and people on the Internet say graduates have high opportunities to get a job after graduation within 2years. Students are provided with many internship opportunities, which is undeniably great for me, for my future carrier. However, the major teach students both Business&amp;Information Technology course. Students will more focus on business, like 60%/40%, Business/Information Technology, respectively. I want to learn a wide range of knowledge about computing because I desire a comprehensive understandings of networking, database, programming, etc. Business is good since I plan to run my own business in the future, but I need to gain experiences from my jobs first, and then open a business with the experiences and knowledge learned.

 The major mentioned in the second paragraph can satisfy my needs ,but, as I said, the rankings, information and remarks are limited.  I am confused about my decision. Dose school’s rankings really matter? Do Interviewers prefer people who have a nice college on its ranking and name to those who do not?  

Thank you guys for helping me!!!!"

I am a Computer Science major and I live about 40 mins away from UIC (meaning I would commute seen as my parents find it useless to move out) and 1 hour away from NIU (meaning I would dorm). The thing is, I have a full ride to NIU as well as I am in their honors college. Everything is paid for and I also receive my Pell Grant money directly seen as there are no other payments. On the other hand for UIC, I am in the honors college as well as the GPPA Program which will guarantee me a *seat* for a PhD. UIC will be near free and super affordable. I applied to UIUC and got waitlisted, but the waitlist decision will be made by late June, far past the May 1st deadline for UIC and NIU. Although both my options sound appealing, I truly want what's best for my future. I do not really care to move out that much but I do want good internship opportunities, etc. I have already done extensive research for weeks on both schools but I just can not seem to settle on one or the other as I find myself constantly switching between them. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions if you need any information."

I had a discussion with a fantastic lady at her 30s, she is learning at home through online courses the field of network administration (cisco). She is dreaming of a place that would hire her remotely and allow her to become an intern / assistant to the engineers onboard. So she could study, practice and gain experience through assisting and mentorship of the engineers at hand.

She is very dedicated and highly focused individual, beforehand, she used to do copywriting, customer service roles and SMM. Now she knows what she wants to do in her life and I wanted to share her story, maybe we could surprise her and offer her an incredible opportunity where she could grow and contribute.

She told me literally, she doesn't care about payroll but actual practice and mentorship at this point and give her best to the organization that would take up on this with her.

Now days she lives in Sakartvelo (Europe), as she doesn't speak the local language there (Georgian), she has  ery low chances if at all find such a place, hence remote is the ideal solution for her.

Her name: Anutka 
Languages: English and Russian 
Her Telegram: @ninecoffee

Let's get this incredible talent a place to build her future with.

Thank you."

The situation is that I'm applying for an internship and have been asked to submit a simple application, e.g. a small text editor (it's not that, but similar), with source of course, in an archive.

I'm working it up in QT Creator right now, but how do I ensure they can build it without needing to have QT as well? Can I link this as a static library? Do I need a fancy makefile? Apologies for being so clueless, but I haven't had this come up before and am not sure what to do.

Additional details: C++ is a requirement (else I'd use a more graphics-friendly language, obviously). I'm working on macOS but whatever I send should be cross-platform. I'm open to trying something else like wxWidgets if QT isn't the best idea for this. Oh, and I'm on an eval copy of QT.

Grateful for any help. Thank you.

EDIT: So, looks like QT is out! If anyone has a rec for something else that'd be great to have. Thanks again."
mejqp7,7,2021-03-27,FAANG internship or small company full time career?,purple_sanpa,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/mejqp7/faang_internship_or_small_company_full_time_career/,"I'm a final year CS student who's looking for jobs to start after I graduate, I have two job offers at the moment and I'm not sure which one to take, one is an internship at FAANG that involves doing stuff that I honestly can't see myself enjoying, in a company culture that I think I'll be unhappy in, it lasts around 3 months with opportunities to move onto a graduate scheme and then become a full time employee if you do well.

The other is a full time job offer at a small company, the pay is mediocre at best (about 5k GBP less than the internship) it doesn't seem to improve much with experience, and I'm definitely not interested in staying there for more than a few years, but the culture and job description sounds perfect for me, the company's ""mission"" is close to my heart as well.

I feel like taking the FAANG internship would be the best option because:

* Even if I leave pretty soon, it'll still look great on my CV
* It'll likely learn quicker than on the other job
* I've already decided that I'd like to move on from the small company as I can get a better job in a similar field/another field that I enjoy
* I might decide that I enjoy working at the company
* If I stay with the FAANG company, then my salary will likely be much higher a few years down the line that what it would be if I leave after the internship/never take it in the first place

Yet despite this, I just feel a sense of dread whenever I go to write my acceptance letter, I feel like I'm dooming myself to a miserable 3+ months, on top of that, I'm not sure how easily I'll be able to find a decent job after finishing my internship, I feel like I'm not thinking rationally about this but I really don't want to work at this company. My friends are all suggesting that I go for the full time career since I'll probably enjoy it more, while my family are treating me like I'm mental for having not accepted the internship

What do you guys think I should do? Is my reasoning on point? Am I not considering anything?"

* Could be co-head of FBLA next year or maybe some other potential club leadership
* I could either write Varsity Baseball (which I only did freshman year), Independent CS Study, or just leave this final EC spot blank on my common app. Thoughts?

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

Essays and LORs should be pretty good, I participate in class and have pretty good relationships with teachers. Starting to think about essays and will get some guidance from people I know.

Question: I have two weeks left in my 6 month IT Help Desk/ IT Desktop Support Internship and recently as of yesterday I have come to the conclusion that I would like to part ways with the company after completing the Internship and take a vacation traveling for about two months after Graduation before looking for my first real job in the field. Should I bring it up as early as Monday to my supervisor that i am not interested in becoming a full time employee or extending the internship or is this something i should say on my last day of the internship? Im not really sure how to handle this professionally or how the end of an internship usually works.

After carefully going through the last 6 months it feels like i have learned all i can at this internship and I want to continue moving up in my career. My next move is hopefully becoming a Jr.Systems Administrator/Sys Admin after receving my degree in Computer Information Systems.

mer0ne,2,2021-03-27,Is it too late for me to able to land a post-grad job in the field I'm interested in?,anxiouscsstudent999,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mer0ne/is_it_too_late_for_me_to_able_to_land_a_postgrad/,"For starters, I am a CS student that will be going into their 4th year (final semester) of my degree. Compared to my peers. I'm not as ambitious as them. I've barely done any side projects outside of my regular academic curriculum. My current internship is something I only took because all the other ones I interviewed for (10+ interviews by the way) had rejected me. Back then, I had no idea what I wanted to do. My internship is almost ending (it's a year long) and I've realized I'm not even personally interested in the work I'm doing in it (it's in cloud IT/engineering).

While I'm still not entirely sure of what I want to do, the area that interests me the most is front-end development. Creating websites, and focusing on results that can be visually testable. In the future, I may even move to full stack to challenge myself. However, again, I barely have any experience in what I'm doing and I'm not having much success in finding an internship in that field.

While some of my other peers were building projects and learning new skills during  lockdown period, all I did was work 40 hours a week and play video games after work. The only thing remotely front end related I did over the lockdown was redesign a website using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. From that I learned a bit, but it's not enough. I'm still not familiar with JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, etc. etc. and all those other important front-end development frameworks I should know!

However, I find it unlikely that I'll find a front-end/full stack internship before I finish my schooling. I just had a front-end intern interview which I got rejected about a day ago, which further worsened my already terrible mental state. I'm finally starting to take things seriously (learning react), but I fear it may be too late. I have 9 months until I graduate (4 months which I'll be extremely busy). Is it possible for me to find a good new grad job in front end development/software engineering if I don't get an internship this summer?

I just feel so incompetent, I fear even with side projects I won't be good enough. I know it's never too late to stop learning but there's just too much I don't know."
mer8w3,0,2021-03-27,Just found out I'll be on an AWS team during Amazon internship - is it true that AWS is the worst team?,EntertainerAdept,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mer8w3/just_found_out_ill_be_on_an_aws_team_during/,"Basically I heard that only the senior engineers on AWS get to do anything interesting, and the work is boring at best for everyone else. I've also heard of a few interns who didn't even get to do any coding during their internship, and just had to go and tweak various settings and collect metrics.

I'm worried that this will basically be a death sentence for my career. I'll waste the entire summer on an internship where I won't learn or do anything, and be screwed when recruiting in the fall since I didn't do anything that summer."

mesf7d,0,2021-03-27,Internships,yo_itbambi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mesf7d/internships/,What type of tasks would I be assigned to do as an intern for software engineering? Would they be projects based on the frameworks I know or something different but would have to learn the frameworks to do the job?
mesiza,1,2021-03-27,Trying to break into IT business analyst roles,CountyExcellent8447,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/mesiza/trying_to_break_into_it_business_analyst_roles/,"I am about to graduate as an Information Systems major. I am exploring IT business analyst options. I learned a mixture of skills like: relational database design, some business/data analysis methodologies/techniques, SQL, Python, CS fundamentals , and some web development. However I feel like it was surface level, I am not truly an expert in anything. 

I had a planned BA internship for summer 2020 but it was cancelled due to COVID. I will be graduating without any experience and really I am not really sure where to go from here. I have been applying for a little while now with no success.

I’ve heard from other people that getting into IT business analyst pipelines without internships is really difficult. Should I try to get my foot in the door with a parallel position such as data analysis or other entry level roles? I am also not really sure what skills/ additional skills I should be polishing up/adding to a resume and the best way to navigate the overall pursuit process. And finally do you have any advice for networking other than just cold applying? that’s what I’ve mainly been doing for now."

Yep, here's another underrated LAC of the Southeast! Some (or maybe none) of you who lurk on the circlejerk subreddit may have seen my shitpost about [Wofford and dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/A2C_circlejerk/comments/jmgvux/ah_yes_the_best_college_for_engaging_in_a/). However, I want to make it clear that no, it doesn't have a focus on studying canines. Rather, it is your typical solid LAC with special perks highlighted here, its location being Spartanburg, South Carolina:

* Wofford College has an undergraduate population of 1,775 students and a 12:1 student/faculty ratio, and it has no graduate students. 94% of students receive some form of financial aid, the same percentage also applying to students living on campus. It also had a solid 81% graduation rate recently. 90% of faculty hold a P.h.D. or terminal degree, and the average class size is 18.
* Wofford's been on the rise for the last couple of years. For instance, although rankings should be taken with a grain of salt, its position on the USNews liberal arts college rankings has shifted from No. 82 in the 2016 edition to No. 69 (tie) in the current 2021 edition. It's also seen record [enrollments](https://www.wofford.edu/about/news/news-archives/2020/wofford-moves-up) and [applications](https://www.wofford.edu/about/news/news-archives/2021/applications-up) as well (seeing a record low 53% acceptance rate plus record enrollments as of last year despite enrollment panics at many colleges due to the pandemic and still increasing by a [modest 5% in applications this school year plus a 6% increase in non-white applicants and an increasing GPA](https://www.wofford.edu/about/news/updates/update-from-president-samhat)), indicating that its reputation has indeed shifted in its favor!
* The liberal arts college is best known for being one of the few with D1 athletic sports, boasting a total of 19 NCAA Division 1 athletic teams including a men's basketball team, a women's basketball team, and a football team! Nearly 25% of students are dedicated athletes for such sports! Its most notable alumnus is arguably Jerome Johnson Richardson Sr., who was admitted on a partial football scholarship and graduated from the college to play for the Baltimore Colts from 1959-1960 and later the founder and 1st owner of the Carolina Panthers franchise. He has so far contributed $262.2 million to the college in his lifetime, including $150 million on February 24, 2021, to add to the college's campaign that has raised more than $301 million since 2014 and before the donation! With the exception of last year, the Carolina Panthers held training camp at Wofford's campus since 1995 and hope to come back next year!
* While it, unfortunately, doesn't yet meet the full demonstrated need of all students, students selected for its [Bonner Scholars chapter](https://www.wofford.edu/academics/center-for-community-based-learning/bonner-scholars-program) will gain such a benefit.
* It offers [27 majors, 27 minors, and 16 concentrations total](https://www.wofford.edu/academics/majors-and-programs), with the most popular ones for the college class of 2019 being Biology, Finance, English, Psychology, Spanish, Accounting, Government, and Business Economics. As expected with most liberal arts colleges at this point, it also hosts a 3-2 or 4-1 dual-degree engineering program, partnering with Clemson University and Columbia University in the City of New York. It also participates in ROTC and a Pre-Ministry program to serve niche interests as well.
* Wofford does have an honor code as well, which is run by a student council to encourage academic and social responsibility and trust.
* Wofford's [general education requirements](http://catalog.wofford.edu/degree-program-requirements/general-education-requirements/) are a bit more extended than many colleges, but a lot of the curriculum can be filled by some of its many classes since most aren't restricted to just one single required course (the only ones being humanities and wellness). So for the ones who love a more complex core curriculum, you have to fulfill courses for Foreign Language, English, Fine Arts, Cultures &amp; Peoples (courses of either non-European cultures or interactions between western cultures and other cultures), Social Science, History, Religion, Philosophy, Mathematics, and Natural Science.
* For those interested in opportunities related to entrepreneurship, it does offer [some programs that could test your skills or mentorship from requests](https://www.wofford.edu/academics/entrepreneurship-innovation/programs). There's also the [James Atkins Student-Managed Investment Fund](https://www.wofford.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/accounting-business-and-finance/james-atkins-fund), an organization which, in summary, gives student members the opportunity to manage a stock portfolio and hold monthly research and presentations for one of four research groups: Domestic Equity and International, Domestic Equity and Alternative, Domestic Equity and Real Estate, and Domestic Equity.
* Wofford is also part of the [iCAN (College Access Network) program](https://www.wofford.edu/about/news/updates/update-from-president-samhat), which trains Wofford students and matches them up as mentors one-on-one with Spartanburg County high school students who are part of the [Citizen Scholars program](https://uwpiedmont.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=5174), a seven-year program for the academically excelling students that has caused a 70%+ enrollment in colleges around the nation.
* An official committee of the college dedicated to equality and diversity held [a series of listening sessions that gained perspectives from students, alumni, staff, faculty, and trustees over the months](https://www.wofford.edu/about/jedi/strategic-vision/listening-sessions), and the committee has set up [a series of recommendations in March of 2021](https://www.wofford.edu/Wofford.edu/Documents/About/jedi/presentation-210311.pdf) as to how they'll improve inclusivity and diversity!
* The liberal arts college has posted [an outcomes section](https://www.wofford.edu/admission/outcomes) for those of you who are curious. The 2019 First Destination survey reported a 99.5% career outcomes rate (62.4% working, 29.7% continuing education, 1.4% military, and 0.8% volunteering, etc) while the 2020 version reported a 96.3% outcomes rate (52.5% working, 33.6% continuing education, 2.5% military, 1.8% volunteering, 0.3% internships, etc).

I hope that I've been able to tell you why I feel that Wofford's yet another liberal arts college by both A2C standards and the general public's standards! Yeah, the highlights series has been on a relatively long hiatus, so I apologize if this highlight post wasn't as detailed! Good luck to the high school seniors of the 2020-2021 school year on their decisions as well as future college applicants!

Have a nice day!"

5. School Honors award(s)

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

I sent three recommendations everywhere that allowed it, and two to the places that only allowed two. The two I sent everywhere were from my favorite English teacher (who went to BU and taught at Northeastern, which she never mentioned in the letter but I’m sure may have been noticed), and my College Physics teacher. Even though I applied STEM, I excelled in English throughout high school and write a lot of short stories and poetry, so that’s why I chose my English teacher. College Physics, on the other hand, was my worst grade on my entire transcript, so I figured that sending a rec from that teacher irregardless of the low grade would demonstrate that I paid attention and formed good relationships in that class, even if it didn’t come naturally to me. 

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

I actually only interviewed at one school, and it was the one I was rejected from. That school (Northwestern) had a ~4% acceptance rate RD this year, so I don’t think the interview affected my rejection much; it actually went very well. It was over Zoom, and the man who interviewed me was very kind. It lasted about an hour. my advice for interviews is to go in knowing questions you want to ask about the school. the interviewer will probably be impressed and surprised when, at the end of the interview, they ask if you have any questions and you actually DO. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I won’t lie to you all - my essay was incredibly good. I’m a good and frequent writer, and I actually got paid to edit college essays all throughout high school so I had lots and lots of practice with weeding out bad concepts and writing for essays. My essay want really ABOUT anything per se, it was kind of an abstract view of the ways I changed throughout high school, as a person. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Northeastern University (RD)
* Boston University (RD)
* Worcester Polytechnic Institute (EA II)

**Additional Information:**
I still haven’t heard back from Cornell, but I’ll update when I do. Applied to colleges of engineering at every school except NYU, where I applied to the school of sciences, whichever one that is. I received essentially comparable aid everywhere."
mesoon,7,2021-03-27,Narcissistic Hoarding Abusive Indian Parents,_inspire,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/mesoon/narcissistic_hoarding_abusive_indian_parents/,"So I (20F) moved out of my parent's house over the Summer of 2020, University was the perfect excuse for me to leave because it's a common cultural thing to have to live with your parents up until you get married because the expectation is that you settle down and get married, especially when you're a female. I have obviously been wanting to move out for as long as I could remember years before I even was in Uni. Fast forward to now, I'm enjoying my Uni, my work-study, and now even my Internship. I try to financially support myself as best as I can because my parents use it as emotional blackmail on me when they financially support me or pay for any expenses for me, but mind you the expectation they have for me is that once I graduate and find a good full-time job as a Software Engineer, I will be financially paying them back and helping ease them into retirement. There is always constant pressure on me because I am their oldest daughter and also a first-generation college student. I internally feel like I have this obligation to them to pay back for their ""sacrifices"" for coming to America and providing a life here for me and my siblings.

Now my issue with the present-day is that I resent coming back home. I absolutely HATE coming back, but I came back this weekend for my Dad's and Bro's bday. Don't get me wrong, my parents financially have always done everything for me and my family, but they don't seem to understand how their constant daily arguments and comments take a toll on the rest of the family. My dad always makes comments about how I don't care about the family or about him when I talk back when I respectfully do so because I am tired of him verbally abusing me and my mom especially and thinking it's okay. I talk back to stand up to myself, not to purposely start an argument. Don't get me wrong when I am back at my apartment, and they call me I genuinely do like talking to them (both of my parents) over the phone because there are no arguments or issues, we just talk like normal people. My mom is even worse sometimes, she doesn't realize that her comments about how ""She's young, she'll learn respect"" or even saying how ""No one will marry you"". Like what?? I'm sorry that I am more focused on my life atm building up a career for myself. I honestly don't even like Indian guys in general because my parents have ruined the thought of relationships and marriage for me. That and the expectation that I am a housewife/mom for a grown-ass man, like what???

As if things couldn't get any worse, they're both complete slobs. Hoarders to be exact. You know how you see those tik toks with people showing their bad mental health days with messy rooms and all that? Yeah well, it's been like that for the past 15 years for as long as I can remember. It's so bad, that I don't even like eating in the kitchen because of all the flies, nor do I like using the bathroom because it's unimaginably disgusting and filthy like a bad public restroom. I've tried everything from cleaning the mess for them to making a time slot and schedule telling them who cleans what, but literally, no one gives a damn. I got so tired of constantly cleaning up after them that I decided enough is enough and would just clean whatever I used/needed and nothing else. It doesn't help that both of my parents are in their mid-50s and work literally all night, so they sleep for the majority of the day while my brothers are well messy boys that also don't clean up after themselves nor others.

Now you're probably wondering why I don't just cut off all my communication with them and just well live the rest of my life. I have my own place, I'm in a different city, so it's easy, right? WRONG.  
It's not that easy. Like I said I recognize that how they have treated me and how they still continue to treat me is not OK and it is taking a toll on my mental health. I constantly start crying for absolutely no particular reason in the middle of the day or sometimes even wake up with tears in my eyes. I HATE that I feel like this. I hate that they've conditioned me to feel that crying is not even okay because they consider it as a sign of weakness nor do they take me seriously when it happens. I hate that things like someone raising their hand in my direction cause me to involuntarily flinch because of the years of physical and mental abuse I was subjected to as a child. I know I need to see a therapist. And I plan on doing it soon since I can financially handle the expenses now. I'm just wondering if anyone has or is in the current situation that I'm in right now and how you're handling it?

Please don't tell me to cut off all communication with my parents, I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. I can limit my communication and I can sure as hell not visit them as much, but I cannot fully block them out of my life because I do care about them still and I do love them as fucked up as that sounds.

My family is moving to a new state, and I've had to withdraw several times from the courses in my college because I have a lot of trouble learning from lectures. I have ADHD, and Aspergers which means I lose concentration very easily, and it takes me a bit longer than most people to ""translate"" words into meanings. If the topic is fairly complex I often find it very difficult to learn from lectures. 

I've passed all but 4 of the courses I need by seeking various resources outside of class, but I've reached a point where the material is often hard to find resources for because it's not commonly used.

I have a slight math disability, and I've also been focusing so much on trying to pass my math requirements that I never bothered to look at what is actually required to get a job. I was told that if I have a C average, I'd get a job."" I have no internships, honors, or projects. I have hardly worked on leetcode. 

I enjoy programming, and I wish I did more of it in more coursework. Instead we mostly focus on solving mathematical or other abstract logical problems. I feel unprepared to have a job because I know so little of what goes into software development. My college focuses very heavily on general education, and I've only taken about five courses that mostly consisted of learning programming, data structures, and the software development process.

Furthermore, I am an extreme introvert. I have no references because I never tried to make any friends. I prefer to be by myself.

You can see I've made a bunch of mistakes. I should've gone for an applied CS degree, tried to avoid a college with heavy math requirements, made friends, gotten an internship, etc. I just assumed that this would be alright, without really doing any research.

Now, I have three choices, I can continue at the college I'm at while my parents move to a new state, I could follow my parents and transfer to a college in my new state, or just study on my own.

I would really like to study on my own. It costs nothing, I won't have to deal with lectures, and I can focus on the skills that will get me a job. I might be able to get a part time job and get some references that way. I won't be able to get an internship, or references that can talk about my programming skills, but I'll be able to create some projects. Once the job market recovers I'll probably be in a good position to seek employment.

I know that going to, and presumably finishing, college is the default advice here. I'm just not sure it's for me at this point.

Is dropping out to study on my own until the job market recovers a good plan, or are there still compelling reasons for me to either try and finish my degree, or transfer to a new university?"
meuds7,44,2021-03-28,"Tried so hard to succeed, did succeed, and still a failure.",LegitimateScholar8,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/meuds7/tried_so_hard_to_succeed_did_succeed_and_still_a/,"I am at a point where I am regretting most of the decisions of my life. Sorry for the rant/word vomit.

&amp;#x200B;

I studied so hard in school, hoping that it would lead to a good job and a good relationship. It led to not having time to develop social skills and always being the socially awkward nerd. I did end up getting a full scholarship to college for a math degree.

I studied so hard in college to keep straight A's and graduated with a 3.9 GPA, with 2 majors and 1 minor, hoping this would lead to a good career and a good relationship and a good life. But I had pushed myself too much and I fell into depression, social skills worsened, and I messed up my only couple opportunities to date in college - which made me feel suicidal.

I tried to balance out being a ""nerd"" by being really good at a sport. So i spent most of my free time training for this sport, and was able to compete in a national competition one year during college. I thought maybe I could meet someone to date doing this sport, but I took it too seriously and/or intimidated everyone I could have dated. In hindsight, maybe none of this was worth it.

After college, I had zero ability to get a job. I finally got a job as a min-wage intern roughly 9 months after graduating, where I was not treated well at all. It was a finance company and I was, on a few occasions, ridiculed for mentioning my favorite investment: cryptocurrency.

I got offered a full time job as a programmer shortly thereafter, having never studied programming, and was not good at it. This job made me more depressed, unbearably lonely, and stressed. I thought maybe finally someone might want to date me if I was holding down some normal job. But the job killed any bits of emotion I had left. Depression worsened and I decided to quit to ""travel the world"" for a year. I think a lot of friends thought I had given up at life, and they mostly right.

Enter 2017 and the major cryptocurrency bull run. I manage to turn my $20k of crypto into $1m of crypto. Perhaps the most stressful and fulfilling part of my life - felt like saying ""screw you"" to most of society and actually... winning? Never looked for any other job since then as I made a million at 25 (and cashed it out).

Now that I had all this free time, i thought it would be simple to find a SO who wanted to travel the world with me, settle down in a relatively frugal but work free and stress free life, etc. Maybe we could both be digital nomads? At least I would have fun travelling.

But no, life is never that easy. Family and friends distanced themselves from me. Some thought I was lazy and refusing to grow up and find a normal job. Some were a bit envious if they knew I had made some $ on crypto. My social/emotional skills, being undeveloped, kept me from any long term relationships. Potential dates working part time at min wage jobs refused second dates because they perceived me as ambitionless. I swiped right on dating apps all the time, got one match occasionally, and always got ghosted shortly after.

Feel lazy, feel unmotivated, feel like a failure. Then i would trade crypto and make $10k or $20k in a trade, and feel better about myself. Decided to do more travelling, see different parts of the world on my own. Then of course, covid hits. All of those plans gone. Everyone just bickering about politics constantly. So isolated, social skills get worse, started drinking more and watching porn more - ended up doing too much of both, often at the same time. At one point I ended up paying a woman online to humiliate and degrade me while demanding me to drink more and more alcohol. Ended up puking all over my bed and floor. Felt worthless, unlovable and like trash. Tried to pay a stripper to humiliate me... she hugged me and said she couldn't find anything to humiliate me about. If i had the emotional capacity to cry, I would have done so then.

2021 comes and crypto spikes again. Up another $500k, but have felt emotionless and numb the entire time. Mental health deteriorates and to try and feel better, decide to move back in with some roommates. Have so little motivation that I am sleeping on my friends mattress they were trying to throw away instead of my perfect $5k mattress I absolutely love. Just haven't had the motivation to move it. Self confidence at zero.

For some reason I started to get some heart palpitations/arrhythmias. A sister has a heart problem and this elevates my risk of one... and I know I should see a doctor about this. Maybe i drank too much alcohol? I was probably borderline heavy drinker for 3 months (average 2+ drinks per day), but dialed that way back a month before they started. Honestly, I think loneliness, rejection, and feelings of worthlessness have broken my heart. or maybe some lingering symptom from asymptomatic covid?

But my motivation is zero. Also need to set up dental appointments, skipped the last year. Haven't seen a normal doctor in probably 7-8 years - i know how important it is but during all this time I have felt more-or-less indifferent to death so didn't think much of it. Always thought I would get better if I found a SO to build a life with, but as of now, that seems more and more unlikely.

Now I just turned 29 years old. I have something like $1.4 million of investments and can live a long time without worrying about anything. But i cannot relate to anyone. I want to travel, do sports, live more or less frugally and carefree - so many people think I am wasting my life not working/being unemployed/being lazy/not having a direction. Asking me what I want out of life. Everyone is just busy working. I have never had a job that i wanted to have, never had sex with anyone (I have paid multiple prostitutes to cuddle with me), and have not felt like I have had any friends or family to really ""open up with"" and discuss my issues with in probably 15 years. I do, but haven't been able to initiate these conversations out of fear of rejection. I never knew how bad loneliness could be and I feel like I am drifting away from everyone.

So yes, in recap: Tried so hard to succeed, did succeed, and still a failure. Regretting most of the decisions of my life."
meuiph,41,2021-03-28,How to have a satisfying high school experience AND get into top colleges,SolidNectarine8631,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/meuiph/how_to_have_a_satisfying_high_school_experience/,"Hey everyone! So, as a high school senior with just a couple of months left, I've been thinking a lot about the things I could've done in high school to have a more fulfilling time. If you're early in your high school or middle school career, some of these tips may help you have a good experience. Honestly, even if you're as far along as college, most of these tips are universal and can help you wherever you go. So, with that being said, let's get into it!

**\*DISCLAIMER\*** These may not written with strong judgment. I'm writing this to the best of my ability, but oversights are inevitable, so please take these with a grain of salt. I'm just a kid after all.

# Balancing College Prep and Life

A lot of people will set their minds on elite colleges and do everything in their power to appease to these colleges, not realizing that by basing their lives around building up a strong profile, they are straying farther from what colleges **actually** want: someone who is driven to pursue what THEY love. A lot of people will join a bunch of clubs and teams solely for college admissions, and while they may do well and think they're in the clear to show passion, admissions officers aren't stupid. They can (mostly) see the difference between an activity done for college and one done for personal gain.

&amp;#x200B;

# Finding the Motivation

If you're anything like me, you've tried working with tons of these lists, and none of them lead to anything. Here's the thing: no amount of self-help books and life skill lists will cure a lack of motivation. The mental health crisis among our generation and on this sub especially is alarming and heartbreaking. I'm sure a lot of you are suffering with severe burnout, depression, anxiety, abusive households, crazy responsibilities, financial struggles, and a million other adversity cocktails that are hindering your ability to bE pRoDuCtIvE. Someone who has to hold a full-time job to take care of a family isn't going to appear as successful as a kid who has their entire life taken care of with clubs, internships, competitions, and whatever in suburbia. This is why colleges evaluate you against your opportunity. It's about character and making the best of what you have.

If you can't follow these tips after trying, you haven't failed. The opposite, actually: by trying, you are succeeding. Be proud of yourself for that. Every little thing that you accomplish, be proud of yourself for it. A minimal amount of effort over a long period of time is better than a huge amount of effort on an impulse. You're killing it and I'm proud of you. Take everything one step at a time, and always keep your goals in view (one of the tips actually). Before you know it, you'll be in a place you thought was impossible to achieve.

With that being said, let's get into the tips.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Tips

**MY SECRET TO LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHING: The 'F it' mentality**

If you are ever shrinking back from something, just push yourself against your mental state with every fiber of your body until you do it (as long as it is not detrimental to your health or will hurt you in the long run). Any temporary embarrassment, pain, or loss from the action will eventually fade, but you may gain something that you would have never seen had you not pushed yourself. You can apply this to literally anything: trying out for a sport, asking your crush out, joining a new club, whatever. It's SUCH a useful skill to have and will push you far in life and your high school journey.

Now I'm not gonna lie, this one is quite hard to master. It's so easy for us to fall back into our comfort zones and avoid taking risks. Like with any habit, baby steps is the way to go. Try and gradually build up to the point where pushing yourself into uncomfortable situations is a regular occurrence, at which point your possibilities are limitless. You will surprise yourself with all the things you can accomplish.

One way I motivate myself to follow this mentality is imagining the end result of pushing myself. Finishing a long project, Doing well in a competition, making a new friend, etc. That way, I have some incentive and it makes ripping the comfort zone-brand band-aid off a little easier.

This is a great tip to battle procrastination, by the way. When I know I can't keep watching YouTube and delaying my life obligations, I painfully close every tab and jump right into writing an essay or finishing homework, no matter how uncomfortable. It has saved me MANY times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Academics: Challenge yourself according to your own ability**

If you want to get into a top college, challenging yourself in academia is definitely a plus. But you don't need to take all 17 AP courses your school offers or finish Calculus in 10th grade as a product of countless mental breakdowns. And you DEFINITELY don't want to let it hinder your life outside of school.

So please, challenge yourself and take courses that are outside of your comfort zone, but don't push it to the point where you absolutely hate everything and want to quit school altogether. A rule of thumb: if academics are significantly restricting what you can do in your life, you should probably scale back your course load.

This is different for every person. The typical STEM-oriented MIT aspirant will want to take all those APs and extra college courses, while someone who doesn't have the time to devote their life to academics due to work or other circumstances will want a lighter course load. Both may find it challenging to deal with all the work at times, and that's totally normal. But if it's significantly hindering their ability to do anything else, then they should consider other academic avenues.

Basically, you want to push yourself, but not too hard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dabble in Everything (at first, at least)**

When you start high school, you may not exactly know what you want to focus your time on. That's ok! Try and dabble in a bunch of different things and see what sticks. This isn't limited to joining clubs, though. You can learn new topics online, create projects, or start your own groups. The point here isn't to devote your life to each individual topic, but dabble in each one until you find something you're interested in. This could be athletics, art, robotics, literature, whatever. It doesn't even have to be something conventional. Just try anything that comes to your mind. This is the best time to experiment!

Even if you think of yourself as a hardcore STEM kid or bookworm, it wouldn't hurt to see what's on the other side. If you don't like it, stop doing it! That's the best part about being early in schooling: the repercussions of you giving up something are minimal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Once you find what you like, pursue it relentlessly**

This may take one year, two years, or even longer. You will naturally find yourself leaning towards certain areas over others, and once you find these areas, pursue them to the ends of the earth. Join clubs with dreams of going international. Create companies with the intent of getting on the news. Win competitions, create grand projects, push yourself to goals beyond what you think is impossible. Then push yourself some more.

I can't stress how important this is, for both your own satisfaction and college admissions. This will develop your character and make you feel proud of your work. If you love what you do, your average day won't feel like work. You will always be excited for the next stage, ready to work and pursue your goals. You won't even realize that you are creating a college profile that far exceeds one that is built around securing a spot. When it comes time to write essays, you will have ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM. So many experiences, emotions, successes, and setbacks to talk about. It will come from the heart and pour onto the page. This is the type of writing admissions officers like to see, because **it. shows. character.** When I started writing my Common App essay, I had no problem letting my experiences working with partners and growing a customer base for my company flow onto the page, perfectly harmonized with a storm of emotion and reflection. I knocked out the first draft of my essay in a couple of hours.

Now pursuing your passion isn't going to be all sunshine and rainbows. There will be hard times, there will be exhaustion, and there will be failure. But for every trough in your journey, there is a peak just as large. So get out there and crush it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Put yourself out there**

This is a VERY IMPORTANT one. One of the bigger regrets I have. Don't settle for what's in front of you or what you directly have access to. Go out of your way to give yourself opportunities. Ask questions, inquire, go to events/conferences, meet as many people as possible and learn as much as you can from others. You may find your calling by going out of your way to search for something. This will really help you later in life as well.

I'll give you a real-life example: One day, I asked my computer science teacher if she had any tutoring opportunities available. Turns out she did, and tutoring ended up becoming one of my favorite activities since I like teaching. That's something I would've never done had I not asked her for that opportunity directly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Take initiative**

You need to push yourself to take control and move forward . This is especially applicable for the entrepreneurs out there. I started my own company about four years ago, and being able to lead and bootstrap my way to success was vital to my company's survival. This can apply to anything you do: clubs, competitions, etc. Doing something like starting and growing a club **in a field you enjoy** will both be good for your morale and demonstrate that 'leadership' thing all the colleges are talking about. And the best part is, you won't even know it's happening. It'll just be a necessary task to you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Build strong habits early**

This is starting to sound more like a top 10 life skills list, but it is really important. When you are juggling school, a social life, and extracurriculars, things can pile up, often quite fast once you hit your junior year. Try and get used to sticking to a schedule, using a to-do list, putting down distractions when you study, and taking time off if you're a workaholic. This goes for all the other tips on this list. You want to build good habits while your workload is small, so that once things get stressful, you will be well prepared for it.

You may fall many times on your journey to developing these habits. That's okay! So long as you are resilient and keep at it, you will be fine. The 'F it' mentality will really help you in that respect.

&amp;#x200B;

**Be flexible**

Setting your mind to something is obviously a great skill to have. But sometimes, it can end up hurting you, especially when you ignore opportunities and fun times in exchange for the pursuit of your goals.

I'll give you an example. Let's say you have 4 weeks until a big competition, and you're studying hard for it. Now let's say your friends ask you go to to the movies (corona willing) or a conference in your field of interest pops up in your town. If you aren't flexible, you will miss out on a fun time with your friends, or miss the opportunity of learning about a college that could've been your top choice. Being able to adjust plans on a dime is EXTREMELY useful and can help you take advantage of as many opportunities as possible. In this case, you can gain a really valuable experience by sacrificing a day or less of study time. It's worth it.

Keep in mind that this shouldn't be used to get out of responsibilities. If you have a deadline or something really urgent, it's ok to make sacrifices. But for every time you say 'next time', a new important thing pops up, and before you know it, you will have completely let high school pass you by without a single memorable experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do things by your own accord**

Look, we're all kids here, and most of us need some external force to guide us and push us, whether that be a parent, sibling, friend, or guardian. That's normal. Being a totally self-driven dream chaser isn't a requirement. It does help to use your own motivation to complete tasks, though. While my parents usually allow me freedom, many of my friends have EXTREMELY strict parents that effectively control their entire lives (welcome to the Arab world lol). Some people will only do their homework or go to a club meeting if their parents ask them to. Honestly, the people with the strictest parents are the ones that end up letting loose the most once they are on their own.

Just find a way to push **yourself** to do things. Having the discipline to complete monotonous tasks or tasks you dislike is also important. That takes time, practice, and serious character development though, so don't sweat it if it takes multiple years to fully develop.

&amp;#x200B;

**Play a sport / stay physically active**

I cannot list the number of benefits playing a sport can have. Exercise can relieve stress, make you feel relaxed, give you routine, and (most importantly) make you SWOLE. Playing sports is also a great way to be part of a team and give yourself an outlet outside of traditional extracurriculars. It doesn't have to be competitive, but joining the school team or an outside club could be really fun. I played basketball all four years of high school, and I honestly don't know how I could've done everything I did without it. It was such a great way to break up my other work and academics. It looks good on college applications as well, but that should be your last priority.

You don't have to make a crazy commitment. If you're not an athlete, winning games is nice but shouldn't be your concern. It's about having an outlet and having fun with your sport. It can get as intense or as light as you want it to be, and it's very subjective.

If sports REALLY aren't your thing (and please please try) then at least hit the gym or go for runs. Exercise is so important.

&amp;#x200B;

**Find fulfilling hobbies**

Now playing games and binging Netflix is awesome, but let's be honest, it sucks the life out of you if you do it long enough. Try and find hobbies that require commitment and activity to give yourself something fun **and satisfying** to do. It doesn't have to be some wacky weird hobby that no one does -- sports can definitely fall into this category. As long as you aren't passively consuming media as the primary component of your hobby, it can be a really good way to relieve stress and find some enjoyment outside of work.

This might sound a little weird, but I really enjoy making hot sauces. I grow a variety of peppers and have jars upon jars of homemade hot sauce with vinegar-salt-water ratios scribbled on them. It's something I can commit to and work on without feeling pressure to meet goals or perform, and has really helped me get my mind off of life at times.

  

**Keep the end goal in view**

Having an english essay, a biology lab, 2 tests, a game, a club meet, and competition prep on one day, alongside all the fears and stresses of performance, the future, and regrets can SERIOUSLY overwhelm one. Believe me, I've lived through it. It's very tempting to give it all up and permanently relax. The one thing that has helped me through times like those is visualizing the ideal version of myself. Intrinsically motivated, accomplished, and easy-going. Imagining myself following all these tips and living my best life pushes me to work through all my challenges and make incremental steps forward, no matter how small.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't be afraid to relax**

To end off the billion tips I gave you to split your head in half, I need to make sure you understand that taking time off is vital. You have enjoy the fruits of your labor -- what are you working so hard for otherwise? If you are feeling swamped with work or overwhelmed, don't be afraid to take a minute,   
an hour, a day, or even a week to yourself. I hate hustle culture and how it forces people to grind constantly. Going into college as a CS major, it seems like hustling is the only game and constant stress is the only award, with burnout as a participation trophy. If you don't take some time to yourself, you WILL collapse.

You don't even have fill this time with 'productive' activities. Binge a new show, eat something sugary, chill with friends or a significant other, just relax. Don't worry about productivity, you've earned some off time.

&amp;#x200B;

**!!!!!!!DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS!!!!!!!**

I'm leaving this one last because it's one of the most important. I spent way too much time looking at what other people did and how I was so far behind them. You may not realize that the person you compare yourself to has the same feelings of insecurity and hopelessness that you do. This goes both ways -- to someone else, you may seem like a shining star that is so far ahead of them, not factoring your true feelings of inferiority into their comparison.

Keep your own goals in mind and compare yourself to **them,** not others. Compare yourself to your past and how far you have come. This will save you a world of hardship and give you the confidence you need to crush your activities, and eventually, college applications.

# Keep in Mind -- A T20 Is Never Guaranteed 

The main reason I made this is to make sure the classes of 2022 and beyond don't suffer what many of us have: feelings of hopelessness and invalidation once years of work are thrown away in a string of rejections. No matter how passionate or impressive you are, rejections from all your top choices can happen through no fault of your own. This way, though, your accomplishments are independent of your college prep journey, and you can look back on high school with satisfaction. You enjoyed your years, and you still accomplished a lot.

If I was to summarize the goal of this post in one sentence, it would be this: 

# You should work to chase your dreams. Getting into college is a bonus.

I wish y'all luck with everything. To my fellow seniors, I hope we can still take something from this and apply it to our lives. The chance to better yourself isn't over when you finish high school, so let's go out there and make the best of our college years, gap years, or whatever else we choose to do!"
meujhw,7,2021-03-28,Where should I go?? (UCB vs GT),sindys_struggles,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/meujhw/where_should_i_go_ucb_vs_gt/,"Hi I'm and international student and I'm currently trying to decide on where to go for college. 

I'm in between UC Berkeley and Georgia Tech as a CS major.  (For UC Berkeley, I would be a prospective CS major until I earn a 3.3 GPA in the college of letters and science)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the points I want to make is that:

* Since I'm an international student, I think the internship opportunities are important to consider
* My family can afford both, but if I go to UC Berkeley I would have to really restrict my spendings than I currently use
   * also, I would be going there alone, unlike in Georgia Tech my family can move with me
* I'm not sure how UC Berkeley is, but I really loved the Georgia Tech campus when I visited. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me some advice about anything you might think would be helpful for me!!!"

For context, I’m currently a freshmen studying CS, and I’m just kind of worried about my future in the industry. The reason I say this is because I basically spent my first year doing nothing in terms of networking, personal projects etc. I’m really worried because a lot of people I know have already gotten internships (as first years), and I’m not even sure I’ll be able to get one for next summer. I was just wondering if I’m over worrying, and what you guys think I should do to better prep me for internship applications. I know this is a very general question, and I appreciate all response.

I really didn't want to code forever and wanted to find roles that were different. I have a lot of background in IT infastructuture, cyber security, linux and servers. I've also done internships in the past more focused on client relations and business growth. 

I am currently getting my AWS Cloud Architect: Associate certification and even preparing for my OSCP certification. I was planning on working in cyber security/  cloud infastructuture after college. 

But the issue I'm facing now is I actually got interviews for some medium sized companies for a systems reliability engineer intern role and also one for a solutions engineer intern. The SRE role was new to me and really interesting as it seemed like a combination of the development and networking infastructuture of things. But the solutions engineer role was also very interesting and something up my ally as I am very extroverted and do want to go into more management positions in the future. 

I think the salaries are similar for both roles. If not, then the solutions engineer might actually pay higher if the information I found was correct. 
My question is if I should choose the solutions engineer intern position over the SRE internship. I don't know which one will get me faster to my goals of management level positions with technical background. So product manager, or other management level roles. Any advice would be appreciated. I didn't want to take a non technical position if it didn't further my career goals. Thank you in advance for any help!"

mewpv5,7,2021-03-28,I finally got a job as a mechanical engineer,LousyEngineer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mewpv5/i_finally_got_a_job_as_a_mechanical_engineer/,"Reddit Thank you. Without your advice, I may not have gotten my first real engineering job.  I want to share a summary of my experience in hopes that it may help guide or give ideas to those who are struggling, will enter the struggle soon, or are still in college.

I'm a mechanical engineering major and struggled finding internships during school. I didn't even know what an internship was until I transferred to UNI from CC my 3rd year.  I applied to maybe 50 and got nothing but the generic ""thank you for your time"" response smh. It didn't really phase me that I didn't get an internship until my final year at uni because I asked everyone and 80% (some random number i just came up with) mentioned they had 1 or 2 internships already. I panicked, upped my efforts and created an excel sheet to keep track of my applications. My final semester I was able to score an internship in the aerospace industry as a quality engineering intern (after \~100-200 applications). At this time, my only experience on my resume was some engineering rocketry club experience (tbh I did like 2 things in it because I was really busy with part time work (pizza delivery guy) and school work). I applied to everything from internships of any kind of engineering (civil, mechanical, quality, mfg, even drafting positions). Anything that was remotely relevant to engineering. Quality is what hit. 

I started an internship at an aerospace company and I thought it was cool that I got this opportunity but in all honesty it wasn't that rewarding.  Little relevant to actual engineering mostly  just paper pushing but it let me get an idea of what the engineering and manufacturing world was like and I am very appreciative of the opportunity I had. I was 'promoted' to a higher role after  a couple of months (couldn't get the engineering role because no vacancy and this all happened in 2020 right around the time covid hit). I was working about 40 hours a week at this place both as an intern and the promotion job. 

Covid hit this place hard and I (as well as a couple hundred other people) got laid off sometime around August 2020. I was devastated. I thought I had a for sure thing going on and instantly I became a loser. I applied everywhere in the country  (US) keeping an excel file of everywhere I applied. I was determined this time.. I would get the real engineering job. 

Reality was starting to hit after a couple months of nothing but dead ends. I think I got 2 interviews and they just ghosted me. Kept going on LinkedIn for their jobs section and found myself scrolling through the ""people you may know"" list and kept seeing everyone I knew from school who already had an engineering job. The anxiety and depression was hitting me. I felt like a complete loser, I couldn't believe that I couldn't get a job after college. I saw people I was tutoring who had jobs. Will I be one of those nightmare stories on Reddit where they can't get a job after years?? 

All the junior engineers at my old internship told me they got their jobs by doing temporary contracts until the company got them in, one guy told me he was determined to get a job as an engineering by sneaking in as a regular employee and working his way up. IT WORKED. He was a press operator (manual labor pretty much) and told the engineers he had his degree. 6 months in and he was promoted to MFG engineer.  I used this  tactic and applied everywhere I could think of with any similar role (quality inspector, operators, entry level CNC machinist or machine operator, cad user jobs, internships). 

I hit a really good number \~80th place I applied to offered me an interview for a 25 hour/week internship sometime In October. I half bombed the interview (I screwed up on the easiest question ""what is your strength""). I replied ""oof... that's a good question), to which i redeemed myself on the weakness by saying I'm pretty bad when it comes to communication but I'm eager to learn.  I told him if I get the job I want to be swarmed with work and be busy as possible, I don't want a job where I'm sitting around twiddling my thumbs,  I'll help you guys out if I get to learn.

I got the internship. I took a massive paycut and made maybe 1/2 of what I was making at that promoted job. I sucked it up. I was eager at work. There were several other interns that solely focused on the jobs they were given. I  hustled and kept asking the boss for more work and told him i was interested in several projects. A couple of months in, the engineering manager and the VP liked my work and offered me a position.  It's a small company, doing exactly the kind of work I wanted to do (design, prototype, solidworks, machining etc). I get to design stuff and see it actually get made.

Tips I realized for finding a job (some of which may work even if you're not an engineering major).

1. Create a log of where you apply to. It'll remind you of where you're at and keep you in check.  you don't want to go from applying to 5 places a day to 5 places a month (which I noticed a lot of people end up doing).
2. You want that high paying career job but lack the experience? Good luck, the competition is insane. Apply to lower tier positions that are relevant to the actual job you want. If you want to be a quality engineer, try becoming a quality inspector. Manufacturing engineer? try becoming a machine operator. Business person? maybe try going into sales or something?? Every main job should have some sort of support around it that can become valid experience it DOESN'T have to be an internship.
3. The reality is, cover letters help but sadly we are numbers.  Also, I realized tailoring my resume to a very specific ad was not worth my time as much as creating 2-3 ""HIGH QUALITY"" resumes that are relevant to 2-3 different types of roles I wanted to get into.  And send them out in high numbers. Around 80th application was the one that gave me the last internship that turned into a role. Which in all honesty is not that high of a number. I've noticed 300 seems to be the sweet spot. 
4. How many times have you heard or read that ""It's about WHO you know""? Most people giving tips on here tell you to network network NETWORK. The reality is.. you are a JUNIOR w/ No experience and therefore almost no possibility for networking.  Your colleagues with jobs are probably all juniors too with little to know power for recommendation or offering jobs. At least for me with my understandment.. it felt impossible to network.. I felt like I kept reading posts that give you optimal scenarios or fantasies like to just ""network and have lunch ""with the ceo of x company and you will get that job. Which is why I go back to tip # 2 I had. If you're in the company as a regular employee, you might get to network with the higher ups. Companies are WAY MORE WILLING to offer the position to someone whose work ethic they already know. By network, I wouldn't say have lunch with the person. I would say ""tell the person good morning"", or express interest in the work place. Always ask for more even if it is without extra pay. They will take note of this. 

Note: These tips are not set in stone. Your mileage may vary. Some people love cover letters and taking an hour to create a resume for 1 ad. I found this was just not for me.  Some people are great at networking, I am awkward and am not.  It is much easier for someone like me to ""network"" with people I already know, rather than someone I do not (like going to those conventions or whatever) ."

Letters of Recommendation

HS French Teacher: 9/10 - Was practically my gay mentor throughout high school. Was also really close and would always go to his class after school to joke around and chat. 

AP Gov Teacher: 7/10 - Only knew her for a couple of weeks when I asked her to write a recommendation letter for me. However, I was really outspoken in her class during discussions and surprised her a lot with my arguments. She loved my arguments and how I always participated. She said that she could relate to my struggles and would be happy to write a recommendation. She also once said my argument in a debate sounded like one R.B.G would make. :)

Mock Trial Coach / LA County Superior Court Judge: 8/10 - Knew her for three years during the mock trial club program. She loved how I formed ideas and arguments during discussions for and about the various cases. I also was always able to make her laugh and I believe I formed a fond friendship with her. She offered me a internship many times. 
​

Interviews

Georgetown - 7/10: Interviewer seemed to really like me. I made him laugh a lot and I intrigued him with the story of my struggles. We bonded over our love for nature and hiking. Also made sure to connect how we both really want to help people and the communities around us and how goals align in that way. 

​

Essays

Common App Personal Statement: (Worked on and edited over in the course of 3 months) I wrote about the struggles I faced during HS such as family member addiction battle, discovering my sexuality while feeling alone and scared in the world, and then learning from these struggles and helping people who are going through the same thing by speaking at group/family therapy like sessions. I believe my writing was excellent and I think it’s what got me in. (9/10)

UC Essays: (Worked on and edited over the course of 2 months) Similar writing topics as Common App, but also wrote about mock trial club and student academic mentoring. (8/10)
​
Supplementals: (Worked on and edited over the course of 1 month) For GW I wrote about LGBTQ+ rights, something that is a passion of mine.

Additional Information:

I don’t know if I did this right or if anything I did is against the rules, sorry Mods in advance. Um...GW is giving me a financial aid offer of 70k (just from grants) and I’m pretty sure GW is where I’m headed. As the GPA reflects all years of HS, during my freshman and senior year, my family was suffering from a lot of conflicts and thus my grades took a hit. Then once the conflicts were resolved, my grades improved. And I started to receive straight A’s my junior and senior years, so I think it shows a strong upward trend. For the comments let’s be nice and spread love. :) 
If anyone has any questions, I’ll answer them in the comments."

Also learned I won't be funded this summer so I'll be forced to pay tuition to maintain status as an international student if I don't find a job. Would love some help!,smol-brown-girl,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/mexcfr/cs_grad_student_trying_to_break_into_ux_research/,"Hey everyone! I'm a CS/HCI graduate student currently (DESPERATELY) applying to UX Research internships, and would love feedback on my resume. I'm so glad I found this sub, spent all of today harvesting wisdom and improved this draft by a LOT.

For context: I'm trying to break into the UX industry - I come from a Computer Science background, and my prior industry experience is in Software Engineering (SWE).

***Specific feedback requests:***

* I wanted to nest all the projects I've been working on as a Grad Research Assistant (GRA) under that ""experience"" - I tried adding the line above to give context. Does it make sense?
* I have no idea how to generalize my work under the \[Well Known Company\] project (maybe bc I've been staring at this document for 6 hours straight...), please advise!
* I was a student mentor for high school students in the research lab over summer -  I didn't think it would make sense to add a ""Volunteer"" section
* The SWE intern experience is very vague because that isn't the main focus in this resume. I included it to show I worked in a corporate environment, and to justify the Technical skills.
* Overall: tightening bullets - It's very wordy and I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot
* I also want to include a ""publications available on request"" but i'm unsure where it'd go! Any overall formatting advice would also be helpful.

Appreciate any feedback &amp; advice in advance!!!

mexmkv,5,2021-03-28,Crying at the thought of my family,Kodek02,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mexmkv/crying_at_the_thought_of_my_family/,"I’ve moved out of the family house and I still get so much anxiety from my family. Growing up I felt my identity just shadowed my mothers since I look exactly like her and her father who died before she was born. 
People have even mistaken me for her. My mother even tells me that I’ll ruin her reputation if I don’t adhere to certain things like dressing business casual when going out even to pick her up at McDonald’s.

Not only that but my family always undermined my success. 
For example, when I was the only one who got an internship that my sister and I applied for everyone thought I used my uncle as a reference who has big connections with the company who did the internship. My older sister and my mother was telling everybody I didn’t deserve the intern and I only got it because of my uncle but little did they know at the time I never used him as a reference. 

My family also believe I’m a big failure at life that does drugs.

Ex. My family members all separately spoke to me about drugs and why I shouldn’t do it, including my aunts and uncles. 

I don’t do drugs and I always tell my siblings not to do it even going as far as showing them statistics on it.

I’m also horrible at math and had a c the last semester of high school... my mom told everyone I had Fs and that I was failing my classes. My other classes I actually had A’s in. My mother often excused my sisters from chores because they were smarter than me. I had to do chores before my hw where as my sisters could start right after getting home.

I was always stuck babysitting my older sister when she went on dates with her bf. Much of the time my parents relied on me to take care of her because she was very mischievous.

My older sister spent most of the time bullying me and  forced me to do her chores. 

My mom planned all my sisters graduations except for mine. I planned mine and had to invite everyone... they all said they couldn’t make it.

When my younger sister graduated 3 years later everyone asked me when I was graduating high school...

My parents would always make extra effort for my sisters and even still do. 

Recently my younger sister 21yo has been calling me and harassing me about coming home even though she knows I’m going to school full time and don’t want to be around our toxic family. Even claiming I’m ignoring her when she said she didn’t want to talk to me  and wanted her space.

My sisters believe that i have a golden spoon even though I’ve always gotten the least stuff that is cheap.

Life at home was really toxic and sometimes I get overwhelmed when something reminds me of my family. I’ve moved out and am living with my bf but I feel like he is just getting annoyed of me. 

What should I do to cope with my anxiety and emotions? Am I just too sensitive?"

My goal right out of grad school would be to get an sde job 

Everyone says UCI would be my best bet but it's a 15 month program so I'm worried about the job prospects although I know it's California so there will be a lot of companies and what not

I am a fresher so the only experience I have are my internships and the current one is a 6 month long internship (its for my final semester in college so no classes for me I'll be graded based on this and the seniors at the company have told us that this is exactly how the job would be if I want to continue as full time software engineer there)

This sub has really helped a lot through this admission cycle

Asking for advice about the path to take.,art_vandelay_42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/meztit/moving_from_mech_engineering_to_computer_science/,"So I'm currently in the third year of a mechanical engineering degree. I'm on an integrated course and I'm supposed to be going on a year long placement next year, followed by an integrated master's degree in mechanical engineering. I've been applying for placements left, right and centre, and I still am, however at this point I've realised engineering isn't exactly how I thought it would be. Whilst I enjoy elements of it, and I recognise that there will always be elements to a career you don't enjoy doing, I've realised at this point that it's not just that and there are too many things that I don't really enjoy. Mechanical/aerospace engineering definitely isn't where I want to go, I'm sure of that.

Anyway, I've figured out that the direction I want to head in is computer science. I've always enjoyed the coding elements of my degree so far and outside of my degree I find myself interested in software engineering. I do also like the flexibility it offers with you hypothetically only really needing a laptop and internet connection to do a lot of your work. 

So I've been thinking about how I can make this transition. First of all I'm going to finish off the last semester of this year and change my course to just a Bachelor's degree. (In the UK so a bachelor's is 3 years for me) After that, whilst I have some experience in C and MATLAB, I recognise that I'm going to have to invest some time into learning other coding languages and advancing my skills. I figure I'll take a gap year to earn some money and travel too and in that time I can learn more about computer science and figure out if I still enjoy it as I get deeper into it. I already have a good base in the maths so I have that to my advantage. I am considering then applying for a Master's degree the following year because my interest is more in software engineering than just basic web design, and from what I've read so far, I get the impression that it's advantageous to have a degree in CS to get into that industry.

So I'd like to hear any thoughts on this path idea and any reccomendations, but also, I recognise the importance of experience and I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this. I have no experience in the engineering industry so far. My searching for a placement was going to be my first experience in the industry, but since my plans have now changed I'm back to sqaure 1 and need to find my first bit of experience. Now because I want to go into computer science it would make sense to get an internship more tailored to this indusrty, but until I have the relevant skills, I recognise that getting something is going to be a challenge. I do want to make use of this gap year though as it would be a good time to get some internships, so I'm open to any reccomendations anyone has about how I could fill this time. Should I try and get some internships specific to my bachelor's degree even if it's not really something I want to persure? And should I leave internships in computer science for a later date when I'm doing the master's degree? Or does anyone have any ideas for how I might still be able to do some computer science stuff in this gap year whilst I'm preparing for the Master's.

The research internship is AI &amp; Computer Vision related, it's backed by one of the earlier AI start-up companies in my country and my professor has mentioned that this internship could potentially lead to further opportunities with them where they might even pay for my PhD. The other company is more open-ended so they said I'll be placed wherever they feel I'd fit the best but it looks like I'll probably be more of a back-end engineer and they have also stated that this could lead to further opportunities in their company. The corporate internship pays about 3.5 times more than the research internship. So I'm kind of in this dilemma to pick one. What do you guys think?"

Started college pursuing a communications degree my first two years because I was not sure of what I wanted to do, then switched to pursue a BS in Data Analytics at the start of my Junior year.

The first semester and a half of my degree was fine. I was introduced to Python, SQL, and a bunch of concepts in the field. Pandemic hits and we switch to a terrible remote learning model. Our professors were already hit or miss, but this just made things much worse second semester. I managed to get an internship as a Junior Data Analyst in the summer following Junior year, but very little to no coding was done. I was basically handed task and told to create infographics while cleaning data from huge excel sheets I was given. Around this time my father died, and my focus around the internship dwindled as I had to take some time away. 

Fast-forward a bit to the beginning of Senior year and everything is still remote. Classes still were not organized well, professors were terrible, and I was not learning anything. Just kind of did the work for grades and moved on. I spoke to other students in my field and they agreed that they felt as if they met no requirements to begin work. 

I chalked it up to bad timing in being a student during the pandemic, and turned my attention to grad school. I go to school in New York and my school offers a Data Science Masters degree, so I thought I'd do that as it's still a field of interest. After doing some research in my school's Data Science MS degree, I realized how fucked I am. Not only are the professors bottom of the barrell based on student reviews, but the prerequisites are some things I haven't touched since last being in person or before that. I am familiar with a ton of different terms within my area of study, but can by no means give you a proper run down on them. At this point I should be super comfortable in my understanding with some elements of probability and statistics, but I'm just not. I should have all the fundamental knowledge of Python and SQL, but I just don't. In fact, I can't even put it on my resume anymore because I essentially forgot everything. 

I've been going on too long and am losing focus of the initial purpose of this post, sorry. What do you think my options are? I have close to a 4.0 GPA in my major, 3.5 GPA overall, but it's not reflective of the information I currently hold. I want to try and transfer to another program since the professors here are universally described as below average, but I feel like there are other areas of concern I need to address first such as having a plan. My initial goal was to work with a sports franchise in some facet by working with data, but I'm a complete and utter joke to the job market right now; and I'm scared if I enter Grad school I'll get punched in the face. Thanks in advance.

P.S 

Forgot to mention that because of my father’s death, his life insurance policy is offering to pay a portion of my tuition for the next 3 years. This is one of my biggest factors in considering pursuing a masters in the Fall."

I recently got hired at a small company that makes some technology that is used by large companies. We are having issues finding a job title because of the type of work I do. We are trying to avoid ""intern"" and stuff like that, as it's a full time position, not an internship.

I currently:
- Do R&amp;D for the company. From testing to multiple forms of engineering
- I have been moving the small company to an MRP system and will be in charge of the integrations of quick books, etc.
- I take care of the shipping, from labels, packing lists, setting up the board, etc.
- I help customers in the sense of trouble shooting and repairing the devices
- I build and repair devices that are in the shop.


I have some other tasks I am slowly taking charge of as well, and will continue to take on different tasks. I essentially ""wear many hats"" from R&amp;D being a tech, learning some MRP/accounting stuff, all the way to being the front office guy.

The biggest part of those is the R&amp;D and the customer front of being the support/repair guy.

I recently got hired at a small company that makes some technology that is used by large companies. We are having issues finding a job title because of the type of work I do. We are trying to avoid ""intern"" and stuff like that, as it's a full time position, not an internship.

I currently:
- Do R&amp;D for the company. From testing to multiple forms of engineering
- I have been moving the small company to an MRP system and will be in charge of the integrations of quick books, etc.
- I take care of the shipping, from labels, packing lists, setting up the board, etc.
- I help customers in the sense of trouble shooting and repairing the devices
- I build and repair devices that are in the shop.


I have some other tasks I am slowly taking charge of as well, and will continue to take on different tasks. I essentially ""wear many hats"" from R&amp;D being a tech, learning some MRP/accounting stuff, all the way to being the front office guy.

The biggest part of those is the R&amp;D and the customer front of being the support/repair guy.

Could you guys help me find a job title for the position?"

Hey! So me and my best friend are going to the same university with the same majors (we both are interested in healthcare and this school suits our needs). The thing is, we applied for housing, but we apparently applied too late so we didn’t get the same room together. Instead we got rooms directly next to each other. We are in the process of nicely asking our roommates to swap together so that we could room together. Only thing is, should we even room together? I don’t want to lose her as a best friend and I hear too many stories of best friend roommates gone wrong. 

Ik you’re probably saying “don’t room with your best friend, you will end up despising her and not meeting new people.” Well, we both discussed that we will have to branch out and we recognize and hear bad stories about rooming with your best friend. I already know 2 clubs I’m going to join in university so I don’t think meeting new people will be difficult since I’m an extrovert...

The problem I have is, we both have the same major meaning we will have the same classes, and we’re in the same hall. I’m scared I’m going to get tired of her. That sounds bad but I literally get tired of my sister sometimes lol. Me and my best friend are in the same hs health internship right now but it’s not like we live together. This is going to be totally different. Will it get overbearing? I know like 3 friends who roomed with their best friends and everything is fine. Then I log onto social media and Reddit and see horror best friend stories and now I have anxiety over losing my friend. 

Should I room with my her, or leave the roommate swap alone? We already discussed dorm shopping together and I’d rather have her as a roommate than anybody else. I honestly don’t think we would clash because we’re extremely alike but who knows. People literally think we’re sisters or twins because we’re always together and we apparently look similar. Tips?"

I was good in academics till 11th. Fucked it up and barely passed. Now I'll be starting 12th this year.

I have had a huge interest in technology, mainly in programming, webdev, ui/ux design, etc. and I have done tons of projects in these things (since I was in 9th).

But the point is my academics have not been looking pretty. I have decided not to give JEE, BITSAT, COMEDK or any other such entrance exam nor have I ever aimed to go to IITs or such things. I'll be honest, I can't. And my parents have supported my decision as well.

But on the other hand my programming is good. Not to brag, I have some decent projects. Making into a tier-1,2,3 college seems impossible, I can't redo my 11th syllabus again.

But I've promised myself a 95+ % in 12th boards.

I've looked in colleges in Bombay, Bangalore, Hyderabad but most of them have pretty tough and competetive exams.

What are my options? Guide me fellow Indians. 

Plus, if it helps. I'm from Punjab, if that helps. I was looking into Chandigarh University + plus internships and side projects in the 4 years of university? Will that help.

Edit - Are there any colleges accepting 12th boards?

Side Question - Will I be able to bag a good job in tech firms with a degree from bad college or a non-btech degree but good skills?

It would mean the world to me if you can guide me. I've had sleepless nights since passing 11th."

mf7141,3,2021-03-28,Feeling uncertain about succeeding in grad school/not sure if it's worth it,flamingos4sale,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/mf7141/feeling_uncertain_about_succeeding_in_grad/,"Hey all, 

Basically just another imposter syndrome post, but hoping I can find others who have experienced a similar situation to mine. Might be quite long, but bear with me.

So, I've been accepted to a masters program for this fall that I hope will help me get closer to working in the field I want to be in. I've always been interested in environmental issues/conservation but I didn't actually realize that it's what I really wanted to focus on until the last year or so. I did my undergrad in political science and the masters program is in sustainability policy, so my goal is to eventually work in the environmental policy realm.

The thing is: I had a pretty rough time throughout my undergrad. I moved away from home first year to pursue a science degree, but had to move back and switch majors for many reasons (repeated concussions/ health issues, uncertainty about science degree, financial issues). After switching into political science and a new school I did pretty well my first year due to recovering from the concussion setback and not having to work. I was diagnosed with ADHD that same year which explained a lot about my experience throughout high school and first year, and I was finally able to obtain the resources I needed all along. But then, I kind of fell off (getting concussed again, family problems, etc) and started failing my courses. At one point I dropped out for awhile and wasn't sure I was ever going to go back, let alone graduate. I'd never even considered graduate school as an option. Fast forward a few years and I've finally graduated this past December (yay) and I did amazingly well in my last 3 or four semesters (80s-90s average), which is what earned me my letters of recommendation and a spot in the masters program. 

I was super excited about the opportunity at first, and of course I still am, but I've started thinking... am I even cut out for it? I know it's a classic case of imposter syndrome and that if I apply myself I'll probably do fine, I know they accepted me for a reason, but I just can't shake the uncertainty. Throughout all my years of schooling I've always been smart enough to basically ""get by"", but the ADHD and social anxiety and not feeling as good as the other students has led me to never quite take the initiative I feel that I need to be truly successful in grad school. I've always done very well on assignments as I think I am a decent writer, but I've never really been one to actively participate in class (out of fear). I do my best to avoid presentations as I have a horrible fear of public speaking, and I am the classic ADHD procrastinator. Additionally, I feel my years of being chronically ill/uncertain about my life path have made me miss a lot of the opportunities that would have helped me when entering grad school (internships, volunteer work, research projects). I feel as though all of the grad students at the same level as me that I've seen or spoken to have a ton of experience in the field already, or at the very least know what they want their research to focus on, whereas I'm basically going in blind. I know that I eventually want to work in conservation policy, but that's pretty much it. I don't even know if I have the base knowledge of the program/field that I need, since only one or two classes I took in undergrad were focused on environmental perspectives.

On top of all of this, grad school is super expensive (I'd be paying out-of-state tuition as an international student if I don't get the grant I'm hoping for) and I've just been offered a salaried job (not in my field, no real opportunities for advancement, not sure I'd even enjoy it after a year or two). So there's also the fact that I'd feel dumb for sacrificing some guaranteed financial stability in order to go into debt for grad school, simply based on the possibility that it would MAYBE help me break into my desired field afterwards. Plus if my fears about not being good enough for school are true, then I'll have given it up for nothing. Then again, I don't want to regret not going to school and losing my chance to do something I love.

Sorry this post is so long. Truthfully, I don't even know what kind of advice I'm looking for. Reassurance that I'll be fine in school and I should go? For someone to give me a reality check and tell me I shouldn't? Solidarity in the fact that others feel the same way/have experienced something similar? Honestly anything would help at this point, I've been so stuck in my head about it and could use any outside perspective that isn't either my friends saying ""follow your dreams!"" or my parents calling me stupid for even considering it. Thank you guys in advance for anything you could say.

TL;DR: ADHD/ social anxiety/ health issues/ not taking enough initiative/ feeling inadequate had me coasting through my undergrad and now that I find myself with the opportunity to go to grad school, I'm not sure that I have the knowledge, experience, or qualities to be successful. If I finished my masters it might bring me closer to doing something that I love, but it is expensive and I would be turning down a salaried job (nowhere near my field) in order to go. Is it worth it?"

I'll list some pros and cons for each school and some questions.

***SLO Pros-*** Viewed very highly in the world CS (so I've heard), great internship and job opportunities, located in a nice town with great weather.

***SLO Cons-*** 3 hours away from home (being close to home is important for personal reasons), 48k total tuition for 4 years ( will have to take out loans), won't see my dogs often:(

***CPP Pros-*** 50 min from home, tuition will be covered by aid if I do not dorm( and if I do dorm it will be cheaper than SLO),

***CPP Cons-*** Have heard its not as good as SLO in regards to internships and jobs

I know that for CS it's very much, ""you get what you put into it"", but is the quality of education and opportunities at SLO really worth $48,000 in debt over free tuition at CPP?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

mf8qt2,0,2021-03-28,CW: SA I think I was groomed by my childhood music teacher,throwaway35215321,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/mf8qt2/cw_sa_i_think_i_was_groomed_by_my_childhood_music/,"TLDR I'm (22M) a classical musician, and I think the mentor (55 M) that I had from age 14-22 groomed me. The parts that's litigious is under the line; everything else is just context

So I begin realizing I have a talent around age 14, and begin taking private lessons with the teacher of my mom's best friend (Kathleen)'s kids--who is also nationally recognized as a teacher that connects talented students to major institutions; we'll call the teacher Tom. Right away, he sees something in me, and I become his star student basically from day 1. At my first lesson, Tom asks me to wait in my mom's car while he and she talk about something private. They talk for over 45 minutes, and when my mom comes back to the car, she won't tell me what they talked about. Whatever, I'm 14; adults have secrets...NBD.

A few months later, it becomes big time local news: area \[music\] teacher accused of sexual abuse of a minor, DA looking for more victims. Shit that's Tom. Alright, I talk to my mom, and she's like I talked with Kathleen after Tom told me about the accusation, and my mom assured me Kathleen knew the plaintiff, and she believed Tom given the character of the kid and inconsistencies in his story. 

Again, whatever--I'm 14, and my parents trust Tom, plus he is the best teacher in the area, AND on top of that, it was court ordered that there was always another adult in the room from one of my parents to my adult siblings to Kathleen, so the cost-benefit analysis made sense. I can't get in trouble if there's someone else there, I'm getting like next-level good, and the community and industry stood by Tom. 

When I'm 15, he's convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The court, however, felt there was a miscarriage of justice, as the plaintiff perjured himself multiple times across the two trials--but according to the law in our state, a victim of criminal sex abuse who was under 18 at the time didn't have to keep a consistent timeline, even though this plaintiff's story changed from the abuse happening at age 11 to the abuse happening at age 17. This was not the spirit of the law, which was made to protect young children from not remembering if an abuse happened at age 3 or age 4--not if a now adult plaintiff can't remember if he was a middleschooler or a senior in highschool. The transcripts read like a who's who of stories that were demonstrably false, so the court felt that Tom's attorney was underprepared and misrepresented him by not more ardently defending him, so the court commuted the sentence to 10 months with good behavior. He served about 9 1/2 months in state prison. The court also ordered that he could continue teaching minors as long as an adult guardian was still in the room. He actually gave me a lesson over the phone from jail because I needed a musical triage before an important performance.

He maintains his innocence the entire time, and my family is a very socially-conscious family, so we believe that someone who has served their time--especially if they maintain their innocence--deserves their chance at a life after prison. Same rules are in effect after his time served, so nothing can really go awry. We feel we've stuck by someone who was wrongfully convicted, and I'm still benefiting from having one of the best teachers of highschool students in the industry teaching me each week. 

My senior year of highschool, however, things begin to go sideways. By this point, his reputation has been fairly thoroughly tarnished, and so there were only a handful of families still studying with him when before, he had a 9-month waitlist to be in his studio after hearing you unless you were incredible from the get go. So things begin to get a little tough for him, so he starts leaning more heavily onto the lives of his students' families. Whatever, he was casual friends with my parents and he and I were really close, so we welcome in to the family. We celebrate holidays together. We get each other birthday and Christmas gifts; he becomes a bona fide family friend. All until the spring of 2016 (my senior year of highschool), I got into an ivy league that had a world-renowned music school. On top of that they gave me basically all of the money I asked for, and my parents could afford the greatly reduced tuition without having to undertake any loans. Perfect--why wouldn't I go to one of the most influential schools in the world, especially one that has international competition winners coming out of their music school. This didn't sit right with Tom. At this point, I had taken on so much importance in his life, he began to project his own insecurities and feelings of mediocrity onto me. He tells me it was a mistake that the ivy league accepted me, and that it would be unsustainable for me because my raw talent did the heavy lifting in my acceptance over my actual abilities. He said that I wouldn't be able to stay afloat, much less make an impression during my undergrad, and I should instead go to his alma mater, a non-flagship state school in Alabama (that in his defense made some economical sense as they were going to legit pay me a stipend on top of full tuition remission to go there because of my ACT scores alone and then an additional stipend from the music school for housing--it was a sweet deal, but I would've been 2 hours from any sort of city (and I'm a city girl who's only live in major metropolitan areas, so being so far removed from what felt like civilization for me was daunting, plus I'm queer as a three dollar bill, and wasn't trying to get hatecrimed during my undergrad), and the academic and musical rigor was far less exacting than the ivy league into which I was accepted. On top of that, I grew up in a very achievement-oriented house (my mom is a CEO, and my dad is an internationally recognized physician and researcher), where academic and career accolades were considered sacrosanct. They weren't intolerant or dismissive of the value of a state education (both of my siblings went to regular state schools in Philadelphia), they just felt that I was given an opportunity to go to a MAJOR institution, and they didn't want me to miss out on the chance to thrive in the ivy leagues. So, I decide to go to the ivy league. 

That's when Tom first begins getting abusive. He begins berating me and telling me that I'm a dumbass who is so focused on brand-name degrees that I'll lose sight of the art, and I'll therefore never amount to anything. Keep in mind this is someone whom my family supported through the hardest years of his life, and his response to his star student going to one of the best schools of music in the country was to berate me. This set off my parents. They were like who the fuck do you think you are? Try it again, and we'll cut you off (they were helping to support him financially), and necessity caused Tom to be like fine, but from that day on my parents were wary of Tom. 

So I begin my freshman year at the ivy league. It was definitely playing in the big leagues, but I felt I was ready to bat. Things are sailing smoothly, the faculty likes me, I'm getting really good in music theory and aural skills (which were not something in which I was previously immersed, so there was a learning curve--but that's what going to school is about: learning and growing). I'm happy and excelling. Then, in January of my freshman year (2017), I was sexually assaulted by a close friend from the extremely small cohort of my class. This triggered my first manic episode, and I begin cycling, ramping up my drug use and sexual activities, and failing all of my classes. The Title IX office used my cycling as credence that I wasn't actually assaulted because I immediately had sex with someone the night I was assaulted (which is a catalogued response to sexual trauma, where someone feels the need to assert their sexual agency, so they'll go have sex even though they were just assaulted) and subsequently used drugs and sex as a coping mechanism, and that I just got too drunk that night to remember what I did and then felt ashamed so I reported a false claim. During this time, I let Tom know about the assault--before I actually told my parents--and he shares with me that he was raped by a CO in prison, and it becomes a bonding experience over our shared trauma. 

That's when Tom begins to become possessive. He begins calling every day for hours on end, and when I tell him I can't facilitate calling him every day as I'm having a mental health crisis and trying not to drop out of school, which has become insurmountably difficult as my assailant is in all of my classes. I become unresponsive and shut down, as one is wont to do while cycling and in the aftermath of sexual trauma. Cue suicide watch and medical withdrawal. So I'm isolated from my friends who are all away at college and focused on their studies, and Tom is the only person who has the time to call me every day. We become extremely close, and he invited me to his house in GA (he moved back home my senior year of college--which is another thing that I think made him want me to go to his alma mater, because I'd only be 45 minutes away from him). I tell him I don't have the time, but I'll consider it the following summer.

I eventually transfer schools because why would I stay at a school that called me a drunken slut and wouldn't accommodate me to be in other sections than the one my assailant was in. I go to a school were my cousin, who is the same type of musician as I, is on faculty, from which my brother graduated, and on which my grandfather was a board member emeritus. Things are good, I get placed with their professor who is the internationally known pedagogue in our field, and so smooth sailing ahead. A long story short, I get continuously retraumatized as my undiagnosed bipolar disorder puts me in situations where my safety is perilous--basically strung out sex meet ups where I am fucked passed out, and then it breeds a cycle of shame and need to dull the pain, which becomes a positive feedback loop. As my adult confidante, I told Tom basically what were the tail tell signs of mania, which he then used to shame me and keep me under his control--basically implying he'd tell my parents about my sex and drug use if I didn't placate his need for attention.

This just becomes the way we interact. He calls for hours a day, every day, I can't get out of it because he'll either ridicule me into submission or threaten to out my cries for help to my parents (but not like your son is in need of medical intervention--like your son is a crackhead sex addict). This further compounds my desperation, and I become suicidal after I'm raped again my senior year of college. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Things become potentially litigious the summer after my senior year of college: Because of the turmoil in the aftermath of my being raped, I decided to forgo applying to graduate school until the next fall--plus I had a handful of credits from transferring to complete beforehand that I figured I could just finish in the fall as opposed to doing summer school or jampacking my schedule. To help me prepare for my auditions, Tom invited me to his house in Georgia for the summer. His rate is unbeatable, and I basically get to apprentice him for a summer, solidifying my teaching and performing technique.  So I drive 8 hours from my house at school to his place in rural Georgia. This place is \~rural\~, like biggest town is 35 minutes away, and it's a town of a few thousand people. So I'm physically isolated, but he's always wanted to be like the cool uncle, so he lets me bring guys over. Things are fine until my best friend whom I talked to every night undertook an internship that prevented us from spending time together each night. Tom tries to use this opportunity to move our relationship further. He convinces me that in order to be his friend I have to let him become physical--which is complicated because of the physical nature of our craft. There are very legitimate pedagogical functions of which one needs to have an awareness below the belt. But this wasn't that. I want to be crystal clear: his pedagogy was pure; this has nothing to do with what he taught me about the very legitimate functions of the body related to my craft. He tells me his a licensed massage therapist, and that he can help me relieve the tension in my body by letting him massage me. Whatever, I've always known him as a safe place, so what's the harm in letting him give me a massage. He begins encouraging me to take my clothes completely off. I eventually relent, and let him massage me naked. The thing is, after the clothes came off, he kept aiming for my erogenous zones. He'd spend lots of time around my nipples and groin that caused me to get a boner. He then becomes obsessed with touching me. He demands we cuddle and sleep together in the same bed. 

I didn't allow him to just take advantage of me without pushback. I was like stop this a boundary that you're crossing, but he (as he later relished in when I became directly confrontational) is a master manipulator, and he convinced me that everything was alright, and that I was just exploring new levels of vulnerability, and eventually this would just strengthen our friendship. 

Fine. Eventually he convinces me that the tension is centered around my rectum, and that in order to relieve the tension that was hampering my musical success, he'd have to relieve the tension in my lowerbody by milking my prostrate. Obviously, I'm like fuck no dude. At this point though, I've already ceded too much ground to Tom, though. He continues to give me massages. One night he says lets drink and do benzos. (Remember I'm a drug addict, so like hell yea bro). Unbeknownst to me, he also gives me a Viagra. That night he eventually convinces me to let him digitally enter my rectum but that he just wasn't allowed to like finger blast my prostate. Despite that, he keeps pressing my prostate, and I'm rockhard because I've had a Viagra. He takes that as a sign and says he knows just the thing to end the night. He brings out a fleshlight. At this I'm like bro what the fuck, and he and I get in a huge fight. 

I tell him that he is systematically ignoring my boundaries, but he tells me that he's really just trying to let me be vulnerable. Keep in mind this man knows that I have been stalked, assaulted, and raped twice. He knows I'm bipolar, and he knows that I have a drug dependency problem. On top of that, he claims to understand the aftermath of sexual battery, so I relent that maybe he knows best. He is like a bona fide adult, so I figure he knows more than I do about how to heal from sexual trauma. I don't immediately leave, but I'm between a rock and a hard place because I can't tell anyone about the boundaries Tom is crossing because of his reputation. If I leave early, too many people will ask why, and what am I supposed to tell them? He didn't ""do"" anything; he just made me uncomfortable. He is my friend after all. I don't want to send him back to jail or make him a social pariah.

At the same time though, the man he was most interested in basically told him that there was no future for their relationship. This broke Tom; he began threatening me with his suicide if I didn't help him through this--which meant cuddling him as he cried over this man. 

Thus what little ground I have won back by putting a stop to all the physicality, is now ceded once more because I don't want him to kill himself. 

Things reach a fever pitch the last night I'm there when he asks us to cuddle for the last time. Here, he breaks down all of the boundaries and eventually gives me a blow job and fingers my prostate. 

The thing is, none of that felt like I had a choice. There would have been social and career consequences to my leaving, and he isolated me. He told me about a month in that he was too possessive of me to let me have sex with other guys, so he'd appreciate if I stopped bringing guys around. His situation made it so that I couldn't reach out to my family or friends, because what would they say: the convicted sex offender that you lived with for two months coerced you into sex 😱😱 WHO could have seen this coming?

The final nail in the coffin is that he told me that he had sex with another student he had since their childhood shortly after they turned 18 (mind you, this was AFTER the sex conviction, so I can't tell if it's a legalistic change in MO to avoid an abuse charge). I don't really know what to do. I feel personally wronged, but I don't know if I was wronged from a legal stand point. Further adding to this is that he was awarded an undisclosed multi-million dollar plea deal from the state in which I grew up, and like this isn't my motivation, but my suing him would not affect his livelihood as he something like a 10-digit sum coming his way. Is there any ground here for civil liabilities? I like am genuinely afraid that he'll just do this again with the next student who's unlucky enough to have him, and this has severely affected my ability to perform in school and continuing on with my career. Like am I better off writing him out of my life, and closing the book on this long chapter of abusive behavior, or is this worth litigating?"

mf99xy,2,2021-03-28,Inferiority Complex Due on Frontend?,OriginalRare,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mf99xy/inferiority_complex_due_on_frontend/,"Hey guys, little about me:

I’m a junior iOS Engineer at a mid tier fintech company. I learned Swift as an intern at the same place. This is my first FT position and I feel like I might have somewhat of an inferiority complex.

My undergrad classwork was almost entirely C++ and most of my friends are doing backend, lower-level type work at their jobs. I didn’t really intend to end up in iOS, but I find it very fun and my team is fantastic 🤷‍♂️

This might be stupid, but does anyone working on front end ever feel... slightly inferior to those doing backend work? 

For example, sometimes I feel like the output of my job matters less than those of my friends at FAANG’s. I am a junior dev, so of course I don’t know most things. Still, most of my job seems to be hitting APIs, deserializing data from them, and binding them to the UI. There hasn’t been a huge need to implement any technical algorithms or think heavily about a grand overarching strategy for the whole app. I don’t feel like I need to be a visionary mastermind as long as I can read a jira ticket and use MVVM.

Clearly it’s difficult to do all this with simple, efficient, testable, and extensible code, but it’s definitely the type of thing where I feel like the skill floor is not too high. I was basically able to join the company and immediately start on core feature work. I made mistakes, I’m still making mistakes, but I also don’t feel completely outclassed by the principals / seniors.

But then I look at some blog posts written by these superstar backend engineers and it’s like.. damn, these guys and girls are just operating on a different level. 

I have gotten quite interested in programming languages / compilers and read a lot on the Swift forums. While doing so, I have been really impressed by its contributors. For example, Chris Lattner created LLVM as a result of what was originally going to be a no thesis masters! He and Bertrand Serlet seemed to almost casually just create the Swift language out of discussions they had about making Objective-C better. More recently I found that one of the main people pushing for C++ / Swift interop is a high school senior who ~also~ has multiple contributions to libc++ and Clang. When I was a senior, I was trying to get to Plat in LoL 🙃

As I write this, it’s clear that I’m still grappling with some impostor syndrome. With that said, it still feels to me that backend languages like C++ just give you far more control than something like Swift, which in turn lets you build more complex software. I hate doing Leetcode with Swift just because C++ is far more precise.

It’s hard for me to escape the feeling that I’m just a code monkey tinkering around with his sticks while the guys next door are figuring out how to engineer a bridge.

Edit: Just realized I messed up the title, should have been “frontend inferiority complex”"

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told (and I know) that in some circumstances I can get too friendly with the people I meet: I am really open to meeting new people and opening up to them, and I have been told that it may come a little... creepy?

For example, I am in love with the region I live in, and I love showing it to new people. I work in academia, and thus we get a lot of foreign people in internships or short-term visits, and I try to be really welcoming. There's nothing I'd enjoy more than jumping in my car, and taking them to the beautiful cliffs, forests (even more now in spring), etc. That's all good and dandy, but... yeah, I get really self-conscious.

I'm a nerdy guy that has a tendency to make awkward remarks, and I admit I'm kinda weird sometimes. I get especially self-conscious when talking to girls; I don't want them to confuse my friendliness and want to be welcoming with flirting and weird them out, and this fear/shyness inhibits me very frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, something that happened this week. We have a new intern in our research group that has finally come after a tedious process regarding paperwork and Covid permits. She and I have talked multiple times regarding work issues and how she's enjoying her first weeks here. This weekend some friends and I (we all work at the same institution, but on different shifts, so we don't really see each other at work) were going to go light hiking, and I thought it'd be nice to ask the new intern to come with us and socialize a bit.

I remember that during my internship abroad I was very shy and isolated, and I believe that I'd be reeeeally thankful if someone came to me and invited me to their plans, especially in the beginning. But, as I left for home on Friday she was busy with work and I suddenly got too shy and simply walked away. When I told my friends they laughed and teased me because as the only single friend left there's this joke about how I am always ""looking for possibilities"", but they agreed that I should've told her.

But that's the problem. I don't want to seem I'm trying to flirt with her or ""that I see her as a candidate for romance"" (sigh, I guess it's tongue in cheek, but still), I just want to be friendly to someone that possibly is feeling kinda lonely right now. It makes me self conscious that it may come out that way, and that I end up making people uncomfortable or believe I'm a weirdo.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, that was a long, and I don't know if that was a question looking for advice, or a rant, but well, I would be really thankful if you could give me a piece of advice or insights on the situation. Has it happened to you previously? How did you deal with the bad feeling that came with (at least for me) good intention?"

I am looking to get into a computer science degree however when I look at the salaries, I don't what to expect because on indeed and glassdoor and other websites it gives different and odd salaries.

1. Could anyone list out some reasonable salaries or what they started off with for someone who has completed a bachelors degree and maybe 1-2 internships?
2. The salary for someone who has completed a masters degree?

It doesn't have to be an exact salary but I want a general idea :)

Also before anyone says I shouldn't do a career if I am doing it for the salary, I am actually interested in this field but I want a job that I'll be able to also make a reasonable amount of money with as well."

I tried so hard in school (around 3.8 GPA) , applied to so many internships, and got so close in the interview process but never landed any. I was so close to graduating but starting feeling like shit. Ultimately I began to question what's going to happen when I graduate, whether I even want to be an engineer, do I want to even finish my degree, have I wasted the last couple years?

Getting a good, quality education was one of the main reasons I decided to get my masters so that i could foster my skills and feel competent in policy/politics.

mfbpay,0,2021-03-28,"Help to decide between CS engeneering, consulting and financial market?",SanderSohngen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mfbpay/help_to_decide_between_cs_engeneering_consulting/,"TL;DR: how do you think the carreer for a comp. engineer compares to consulting and financial market? Way less working hours? Much less stressful? Does the difference in salary make up for it? Would you chose something different now that you know how the CS market is? How is the work environment? What carrer options do I have with a computer engineering degree?  


Last year I got into a top university in Brazil, but because of the 'prestige' of it, many engeneering students choose going to IB or consulting as they pay much better and there are many study groups here  focused in financial and consulting competitions, which usually lands them internship at McKinsey, Bank of America and such.

  
I decided to give computer engineering a shot, because I often hear how there's always going to be market for it and it seemed the only kind of engeneering I'd actually like, which was completly true up until the second semester, in which we learned more low level stuff (multiplex, flip-flops, registers, counters...) and it was kind of meh. Anyway, we were learning C, so I decided to learn Python and JS on my own, got to watch a few videos about it and videos as 'a day in the life of X' or 'why code interviews are broken' started to pop up. After watching a few of those, it didn't seem much better than what my friends told me about those other options, even if the workload is way lower (in some of these study groups, they spend 40-60h per week preparing for competitions and study just enough to get approved on our uni courses) because the stess of it seems to be kind of the same (clients saying they want X, when they want Y; project manager and deadlines being unreasonable) but the pay is way less.  


In a few weeks, the selective process for those groups will be starting, which made me start thinking whether it would be a good idea to switch focus or if I could use something from programming as an advantage. I already know consulting and financial market are very stressful and long working hours, but if dev. is kind of like lite consulting, isn't the switch worth it? It would help me a lot if you guys could share your experience for me to have a better idea of how the job really is"

Via Quora (Finn Hulse) 

Original question: What are good reasons to attend Dartmouth rather than a ""top tier"" Ivy such as Harvard, Yale, or Princeton?

Cradling a newborn Finn in her arms, my mother joked to my dad,

“He can be anything he wants as long as he goes to Dartmouth and becomes a doctor.”

There was a reason she jokingly picked Dartmouth for me. My mother grew up in the Hanover area and has known many, many Dartmouth grads in her life. She knows the way a Dartmouth grad’s eyes twinkle with easygoing happiness and keen intelligence. She’s seen the way Dartmouth alums unfailingly drop everything to help other alums. She understands the magic of “Dartmouth.” There was a genuine sense of hope in what she said to my father.

17 years after my mom cracked that joke, I expressed a keen interest in Harvard College to my parents. It was the best, right? I’ve always been the type to aim for the top.

The look my parents gave me was one I’ll never forget. They turned their heads toward me with utterly blank faces. My mom cocked her head like she knew something I didn’t. Like she felt bad for me.

“Harvard? Why?”

You see, my parents met as grad students at the one and only Harvard University. Between the two of them, they have one PhD, one master’s and one law degree from said institution. They know Harvard very, very well. (They also went to run-of-the-mill colleges for undergrad and had a dandy time, so they weren’t inclined to push me much at all in high school, actually.)

To them, it didn’t make sense to go to a place like the Big H with all of its outstanding resources, just to enroll in their College. It would be like a toddler going to the world’s finest jewelry store just to plop down and make Play-Doh jewelry in the back room. Why not just find a great pre-K and play with Play-Doh there?

It would be silly to say that Harvard is not an excellent place to attend college. You’ll be able to see graduate students doing awesome research. You’ll be able to hear graduate students deliver some great lectures (while the professor attends to more important matters). You’ll be able to talk to those world-class professors in between the time they spend doing serious work with graduate students. When it’s all over, you can probably get a great job making $90k a year. If that number sounds low to you, you can apply to graduate school. Good luck getting into somewhere like Harvard for grad school if you’re not at the top of your class. Good luck being at the top of your class at Harvard, Princeton or Yale if you want to have a fun time.

What if you didn’t have to deal with graduate students at all? What if you could interact with world-class professors freely, even taking them to lunch for free? What if you didn’t have to step over hordes of ridiculously-competitive peers trying to grab up every internship, research position, job and graduate-school acceptance? (Imagine even being able to excel relative to your peers!) What if you could have fun in college? What if you could be at a place that made you a better person? How about a community with bonds of unparalleled strength stretching across multiple generations?! It sounds like a very good deal. That is a taste of what Dartmouth has to offer.

Location is often pointed to as Dartmouth’s big weakness. I’m slightly biased since I spend a lot of time visiting family in the area, but I would rank Hanover (as a college town) way above any fancy city. I grew up in Cambridge, and I think it’s very nice. Boston is generally fabulous. New Haven is ugly but has some incredible pizza. Princeton, New Jersey is homey, but you’ll have to grapple with the existential crisis that comes with inhabiting New Jersey. You won’t be able to escape the mind-numbing cold no matter which “top-tier” Ivy you choose. You won’t be able to enjoy it, either, unless your college happens to own a skiing mountain and countless acres of gorgeous, rolling, natural land.

This response barely scratches the surface of Dartmouth’s true strength. There are tons of great reasons to attend ranging from its quarter system to Morano Gelato being across the street (Forbes calls it the best gelato in America, and I wholeheartedly agree). All things considered, there is a reason my mom wanted me to be a Dartmouth man instead of just another snobby HYP alum.

mfen4t,1,2021-03-28,Should I go to Georgia Tech or Johns Hopkins for computer engineering?,ltrxn,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/mfen4t/should_i_go_to_georgia_tech_or_johns_hopkins_for/,"I'm a high school senior who is extremely conflicted on where to go after reading and hearing about people's experiences at both universities. 

According to US News undergraduate rankings, Georgia Tech is #5 in computer engineering, but Hopkins is #9 in National Universities. I love GT's collaborative culture, strong career focus (better career center and fairs), and name recognition in the industry. I've reached out to many incoming students, and I really enjoyed talking to them. However, Hopkins stands out to me with its incredibly driven student body, more expansive course offerings (well-rounded), and close-knit community. Although Hopkins isn't as well known as GT for their ECE and CS programs, many of their students do land great jobs- maybe even at a higher rate. 

Personally, I'm looking for the college where I will learn and grow the most as a person, have the best career outlook (it would be cool to intern at a top tech company), have more opportunities, and make unforgettable memories with awesome people. I'm not considering finances and things like location and weather.

I know I can't go wrong with any of these options, but this decision will impact my next four years, so I'm thinking a lot about it. I'd love to hear your opinions and experiences! It'll help me a ton.

tldr: Is GT or JHU a better fit if I'm looking for self-growth and a higher chance of being recruited to a major tech company?"

I mean yes, tuition is much much lower and you will save money. The only problem is CS is getting more and more competitive by the day, I've been researching the transfer acceptance rates and it is much lower than a Highschool grad. (Research done based around UC or University of California, and Cal State Universities). Not to mention, it is significantly harder to achieve work experience aka internships without pursuing a four year unless you have connections. 

Obviously there are ways to stand out from the crowd and improve your chances of getting in, but even so that is a feat in itself and not everyone can do. In the end, someone could be just left doing two years of CC but don't get accepted to any University for CS because of its competitive nature.

This is in the context of someone wanting to transfer to a university that maybe has better resources and opportunities."

When I was an intern in a companies IT department, I was tasked with setting up a new printer for one of the divisional offices, a very simple and easy task. The printer was even already at the office so I didn't have to lug it around town. When I got to the office I started setting unpacking the printer and put it where the office people wanted it, on top of a 4 foot filing cabinet. When I get it up there I start plugging it in. The power first then the network cable. After I turn on the printer, I'm asked to move it over just a little more. While doing this, my fat fingers accidentally press some buttons.... With only a couple button presses I managed to unknowingly set the printers language to Russian. I don't speak Russian.

As an IT guy, I figure I can fix this pretty easily. I try (and fail) to find the language menu again. Then I try all the usual way to factory reset a machine. Then I try researching how to factory reset the printer. I then try reaching out to my coworkers. No cigar. 

Finally I have to call tech support for the printer. After being on hold for luckily not very long, maybe 15 minutes. I explain my situation and ask how to factory reset the printer. There is no way to do this. The man puts me on hold as he heads to the printer in their test lab. He ended up having to walk me through getting to the language menu from the main menu, and it was just him telling me to press different buttons different amounts of times. Finally the printer was set back to English and I could finish the Job.

So this post is proof that sometimes even tech support needs to call tech support."

I am currently in the OSU Computer Science Bachelor Program and I am probably going to be pursuing my first internship for summer of 2022 (that is next summer). I still have a little more than a year, but I wanted to page the group on how I could prepare.

1) Should I look for internships that require travel (in other states/cities) or should I focus locally? I live in Portland, OR so there is no shortage of opportunity if I decide to stay local.

2) Any tips on how to prepare (other than completing my courses with good grades)?

3) What kind of companies should I look at? This will be my first internships, so FAANG groups seem like they will probably be a bit difficult...

4) When should I start applying?

8/10 - English teacher. She used a lot of anecdotes and described my presence in her class well.

7.5/10 - History teacher. He called me one of the best students he has ever taught, but I don't know if he used the best examples or had the best details.

9/10 - a lawyer that I've worked with. She highlighted my humour and likeable personality in addition to my strong leadership skills - a fine balance.

8.5/10 - Counsellor - she compared me to a 'shining star' (adorable metaphor) but I never got to read this one, so again, not too sure if the examples were concrete or if the details were the best

**Interviews**

* Harvard (REA): 8/10. We talked a lot about politics mixing with COVID and seemed to have a lot in common. She was really sweet and nice.
* Princeton: 8.5/10. We had a lot in common, I carried the convo for a majority of it but really emphasized my excitement for a program specific only to Princeton, which he caught onto.
* Didn't get interview requests for Columbia or Yale (should I be concerned?)

**Essays**

CommonApp: 8/10. Looking back, there are certainly improvements that I would have made, but I think the different layers of my personality are made clear. I didn't link it explicitly to my dream career or intended major, but I think it alludes to it.

Supplements: 8/10. There are certainly some essays that were stronger (ex. Yale) and some weaker (Columbia), but overall I'm proud of them and I think they highlight my multidimensional interests well.

University of Maryland ( I know it’s great university for engineering and I am considering umd too but I love California more)
UT Dallas 
Also I got waitlisted at  University Of Michigan, UIUC,UCSD , Purdue university and university of Washington Seattle ( I will go to one of this university is I get in ) 

As you all are very experienced and I am just entering the field of engineering, I don’t want to make any mistake in choosing the first step so can you all guide me that these universities will be the best option for engineering.( in terms of job opportunities, careers, salaries, professors, internships, and hands on experiences etc) As I am living internationally (though I am Citizen of USA ) I don’t want to make a mistake choosing my first step so can u all guide me."

Coming from a small coastal town, I hated NY- got a 2.5 GPA my freshman year first semester and pass/failed the majority of my courses second semester.

COVID hit, couldn't land a single internship. Returned to NY, joined ROTC briefly for a career change only to be medically DQ'ed this past fall. Back to looking into a business career and got decent grades last semester (3.7).

I managed to join a good consulting club and get a fintech start-up internship for this spring by leveraging my chronic gaming/PC addiction and a few connections. However, my peers and a mentor frontloaded me with a crash course on finance, and after a couple months of research, high-end finance is somewhere I'd like to end up (IB as of now but keeping my options open).

What should be my next steps as of right now? I'm trying to coffee chat as many people as possible (high execs, current analysts, and upperclassmen), but I feel way behind the curve having no finance experience.

I'm so torn as articles will say I need a PE/HF/IB/Diversity internship for sophomore to junior summer, while others claim I just need relevant finance experience.

I've established a decent relationship with a HF PM who has taken me under his wing by giving me resources to study, but I'm assuming that's a litmus test for him to see if I'm truly interested so haven't asked for anything else.

Should I be reaching out to boutiques to get possible work for this summer, or is it too late being almost April?

I also saw on a few forums that working at a local well-known bank's retail brokerage filing papers, running coffee etc. could be a good look on my resume.

Would this be a good way to get future positions or am I just wasting my time?

A lot of information, so I'm going to end it here in hopes I outlined the situation properly. Thanks in advance."

By that I mean smth like a second job, freelance, specialize in some kind of projects, etc. 

I have already read about this topic and I saw that a lot of engineers do ""freelance consulting"". But since I'm young and unexperienced I don't think I can do it :/

Also, I'm not really convinced about being freelance because there will always be an asian or an indian doing the same for half your price (I'm not racist, but the cost of living there is different). But idk since I haven't tried it either.. 

Another thing I thought about is web/software development. I kinda like to code and I'm good at things related to computers. Do you think that can lead to a good second source of income?

How good/helpful is the careers department in helping you get internships and would you say being in cali is a massive advantage for finding internships and jobs in tech? 

Are the reputations of either school significant when applying for jobs and if so which school has the better rep?

How good and affordable is the food in the area and also what’s the quality and variety of food in the dining halls like?

What is public transportation like? If staying off campus would I need a car to get around?

I’m also working a great industry internship at the moment too. 

The talk of going full time has started to come up which is exciting. The full-time equivalent of the job would be continuing build upon the foundation I am currently building in my internship. It would be a cool job too, but I could only see myself doing this for the short term. I’d take this job to force my shitty advisors hand to push myself out and graduate from this degree program. 

However, one of my industry contacts and I had a chat about career paths. He mentioned if I wanted to get more into spin physics and quantum computing side of the industry instead of the materials/ tooling side, that he had a contact at MIT that he’d be more than willing to reach out too.

From my understanding, Post Doc experiences are quite short at no more than a year or two (tops 3). After that ends, I’d have to look for a job which is a pain. The industry job I might have an offer for, I couldn’t see myself doing more than 3 years either. However, the location and pay would be killer and it would get my foot in the door somewhere. This would come at the expense that I likely couldn’t advance to what I would want to do industry. 

What do I do? If I only had one choice, this would be a little of a no brainer for me, but I’m not sure what would be best in the long term."

But I've also seen some people get as low as like $20/hr.

I'm interviewing for a mid-sized DC DoD contractor, the job posting was very vague on the duties, and was directed at general interns saying they have spots in business/marketing/IT. It's not until today I interview with the man below the CIO where I figure out my actual job duties/ask about pay/etc.

I'm currently an IT major with a cybersecurity concentration, only about ~13 credits away from graduation. Also have an active clearance w/relevant military IT experience. But I'm at a loss for how to even approach wage negotiation for an internship, and if there is no negotiation, how I can find out what a reasonable pay is so I can just walk if it's a lowball.

Also if anyone has any extra pointers on what would come up in a vague IT intern interview? Only thing I know is there will be some coding, when I asked the HR rep what language, she said she didn't know. I'm pretty good with Python, took two semesters in it, did very well. I am a bit rusty since it's been a couple years since I had those courses. Done PHP + HTML too but those aren't really programming.

Thanks all"

However, I've already accepted a Co-Op in the utilities industry, so it makes my decision making a bit more complicated.  I was hoping for some perspective on any of the following 3 scenarios.

I could just decline the internship offer, and stick with my 3 rotation co-op.  I don't think that this is a terrible option since I'm also interested in energy, and co-ops seem to lead to more full time placements afterwards.

I could take the internship offer, but end up working 3 semesters in a row (1 co-op, 1 internship, 1 co-op).  This way I could still honor my co-op and get more experience in a different field.  The disadvantage is that I would be out of school for 3 full semesters (Spring, Summer, Fall).

I could take the internship offer, and leave my co-op after 1 rotation.  This would probably burn bridges with the co-op people, but would allow me to get more experience elsewhere and still have a normal college schedule.

Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated!"

I'm an electrical engineering student and I applied for a junior frontend (and potentially full-stack) developer job. I did a lot of online coding tests and theoretical tests for the company already, and I'll have a videocall interview tomorrow.

The CTO whom I talked to said that he will be testing my algorithmic skills in about 45 minutes. I can't really imagine how will this go, I didn't really study or practice for it a lot, because I've been pretty busy with university stuff lately. At least I'm not really worried if I won't get accepted, because I don't really need the money, and I'm a pretty beginner at frontend stuff. I only applied because it would look cool on my CV and there are also some other jobs, mainly intern positions that would suit my studies a bit more.

Nevertheless, I'd like to ask how would you study/practice for these kind of interviews? I'm asking because I see myself applying to other programming related jobs in the future.

Otherwise, I'd be trying to fix it and posting to r/relationship_advice. 

I have been dating this girl for almost six months. I knew she had bipolar disorder at the beginning of the relationship, but I really liked her and decided to see how it goes. For the first half of the relationship, things were good, but these last three months have been awful. She has lost all control of her manic moods. She routinely has episodes of intense crying, screaming, and throwing objects around the house. It has gotten to a point where it happens three out of every four days. Luckily, her rage isn't always centered at me. Usually it's her depression centered around constant job, internship, and master's applications getting rejected. She takes this so personally and no advice I can give, nor coddling, nor support can stop her negativity. Every day there is a new stress or drama from her that affects me, my sleep, my relationships with others, and my job. I am in no way physically, mentally or emotionally able to handle her manic episodes.

She refuses to get help because of some bad experiences with previous therapists. She has an addictive personality and constantly chases highs, whether it's drugs or food. She never wants to deal with any of her emotions and assures me all she has to do is suppress everything and things will be ok. I know a bad situation when I see one, and I need to get out.

Here is my question. She is so entrenched in my life. She is helping me build a new business, she is part of my flag football league, she knows so many people I know. How do I end a relationship with someone who is so emotionally unstable and yet so entrenched in my life? Also, I have made so many promises to her (like we'll live together etc). I know I'll break her heart. I don't think I can diminish that effect. I'll ruin her future perceptions of men and relationships. But... I dunno.

Also, I still have feelings for her, so I still have the usual ""it's gonna hurt to know she is fucking other dudes"" kind of mentality. How do I get over that? Even after all these years, this childish mentality still sticks with me. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and I look forward to your responses."

After college, I got into a nice in-house IT job for an small a company (about 300- 500 people). I really love my IT team and the people in the company. I went from an Intern, to a Service desk admin 1, then Service Desk admin 2. After 4 years of working at the place, I start to suffer from ""the grass is greener on the other side"" mentality. I felt like it was time for me to find another job. I felt like thing were getting boring.

I start applying for jobs. After going throw a couple of ""talk to the manager, talk to the team, talk to the VP of IT, just so we can then tell you No"". I apply for a job on Thursday, I got into an interview that was ""fishy"" from the beginning.

* On a Friday of the same week, the recruiter calls me and ask me some basic IT questions. Nothing really difficult. After that, they set an interview with a manager from an MSP for the following Monday.
* The interview with the manager was also ""Basic"". He ask some some basic questions, nothing crazy and I was able to answer them.
* Literally 5 minutes after I finish the interview, the recruiter calls me and tell me that they want to hire me. They already had a offer letter on hand. They told me that I had a couple of hours to sign the offer.
* this is were I start to rise my eyebrow. That was my first and only interview with the company, and 5 minutes after the interviewer, they already want to give me the job.
* They also wanted me ( almost pushing) to start new week. I told them that I need to give at least a two week notice.

I know I should have say no to the job, but after applying to so many job and gone throw the process to interviews, this was the first one who say yes.

I start to notice the problems from day one at the new job.

* it's an MSP. most people here know whats app with most MSPs. The good things about MSPs is that you get to work in a lot of different environment and learn new things. the bad things are literally everything else (Like billing). This one has all the bad thing without any of the good things.
* They have me working in a small (50 people) in-house office just doing the basic things (I;m the only IT in the office).
* According to the other employees, this is a revolving door for IT guys. all of them leave in less than a year.
* This is a dead-end job. The MSP just want someone physically in the office to maintain hardware, fix monitor, printers, and set desks for new hires. It is a big big, and I mean big company so anything outside of those types of basic IT issue, they already have people/processes to take care of that.

I feel like I went back to step 1 on my carrier. In my last company, I was working on Powershell scripting and automation for the entire company and things like that. Now I'm back to disconnect and reconnect a DVI cable to ""fix"" a monitor display. This was the first time looking for a job ( I started in my last company as an intern) and part of it is my fault for not asking better, but I'm freaking out. I don't know what to do. I only have 3 months in this company. Should I start to apply for more jobs.

Here is the fifty-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

mfsx4s,4,2021-03-29,How to land your dream job (Clickbait),oldmansamuelson,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mfsx4s/how_to_land_your_dream_job_clickbait/,"After being on this forum for a while now, I have seen a pattern where someone posts about how to get a job at a top firm in a top role and they're in their junior/senior year. It can be intimidating looking at those roles as a freshman/sophomore/high school student but a lot of y'all have the aptitude to get the job, but you shoot yourself in the foot. Here are a few things I have found:

1. **Success snowballs**: As a freshman/sophomore your main goals should be adjusting to college and getting good grades (plus having fun). But if you can, try to do something above and beyond. That could be a leadership position on campus, research with a prof, or an unpaid internship. I did 2 unpaid internships which led to my paid sophomore internship which lead to my paid junior internship which led to my current, full-time job.  My first unpaid internship was bs and I did not really learn much, but it was one of my most important experiences in terms of progression.
2. **Think about what you want and do the research:** Way too many people start thinking about a career their junior or senior year, at that point the people who are competing for that role have already passed you. You don't need to know exactly what you want to do but research and network to see what types of jobs you want to look for. I've seen so many "" I want to work in IB either buyside or sellside"" or ""I want to be an analyst"" coming from seniors in college. There are a lot of resources online, knowing what you are talking about during a networking call or interview is always preferable. There are no such thing as dumb questions but ask them early on expectations are low.  When someone is networking with me, I hold a junior and freshman do different standards. 
3. **You don't need to be perfect:** No applicant is perfect or even close to it. Your goal is to be really good at a few things that matter for that type of role. Want to work in IB, being personable and having financial knowledge is useful. Want to be a quant? Programing and math would be needed. Most candidates tend to underestimate the value that they bring. You all have value, don't forget that even when you keep getting rejected. But, adjust your standards based on your qualifications."

mft6vs,353,2021-03-29,"It's simple - if you don't hear back within a week after the superday, you probably didn't get the offer",fleetmacbb,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/mft6vs/its_simple_if_you_dont_hear_back_within_a_week/,"This will be blunt, but I have had so many people ask me about this and I wanted to share my experience and what I think is the truth. As someone who has gone through the recruitment process (for internships) and interviewed with MANY companies, including big banks, the big 4, etc, if they really like you and want you to work for them, they get back to you fairly quick. I heard back the day after my superday for two of the companies I interviewed with (one of them being a Big 4). I wanted to see if this was true for my other friends, and it appears to be the way it goes. My close friend interviewed with one of the bulge brackets and heard back 5 days later. That is the max I have heard so far. If you are waiting longer than 7-8 days, I would say your chances are very slim or they have you on a waitlist because you weren't their top choice. 

If a week goes by and you still don't hear anything, email HR and they will get back to you. I know a lot of people include other offers they got in the email so it kind of forces them to get back to you ASAP."

My parents want me to find a job but my incompetent ass can't get one even if I try. (In our country we keep living with our parents till we are married lol)

Trying to make some friends, but getting backstabbed by literally everyone. I broke up with this girl I thought I was my best friend just a week ago, cause she spread false rumours about me in the entire college.

Thought that having a boyfriend would pull me out of this mess. But I'm making his life worse. He used to be happier when I wasn't in his life.

Now that I think about it, everyone was happy when I wasn't in the picture. I guess whoever is reading this post, If I enter your life I'll make you sad too.

My mom is against this decision of mine, as I don't have a job and she can't offer me financial support as she used to. I'm 3 courses away from graduation and have some money saved up plus some other money I'll get from an internship I finished recently. I think that's enough till summer time, when I'll start looking for a job. I might also consider looking for a part time job right now, but the whole pandemic/lockdown thing makes me pessimistic.

Another downside is that my country has mandatory military military service for 12 months, which I haven't completed yet but I still have time.

Thing is I'm super depressed in my mom's house, and everytime I come here for vacation time I feel like leaving the very next day. 

On the plus side, my GF owns her apartment, so she's we won't be paying any rent which is a big money saver. Also, not being in a depressing state full of anxiety is a plus in my book.

I know this is a risk, but I think it's a risk I want and need to take. I know it's going to be hard at first but I don't mind struggling.

I guess I'm looking for some words of encouragement because I'm super anxious about it."

I’ve been struggling with choosing between two PhD programs I’ve gotten offers from: Northwestern MechE (anticipated concentration in robotics and controls) and Michigan Robotics.

I know that I want to do work in prosthetics/assistive devices/rehabilitation, but would also like more of a hands-on experience with research, too. I really like Michigan’s curriculum and the research seems cool, and I’m pretty excited about the research at Northwestern as well. Speaking with professors and students at both institutions have been helpful, and I know that I’d be interested to work with faculty at either school. I think I’m just at a loss with which school would be best for leading to an industry career in this area post PhD and connections for related internships down the line. 

I’ve also just felt all the more confused on which one to choose and just insecure in general due to recent family opinions about robotics being an less stable choice or a program that would lead to struggle with finding a job after grad school (which I don’t think is true, but has been adding to my stress with this choice nonetheless).

A. Team A where the work is based on improving their cloud platform features, it focuses a lot on architecture and not so much coding per se. This team is a new one and my mentor will be an architect.
He is a bit abstract and a very smart and nice guy.

B. Team B developing a service the integrates with their product where a very good friend of mine works, consists of like 5 people full stack .Net + Angular.

mfwdmt,3,2021-03-29,How did you better understand which job/career suits you best?,ViewtifulBlob,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mfwdmt/how_did_you_better_understand_which_jobcareer/,"Hey all,

I'd like some thoughts on where I'm currently at and what may be some good ideas for future career aspirations. I graduated from College late 2019 with a focus on Information Technology. While I was in college, I had a hard time keeping an interest in the field and never found myself to be too techy. while in College, I had a few internships related both to tech and marketing but never really found myself wanting to dive deeper into those fields. I told myself once I graduated college I'd surely gain more interest in what I do.

About a year and a half later and I am in the same sort of state in regards to interests. I'm thankfully employed at the moment and working remote in an IT related role which I am grateful for, but I have not really looked forward to the day to day arbitrary work that comes with office work.

To better understand what gets me going, I worked a few weekends doing handyman work (painting houses, deconstruction). While it was nice seeing the fruits of my labor, I understand that sort of work definitely takes a toll on the body. Below are some stuff I've discovered that I like/dislike in a job over the past few months:

&amp;#x200B;

**What I noticed I like in a job**

* Helping and Informing people
* A job where I know what to do, and I can listen to music and do the work
* Where I have a start and end to my tasks that I can focus on without having to deal with never ending projects
* Tangible results
* Working on my own
* Once the day is over, it's over (Not a fan of emails out of normal office hours)

**What I noticed I don't like in a job**

* A rigid 9-5 schedule
* Not having a team for support
* Sitting down for an entire shift
* Overly complicated processes and procedures
* A hovering manager/boss
* Not having a tangible goal
* Sales or sales quota related work

&amp;#x200B;

I understand some of the above contradicts itself (Like working on my own yet liking the idea of helping and informing people) but that's what I've noticed interests me over the past year. Currently, I'm considering either substitute teaching within a High School or signing up for a Tradesman Apprenticeship. I'm also keeping an open mind to anything that I find interesting over the next few months and trying to look out of the box.

I do get that no job will be perfect, and there are things that you'll just have to deal with. That said, I'd to have a job or career that I can feel satisfied/happy with 70% of the time, and the other 30% would be things that I don't mind dealing with. There's also the idea that it may not be the job that's the issue, but my viewpoint on it.

So to sum it up I'm asking two questions from this post:

1. How did you better or best understand which job/career fits your interests?
2. What advice would you give someone like me based on the info above?"
mfwdo4,15,2021-03-29,The Banyan Skulker,AnonSubmission,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mfwdo4/the_banyan_skulker/,"I live in a relatively well-off, suburban area. To be precise, I lived in that specific area at the outer city limits, where the towering buildings and apartments of the city transition smoothly into the walled villas and houses of suburbia.

The place consists mostly of houses, yards, and gardens. And in those gardens and yards, and along the roads and streets, you would find fig trees.

Now, I don’t mean the common edible fig. I mean the big, ornamental ficus trees, the ones that are usually sold as houseplants but are in fact huge trees. Here in the humid tropics, the various ficus trees flourished, and grew wild and vast.

Most of the ficus trees in our neighborhood were huge banyans and stranglers. A strangler fig would start off as a tiny seed, deposited by a bird perhaps, sprouting high up in the canopy of a host tree. As the young fig grows, it sends down roots until it makes contact with the ground. Fueled by this new connection to the earth, they send down more roots until the host is enveloped in a mesh of woody roots. These roots eventually fuse together into a trunk, restricting the growth of the host tree. Eventually, the host dies and rots away, and only the fig is left, with a hollow trunk of prop roots. 

Many tropical figs that start off as stranglers later become banyans. Banyans would send down thin, wiry aerial roots from their branches, and once they reach the soil these would increase in girth until they resembled secondary trunks, propping up the tree. In this way a banyan expands and grows ever more massive.

A truly huge banyan, with its plethora of prop roots, resembles a forest in miniature. Such massive specimens truly have a certain grandeur about them, a sort of primordial grandiosity. No wonder then, that banyans feature prominently in several cultures.

In the Philippines, where banyans are known as balete, they are said to be the home of various spirits. When I was little, we had a Filipino housekeeper, who use to tell us stories of the strange entities that resided in a banyan, a whole plethora of supernatural beings just as varied as Japanese youkai or European fey. 

Anyway, our climate was ideal for strangler figs, and you could find some growing not only on trees, but also eaves, drainpipes, walls, overpasses and even roofs. Any neglected corner of a suitable building could play host to a strangler fig or two.

So many different species from different regions meant that you could always find a species or two fruiting at any time of the year. And under ideal conditions these tropical figs produce multiple crops, sometimes one right after another. And they all became part of the messy fig litter.

I don't know when it started, exactly, but we eventually realized that the fig litter was becoming heavier and messier, specifically in the area where we lived. Other places nearby were seemingly unaffected; it was just our neighborhood. At first, we thought maybe climate change, but when we realized the effect was localized, we thought maybe too much fertilizer, perhaps in the form of leaking sewage pipes. But as time went on it became apparent it was because more and more figs were going uneaten.

The birds were no longer eating the figs.

The birds didn't disappear completely from the suburbs or anything. They still flew overhead, they could still be seen in the parks and all the other neighborhoods, but for some strange, unexplained reason, they had now started avoiding our specific area in the suburbs. Birds no longer perched or roosted in our neighborhood.

We probably wouldn't have come to that realization if it weren't for an old couple that happened to be casual birdwatchers, who were the first to noticed and pointed it out to the rest of us.

It was certainly strange, but not that worrying to most of us. Some thought maybe it was some sort of pollution or radiation, or maybe electromagnetic interference in our area, but personally I always thought that maybe some hawk or other aggressive bird had set up a new territory and was driving the other birds away.

It took us much, much longer to realize that the stray cats had started to avoid our area as well.

=======

Life went on as usual. I had school and other matters to attend to. Months passed; I graduated high school and got admitted to a local university, and both of my sisters got married.

It was a bit of a busy time, and I didn't have much time to dwell on the local ecology.

Until one day I came home to find my usually mild-tempered parents with decidedly grim attitudes. I thought maybe someone had died, but it turned out the source of their discontent was disappearing fish.

Our climate was pretty hot, so we couldn't have goldfish and koi. On the bright side, we could keep real tropical fish. We actually caught most of the fish ourselves; the nearby waterways teemed with introduced exotic fish. One of the more common species were Midas cichlids; big, blocky hump-headed fish brilliantly colored in shades of bright orange. We also got a fair number of huge, dull-colored sailfin plecos.

Now on that particular day, we all had to go out for one reason or another. As it was a busy day, we had neglected to check on the pond in the morning. In the afternoon my parents came home to the unpleasant discovery that most of our fish had disappeared.

One or two fish going missing every once in a while isn't too unusual; after all, fish are mortal and do eventually die, and the plecos are effective and ravenous scavengers that dispose swiftly of any remains. But a large number of fishes had simply vanished without a trace; leaving no fishy corpses floating belly-up in the pond. Plecos are formidable eating-machines, but even they couldn't deal with that much carrion in such a short amount of time.

I thought maybe some water birds, like a whole flock of pelicans or cormorants or something, came along when no one was around and feasted on the inhabitants. But I was still amazed by how voracious they must have been; even our biggest plecos were gone. Plecos are an unappetizing-looking fish; with their robust, armored heads, rows of spiky plates down their bodies and the stout spines in their fins, they would be a tough morsel for any predator to swallow whole. Some birds even end up choking on them.

Surprisingly, the only surviving fish were the smaller individuals, presumably those that were able to hide away in the various nooks and crannies of the pond that the larger fish couldn’t squeeze into.

But my parents suspected foul play; some human thief sneaking into our yard and scooping up all the fish. They decided to go around and ask the neighbors if they noticed anything different, like things going missing.

And they came across some rather...peculiar stories.

One family told us that their cats, originally outdoor free-roaming types, had stopped going out at night. Instead, they spent their evenings strictly indoors, pacing around the house and constantly checking the doors and looking out the windows.

One couple had a compost heap in their garden, and a couple of weeks ago they were greeted one morning by the alarming site of their orderly compost heap all torn and dug up, its contents strewn all over the yard. Other neighbors had similar stories of ripped garbage bags and overturned trash cans, or trash being left in strange places, like eaves and balconies and even up in trees. 

One guy said his beans kept going missing from his vegetable patch. Not the peppers, not the eggplants, just the beans. Snake beans, butterbeans, all the bean plants were stripped of their ripening pods whenever he wasn’t around.

But the most perturbing tale of all was relayed to us by the mother of a five-year-old girl, who said her terrified daughter kept insisting that, at night, some long, spindly thing, with long, flat drooping fingers with round, swollen tips, would silently caress the window, seemingly searching for an entrance, which withdrew as soon as the lights were turned on. The mother herself wasn’t too alarmed by the whole situation and assumed it was just a vivid nightmare or the product of an overactive imagination, since there was a tree just right outside the window. After a few sleepless nights she moved her daughter into another room on the other side of the house, and since then the nightmares had all but disappeared.

There wasn't a specific pattern to the incidents. All the affected houses were in the same general vicinity, but some virtually identical houses in the area were unscathed. For whatever reason, certain properties were either skipped or ignored, for whatever reason. 

The culprit had lucked out. Security systems and surveillance cameras may be a thing in more affluent places, but here, they were a rare and usually unnecessary extravagance.

I was intrigued, and decided to investigate. I did a bit of detective work, and got a map of the surrounding properties and marked off the sites of the incidents. It became clear the incidents all occurred within a certain radius. The sites centered around one isolated property, one owned by some middle-aged bald guy who purchased a year or two ago. 

We hadn’t realized before then, but all these strange events, which began with the birds avoiding our neighborhood, had all started after he had moved in by around six months. The property consisted of an old house, not very big, but with a relatively large, walled-off garden, with six magnificent banyans behind the house and one on each side. 

The guy didn't actually reside there, but would come and stay a few days every now and then. According to the few people that spoke with him, this property was apparently his vacation home, and he hoped it would eventually be his retirement home. Once a week, another, younger guy would arrive, an assistant or friend of some sort, and presumably tidy up the place. As a result, we didn't know them very well, but they were polite, and seemed the inoffensive and quiet type, and mostly kept to themselves.

I didn’t share any of my findings with my parents, as I didn’t want to make any false accusations, and the last thing I needed was to have both of them go marching down to the place to confront the guy. Fortunately, they didn’t, but they went ahead and took another course of action.

Armed with the anecdotal information supplied by our neighbors, my parents filed an official report at our local police station, although I doubted the police would consider the case of missing fish a matter of high priority. My parents, however, are masters of theatrics, and using the combined collective of strange stories they managed to construct a much more dramatic narrative, and gave the impression that the situation was much more urgent and serious than it actually was.

Of course, if I could easily figure which house was at the center of the incidents, so could the police. News quickly went around that the police were seen driving up to the place, and the assistant guy had let them enter. The officers mucked around for the whole day before finally leaving. Later, the rumors swirled that one or even both of them had been arrested, but that was soon disproved when they both showed up a week later, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.

As for me, I was pleased that the police shared my suspicions, and I discovered I had developed a taste for detective-work. I went around and, with the permission of the occupants, took a look at each affected house. Each one was more or less similar to our own; a house surrounded by a walled garden. I took a few photos of each one to help me visualize the scene later.

Our neighbors didn’t take the matter as seriously as we did. We initially thought it might have been some sort of animal, maybe even a whole group of them. Monkeys escaped from the zoo? Could monkeys even catch fish? Our pond wasn’t that deep, but it was large, almost half the size of our yard.

However, someone soon pointed out that, at least as far as we knew, seemingly no fruit or vegetables (other than beans) had been taken. Garbage, fish, beans, yes, but nothing else.

We had a couple of small but prolific langsat trees in the backyard. Every day, the ground beneath them would be littered with freshly fallen ripe fruit, yet when our fish disappeared the fruit had remained untouched.

What kind of monkey would go to great lengths to shred garbage bags, raid trash bins, root through a compost heap and catch fish, yet ignore succulent, easily accessible fruit?

Feral cats would ignore fruit, but would they eat raw beans? I've read that domestic felines sometimes eat cooked beans, but raw beans are actually poisonous to cats.

Or maybe the creature had a deficiency or craving for a certain nutrient? It did seem to focus mostly on protein, which would explain it took only the beans. Perhaps a pregnant or lactating animal?

A human culprit, on the other hand, would be smart enough to take just a few fruits from each yard, so that the theft would go unnoticed. But then why steal all the beans so blatantly, and ignore the rest of the vegetables?

The animal theory became even more unlikely after the police informed us that no trace of any creature had been found at any of the sites. You’d expect tracks, hair, urine, feces, half-eaten scraps or something.

Eventually, the neighborhood arrived at another conclusion. The general consensus among our community became that these events were the work of some poor, starving vagrant, desperately seeking some sort of sustenance in our gardens and trash. The general public opinion was sympathetic; even my parents felt pity for the newly-humanized intruder, although were still somewhat resentful of having so many fish taken.

Still, it didn’t explain everything. The culprit ignored certain properties, even those that were adjacent; wouldn’t a desperate and hungry person be thorough and methodical? Clear out each yard before moving on to the next?

Why raid some yards, and leave virtually identical ones unscathed?

Some of these untouched houses had fruit trees in their gardens, like mangoes and litchis, with branches weighed down with fruit, and trash bins overflowing with garbage. The family right next to us had a colossal sapodilla tree with a massive crop of ripe fruit, yet the tree’s bounty remained untouched. I find it hard to believe that any sort of hungry person would ignore a feast like that. Something particularly puzzling was the fact another family had a pond too, one much smaller than ours, and all their fish were accounted for.

Why some houses, and not others?

The police made a big show of sweeping the neighborhood and did a few all-night patrols and vigils, and basically shrugged and gave up.

Meanwhile, people were keeping their doors and windows securely fastened, but otherwise they didn't seem too concerned.

I myself toyed with the idea of setting up a camera or two in the yard, but after looking it up, I realized I lacked both the technical knowledge and funds required, and calling in an expert to do it for me seemed a bit much. I could have eventually learned how to do it myself, but that seemed like too much effort at the time.

I did try staying up one night and keeping watch at the window, but saw nothing. I assumed the perpetrator must have noticed me.

Later still I tried a different tact, and kept watch while in the yard, concealed inside a bush, hoping to catch the thief in the act. I had left out a bowl of leftovers as bait. But after a long and uncomfortable night I didn’t see or hear anything, and I realized it was an exercise in futility. The perpetrator could have come at any time throughout the day; I couldn’t possibly keep watch for 24 hours a day, let alone for several days.

Anyway, I soon gave up on such extreme measures. The allure of being a detective faded. For me, solving the mystery wasn’t something high-priority. It simply became a conundrum I puzzled over in my free time, just a side-project, something to keep me occupied (and a welcome distraction from working on my essays).

Days passed. One lazy afternoon, while I was alone in the house (and feeling particularly disinclined to do academic work), I took out all my notes and spread them over my bed. Just idly reading through the notes, letting my thoughts wander.

I pictured our houses, our yards and gardens.

Planted with flowers, shrubs, and trees.

The trees.

Looming, practically ubiquitous in our neighborhoods.

Tall, immensely vast trees, with massive spreading canopies.

Trees in adjacent yards with their crowns touching.

Rows of trees in the streets and parks.

An interconnected network.

I sat up. I took out the photos I had taken.

I looked at the houses, the sites of the incidents.

Each with at least one massive ficus tree in the garden.

A ficus tree that happened to be touching another ficus. And so on.

I looked out the window, out across our own yard. Our own ficus tree, a massive banyan, was right up against the garden wall, and beyond it was another ficus in the neighbor's yard. The pond was built under its shade, to give the fish some relief from the hot sun.

I remembered the scared girl, her story of the thing at her window. Her mother said there was a tree right outside her window.

I took out a little map of our neighborhood that had the site of each incident clearly marked. I went to my laptop, brought up satellite images of my area, and zoomed in, compared it with the map.

I saw how the trees linked all the sites, their canopies interconnected in one continuous web.

A network connecting all our houses.

No incidents in sites lacking trees, or houses that had single trees isolated in the middle of a lawn or yard.

I remember the neighbors’ untouched fishpond. I checked my photos.

No trees around the periphery of their yard, either in the street or in the garden itself.

I checked the photos of another house that had been spared. No trees in the periphery either.

I check all of the untouched properties. All were just beyond the reach of the communal canopy network.

Cut off. Inaccessible.

It was all starting to make sense.

A human intruder wouldn’t be hindered by the lack of trees.

This was definitely a creature, a being that used the trees to get from place to place.

And whatever it was, it was strictly arboreal. It avoided the ground, its movement constrained by the reach of the branches.

I was getting excited.

Some sort of escaped pet primate? A strictly tree-dwelling species, like an orangutan? Or a gibbon?

At any rate, I was now convinced our mystery culprit was not a person, but a beast. And I realized that the perfect hiding place for a shy creature was most likely in a tree in the most isolated, least occupied house, the one at the epicenter of the incidents; the property owned by the bald man.

=====

I decided to check out the house. It was around noon, so most people around here are at work or at school. Anyway, it's so hot no one would be out and about. Perfect for a bit of snooping. I went up to the door and rang the bell, but no one answered. I expected as much, so I decided to check out the perimeter. Like most of the houses here the property is surrounded by a high wall, but this one was taller than most, being perhaps eight or nine, maybe even ten feet tall.

I walked around to the back. The six banyans in the back garden, with their thick, leafy, interlocking canopies forming an almost jungle-like mound of foliage, would make an ideal home for a bashful tree dweller.

If it was nocturnal, I might even be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of it while it's asleep.

Was the animal a pet of the bald man? Or was he unaware that his garden harbored a mysterious tree-dwelling creature?

I walked right up to the wall, and took note of how the leafy crowns spilled over the wall. In fact, quite a few prop roots had already taken root on this side of the wall. Left unchecked, the trees would probably eventually engulf the wall itself.

Outside the wall, there were trees in the street whose branches intermingled with the banyans.

I looked up into the leaves. You could be walking or driving along the street, and the creature might be right above you, watching, and you’d be none the wiser.

I turned my attention back to the yard. After a moment of hesitation, I jumped up and grabbed the edge of the wall, and pulled myself up to take a look over the edge.

The yard is a bit unkempt, but otherwise looks ordinary. No lawn, a patchy blanket of bark mulch, piles of fallen ficus leaves all over the place, a few shrubs here and there. The massive buttress roots of the banyan trees snake across the yard, forming a woody intermeshed network of winding ridges and canyons.

I don't want to trespass onto private property, but soon I convince myself it's fine as long as I don't actually go over the wall (please don’t actually do this, it is definitely a bad idea but it seemed like a brilliant loophole at the time). I figured no one would mind, I just wanted to take a closer look and peer into the trees.

I hoisted the rest of my body onto the wall, grabbing the branches to help pull me up. I stood on the wall in a half-crouch; the tangle of branches made it hard for me to stand up straight. I slowly and carefully made my way along the wall, grabbing at the branches to steady myself. As I did so, I peered into the leafy tangle, trying to catch a glimpse of the creature, or at least its nest or something.

After that, well, things got a little hazy. I’ll try to reconstruct it the best I can from the bits I remember.

=====

The next thing I know, I’m coming to. I'm in deep shade.

I'm dazed, disoriented. Gradually, I get my bearings.

I'm on my back, sprawled painfully over several massive, meandering buttress roots of a ficus tree.

One particularly gnarled root serves as a very uncomfortable headrest.

The memories start coming back. Me, on the wall, squatting down and getting ready to lower myself off.

A branch slips out of my hand. I'm left clutching a handful of leaves.

I teeter off balance. I panic and jerk back, over-correcting. I topple backwards into the yard.

And here I am.

I try to get up, and cry out in pain.

My left arm's shattered. Alarmingly, I can't move my legs, and my back explodes with excruciating pain.

I'm paralyzed, I think hysterically.

I spend the next few seconds screaming my head off and yelling for help.

I finally stop due to fatigue. I try to calm myself, look around, take note of my surroundings.

I feel very alone.

I yell for help again. I give up after a few minutes. No point in losing my voice, I need to conserve it for later.

It was likely the owner wasn’t even here. Are any of the neighbors around to hear me? The closest houses are still distant; even if anybody's home, it's likely no one's heard my screams.

How long has it been? Judging by the shadows, it was well past noon.

I hadn’t told anyone where I was going. I was a college student; they wouldn’t miss me until next morning.

A sudden thought occurs to me, a flicker of hope. 

I steel myself against the pain, and, twisting slightly, I gingerly extract my phone from my pants.

The front is smashed, the screen frozen and glitched.

I desperately poke the screen, mash the buttons.

The phone is unresponsive.

I fight the rising panic. I try to calm myself by reassessing the situation.

Left arm's useless. Right arm bruised but functional.

I can breathe just fine, although there is a pain in my side when I do so.

I nearly weep in joy when I realize I still feel pain in my legs. I can still wiggle the toes a bit, move the left leg a little. It means my spinal cord isn't severed; there is still a possibility I can eventually walk again.

Assuming I get saved.

I push away that terrifying thought. I prop myself up on my good arm. Lying on the gnarled tree roots is absolute agony.

I look up at the wall.

The drop didn't seem that high; it was landing on these hard, protruding roots that caused the damage and knocked me out.

I realize that, in a way, I am lucky; had I fallen in a slightly different way and at a slightly different angle, I might have broken my neck.

I shudder at the thought.

Should I stay still? Stay where I was? Or should I try to move? Will it aggravate my back injury? I remember reading an article about a guy with a spinal injury who crawled through a field to get help, but he had the use of both of his hands.

The house is pretty far away. Even if I did manage to drag myself to it on one arm, could I gain access in my current state? What if the doors were locked?

Maybe the best strategy would be to continue to call for help, with breaks every now and then to let my voice rest. Surely sooner or later someone would hear.

The broken phone is still in my clutch. Maybe I can throw it over the wall? Catch the attention of a passerby? Although nonfunctional, I’m reluctant to relinquish the only tool I have.

Maybe I can take it apart, use the battery to start a fire somehow? The smoke might catch someone’s attention, there’s plenty of leaves and bark around…

A soft sound from above interrupts my thoughts.

I look up. The foliage is still. There is no breeze.

Yet there is a slight rustling. Very slight.

I strain to listen.

A soft scraping noise accompanies the rustle. The leaves are still motionless.

Something is moving in the canopy.

The creature? Should I yell and scream to scare it away? It might get provoked. Or was it attracted by my yelling earlier?

More rustling and scraping. From a different location in the canopy.

Multiple creatures?

More sounds.

There’s definitely more than one; there are many rustles and scrapes. Converging from throughout the canopy towards my location.

I stare into the foliage, trying to make out what they are.

I see leaves twitching and moving as something passes them by...

I see leaves push other leaves.

Wait.

Leaves pushing other leaves?

The leaves are moving.

The leaves are actually moving on their own.

I can’t believe my eyes.

I see a woody liana slithering along the branches. Scraping softly.

I see the leaves attached to the vine, leaves that move like the legs of an insect, pulling the vine along like a centipede.

I lay there, dumbfounded, as several vines start making their way down the prop roots.

The leaves are glossy and oval and taper into a point; they superficially resemble the large leaves of their ficus home. The woody liana, too, could easily be mistaken for one of the myriad aerial roots of their banyan host. Almost perfect camouflage.

Each vine has multiple branches and offshoots. They approach ever closer, slowly and with purpose.

I see that each leaf is drawn out into a curly tendril or tentacle, coiled up behind the body of the leaf, and used to provide traction.

And as the vines descend, the leaves unfurl and extend their tendrils to their full length, exposing the tips which had been concealed from view.

And on the tip of each tendril is a swelling that inflates and extends into a hollow cylinder, unfurling like a sock being turned inside-out. It opens up into a gourd or jug-shaped urn, with an open mouth and hinged cap acting as a lid, and a fleshy rim like a pair of round, open lips.

Pitcher plants.

Some pitchers, the ones carried by the leaves nearer the tip of the vine, the newly-opened ones, were bright shades of reddish orange and orange gold, the colors all fresh and candy-like. As you went along the vine, they turned a purplish-red or reddish purple, the newer color replacing the old one in spots and patches. The oldest pitchers were mostly various shades of brown, with blotches and specks of their former colors.

As the approach closer, I see that the colors actually shift and change, complex patterns rippling and moving in fluid animation, like the skin of a cuttlefish, or an electronic display. The young pitchers had thick bands of purplish-magenta pulsing and flowing down their lengths, while the mature pitchers made their spots and blotches move along their surface, contracting then expanding, then radiating outwards in concentric circles. The oldest pitchers, the brownish ones, shifted from dark chocolate to rich caramel to pale tan and every shade of brown in between, and had the spots pulsate, fade then reappear in changing patterns, then merge into thin broken lines of color moving in waves down their length.

Despite my situation, I still found it in me to marvel at this unprecedented natural wonder. My eyes are transfixed by the mesmerizing patterns moving over the pitchers.

The moving patterns alternately speed up, then slow down, my heart-rate seemingly in sync.

A dense, musky scent, like a perfectly ripe guava, wafts through the air. 

As the vines approach, they extend the pitchers towards me. The biggest traps are as nearly as long as my forearm. Their openings gently mouth my arm, smearing me with some sort of clear, viscous liquid, like sanitizer gel.

I'm looking at all this while in some sort of daze. Like I'm entranced, or stoned, or both.

Is it the strange, intoxicating scent? Is it the hypnotic shifting patterns that tickle my eyes like optical illusions? I don't really care at this point. I no longer feel any pain.

Yet there's a tiny bubble of panic in the back of my mind, as I continue to marvel at these pitchers as they gently mouth and caress my arms, my torso, my chest, my legs...

My legs.

My legs are covered in clear slime, multiple pitchers moving smoothly over them, dribbling the clear sticky liquid from the mouths.

In my trance, I had allowed the pitchers to completely ensnare me in a slimy coat.

The spell is broken. I snap out of my stupor.

My panic response floods back in full force.

The built-up panic is overwhelming and bursts out of me explosively. I screech as I suddenly spasm in terror, then scream again as my body vehemently protests in excruciating pain.

The pitchers, perhaps sensing I was no longer under their influence, no longer gently caress. Instead, each fastens its mouth to me like a suction cup, and wraps its tendril around whatever it can.

They start pulling back into the tree. Dragging me along in a slimy cocoon.

The pain and the realization of my plight brings my thoughts back into focus, the panic now receding into background as a buzzing undercurrent.

Despite the agony, and at the risk of permanently paralyzing myself, I decide I must try to escape the plant’s slimy grasp at any cost.

I try to twist and thrash about, to the best of my ability. I struggle to free my good arm

It's no use.

The more I move, the thicker and stickier the goo becomes, and the tighter it clings. It's like struggling through molasses or drying glue at this point. And wherever the slime contacts my flesh, it tingles and burns like a corrosive chemical.

They drag me over the roots to the trunk, every jerk and bump igniting an unbelievable agony in my arm and back.

I scream, curse and yell all the way.

When I reach the base of the trunk, they start hoisting me into the canopy feet-first.

My mind is in a daze from the pain. My throat's raw from the screaming.

One last desperate thought occurs to me.

I try to bite at the tendrils and the slime, but to no avail. The goo is wrapped tightly around my neck like a collar made of resin. I can’t twist my head far enough.

I’m exhausted. Despair grips me. There's no escape.

I resentfully resign myself to a painful and horrible death. I would have liked to die with dignity, I think bitterly to myself.

It pulls me into a more horizontal position, onto a large branch. The vines wrap around me, the leaves enveloping me almost tenderly, like sepals protecting a flower.

Will it start feeding on me here and now, bathe me in acidic juices and enzymes?

Slurp up my liquefying tissues while I’m being digested alive?

Suddenly, they all pause, then shudder.

Several pitchers lift into the air, waving around.

I hear a loud, aggressive rustling. Something is moving with arrogant and deliberate oafishness through the canopy of the adjacent banyan.

Another group of vines emerges from the neighboring tree, spilling onto the branches.

These vines have even bigger leaves and traps, and its pitchers are even more brightly-colored, exploding in a dazzling display of vivid bands and spots as their mouths flare and undulate threateningly.

The vines clutch me even tighter as the smaller plant's traps answer with their own display, stripes rippling angrily and menacingly.

The scent of guava is now replaced by something harsher, more pungent and acrid, like a mix of vinegar and hospital disinfectant.

The two plants display and posture for a while, pitchers gaping and writhing.

Then, the larger pitchers surge forward and latch onto me with their mouths like botanical lampreys.

They try to push and pry the smaller pitchers off of me, but the latter continue to try and maintain their hold on me.

Branches and leaves shake vigorously around me. Pitchers slither and grapple with each other, each plant trying to twist off the traps of the other.

The larger plant starts to pull me away, but the smaller plant doesn't give up so easily and clings even more tenaciously to me, wrapping its vines and tendrils around the surrounding branches.

The larger plant is stronger, and gradually, through sheer brute force, starts dragging me to the outer branches, attempting to get me back into its own tree.

The branches here on the periphery are thinner, spindlier. Brittle.

This is ludicrous. I’m stiff with terror as I sway and bounce precariously in the grasp of the two sparring plants, each trying to weaken the grip of the other.

Suddenly, the branches beneath me break under my weight and give way.

In the midst of their struggle, neither plant has a proper grip on me.

For the second time that day, I plummet towards the earth.

=====

The next thing I remember is seeing a bright light and then gasping awake, scaring the living daylights of the intern shining a light into my eye. I was in the emergency room of our local hospital.

The next events all pass in a blur. I remember an overexcited intern who kept reassuring me and patting my shoulder and being poked with needles. My clothes are covered with a sticky residue and I have dead ficus leaves stuck on all over. My exposed flesh is covered in what appear to be chemical burns.

Eventually, though, I became awake enough to ask how I got here. While testing my reflexes and the sensation in my legs, the doctor told me that it was the property owner who found me and called an ambulance. No mention of any ambulatory plant monsters.

Later on, when I'm finished with imaging studies and comfortably admitted to the ward, the doctor comes to me with some good news; images of my head show no bleeding, fractures, or any other sort of injury, though they'll have to repeat them in a few days to be sure. While my back is pretty messed up, there's no major displacement. I’m later scheduled for surgery on my fractured arm and on my back to stabilize the vertebrae. 

Later still, my parents came to visit. They were equal parts reproachful, angry and relieved. After I reassured them, they finally calmed down enough to tell me to be thankful that the owner of the property, a Mr. Burton, was kind enough to not press any charges against trespassing.

Stunned, I sat there speechless as they told me the police now think I'm the prime suspect behind the incidents. I tell them what really happened, but judging by my mother's stony visage (and my father's increasingly bewildered one), they didn't believe a single word I said. My mother scolded me when I finished, and instructed me not to say anything without the presence of a lawyer. When visiting hours were over and they reluctantly left, I get the distinct feeling that they think I'm the thief too.

=====

It's been a few months now. I've been discharged home. My surgeries were successful, and the doctors think that, with plenty of physical therapy, I should be able to walk again. I get around in a wheelchair, but I can stand for a few seconds and move my feet a little. Our house now has a little ramp at the front door and gate. My left arm no longer carries a cast, but still pains me and is a little stiff.

I've started attending classes again. Normalcy is reassuring; having a daily schedule keeps me occupied and brings some well-needed order into my life.

The police never came to interview me. Nobody in our neighborhood wanted to press any charges, so the case was closed, and very little of it has appeared in the media. Apparently, my parents had gone around and done some damage control and made reparations, so it was all settled. No mention of me or my family's name. My parents never bring up ""the incident"" again, and quickly suppress all of my attempts to discuss it.

At any rate, things are more or less back to normal, although now everyone in the neighborhood thinks I am (or rather, formerly was) a tree-climbing pervert and miscreant. There is an uncomfortable distance, a certain frigidness in how they interact with me and my family now, although I'm hopeful one day relations will eventually thaw.

The incidents have all stopped. Although I'm glad for the community, I am a bit upset that the timing makes me look all the more guilty. Burton must have found a way to restrain those plants so they don't wander off the property.

I remember the house was surrounded by giant ficus trees. Did he have one in each tree?

I would have thought I had just imagined the whole thing, if it weren't for one, or rather two, little things.

The hospital gave me back my things, including for some reason the clothes that they had to cut off of me. They were still covered all over with a dried, sticky, gummy residue, with bits of fallen figs and bark chips and fallen leaves stuck to them.

And stuck to it is one special leaf, withered into brown leather and oval-shaped, like a big ficus leaf. Except the tip extends into a tendril that ends with a shriveled pitcher. I keep it, just in case.

The other thing stuck to my pants was a little, white plastic rectangle with a dirt-covered spike at one end that must have been a plant marker. It had something scrawled on it:

*Nepenthes dendrophila* susbsp. *macrostoma*

I looked it up; that name doesn’t exist. It must be a newly discovered or as of yet undescribed species.

I see no point in pursuing the matter further. I've thought of contacting or confronting Burton, but unless he goes public with his plants, I see no point in doing so now. We've all moved on with our lives, and I think I’ve been nosy enough.

Our pond's restocked now with freshly caught feral Midas cichlids and a couple of plecos. Not a single one has gone missing so far.

I myself made a little personal contribution to the fish collection. One day I passed by the local pet shop, which was closing down and having a clearance sale. The very last fish they had was all by itself in a half-filled tank with a barely functioning filter. It was a brownish, tilapia-like fish the size of my hand, with spiky fins and bronze-colored eyes, and was labeled as a “walking gourami”. I was intrigued by its grumpy visage, and sympathized with its plight, so I bought it at a generous discount, and after a short spell in a quarantine tank it was introduced to our pond. It seemed to fit in just fine.

I later identified as a climbing perch. And while I was researching it, I came across an interesting little story or legend about it. I guess I managed to solve a long-standing mystery of natural history.

I think I’ve figured out why and how the climbing perch sometimes ends up in trees."

I have narrowed my schools down to these, and I am having trouble choosing. Cost of attendance for both schools are very similar.

## University of Texas-Dallas

* Not as highly ranked as Madison
* [CS^2 honors program](https://cs.utdallas.edu/computingscholars/), essentially a small group of honors students
* Priority registration for classes
* Nice dorms (i.e. I get a room with a closing door to myself)
* Suburb - I'm not so sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing - more quiet (I like quiet) but less things to do without a car

## University of Wisconsin-Madison

* Very highly ranked in CS, well known
* No (useful) honors program, but potentially ""honors in the major"" (for later)?
* No priority registration
* Maybe single dorms, but not guaranteed (I like single dorms)
* City - too many parties for me, but I can just walk around the city and have things to do if I feel like it

I have visited both schools and I don't really have anything going for nor against one or the other, really.

Mostly looking for program quality, internships, and employability after graduation in the CS field.

Any thoughts? Thanks!"

There's a high possibility that I will be hired as a SOC Analyst Intern soon by a certain company that primarily uses AlienVault.

I was wondering if you know of any or multiple resources online to help someone learn about the SIEM from scratch; courses, youtube videos, or specific sites that give you a good overview of how it currently looks and operates (all I've been seeing are 2014 videos on youtube).

Rejections were because I’m not qualified enough (as a sophomore I don’t have a lot of experience except being in a few clubs and doing projects) or my year doesn’t match with the year required. I feel defeated. This semester is about to end and I have nothing lined up for summer. Makes me feel as if something is wrong with me.

I'm 18yo and from Austria where I will soon graduate from what here is called a higher technical school for information technology. I am not sure whether that is a thing in the US or anywhere else.

Essentially it is 5 years from 14yo to 19yo of learning IT in addition to what you'd learn in high school. I am proficient in Java and Python, know a bit of C# and C and am good with SQL among some other technologies. 

I always liked maths and especially writing programms that involve a lot of math, which I have done in 4 months of internships as of now. (Computer Vision, AI, and some statistics related stuff)

So now as someone that wants to keep doing that kind of math heavy programming, I was wondering whether it would be a better choice to get a bachelor in CS or technical mathematics (or maybe even pure mathematics?)

I am kind of worried that maths is considered a bit less useful by employers but I really like the idea and in my very limited experiences the both more challenging and more interesting aspects of my work where the mathematical problems themselves and much less the implementation of the solutions once found?

Can someone give me a bit of insight or things I should think of/consider when making the choice between the two?"

I'm planning on applying in computer or aerospace engineering. My first instinct is that this wouldn't matter to the colleges at all, but I thought I'd ask because it would fit my theme and sounds like a more enjoyable way to make a bit of money this summer. I've applied to some other programs, but I'm not sure where to find internships that are available to high school students in the areas I'm interested in.

I was accepted into UMass Amherst and University of Rochester when applying for computer science. I would have to pay 20K less if I went to UMass per year. I have limited experience in the field, and I want to use my 4 years in college learning CS, being able to get internships, and opportunities to work hands-on in the field.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
Is there an artist you've wanted to work with but never had the opportunity?|Adele, Shawn Mendez, Demi Lovato, Billie Eilish, i'm sure there's more but i'd walk across glass to work with them
Are artists like Eminem,Taylor Swift or Jay z cool to work with because they are known to be very private people. Do you have any stories about them for us about how was your meeting with them?|there is no singularly better moment in life than when Eminem personally calls you to compliment your work and to ""Keep killing it Ken"". fuck a plaque, thats a movie in my brain. Jay Z i met thru Just Blaze so the times i was around Jay (and Bey) i was a known previously vetted entity to them that they didn't have to worry about, and both are very down to earth cool natural people. i dont know them well at all, only been in rooms together a few times, but nothing like recording Beyonce!!
Is there a lot of drug use in the studio to get the creative thinking process going?|i hear about it more than i'd like to. I use THC medically, and i do also find it to be a creative drug sometimes. I've never done anything else so i dont know. THC is great because it allows you to not care about the outside world and focus on your creativity, but it sucks for trying to be a super productive human.
Hi ! Who is, in your opinion, an underrated producer that deserves way more recognition? What album you dream you had produced?|Emile Haynie I think is a name that isn't widely circulated but he is one of the absolute top producers in the business.
Hey ken!!! I’ve been having a really hard time cleaning up my vocals in the mix. I use an SM7b. I have a tiled room and a small rug and couch (bad for recording I know). I’m just curious, how much does recording in an actual booth actually effect the clarity of the vocal? And how would you go about EQing a vocal recorded in a bad room? Also must have plugins??|you NEED to tighten up your room significantly if you are cutting vocals. it should not sound reverberant at all, deader the better, throw down rugs, blanekts on the floors and walls, you can construct a blanket house around the mic. all help focus the voice, drier the better during the recording
Are there any projects you can talk about that you worked on but never got to see them release?|i mixed a cover of ""Black Butterfly"" for Mary J Blige featuring Kelly Price and Terrell Hicks many years ago, thats one of the best works i've ever mixed and nobody will ever hear it. There's a ton of that in the music industry.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
You gotta release it man!|i do not own or control the rights. Client files are the absolutely most valuable thing any of us ever touch, i dont have the mix but if i did i would never leak it. I might call Mary J one day and see if she can leak it, bet she totally forgot about that recording but it is MAGIC. orchestra, live band, produced by Puffy's Hit Men. Tony Maserati was supposed to mix it and he got caught on another project and asked me if i could mix it.
^(the below is another reply to the reply to the answer)|
In the US the songwriter/copyright holder has the right to first release. It would be a really bad idea to release someone else’s song, that’s how Nicki Minaj just paid half a million dollars to Tracy Chapman when her track leaked with an uncleared sample on it.|yeah, i dont have a half million dollars to spare
What are the worst studio manners you have encountered?|i've had 2 different studio owners challenge me to fights only to immediately back down when i began walking toward them like i was happy to hear the request.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Any chance you could detail one of these occasions? Haha|One was The Carriage House in CT. I was engineering for Diana Ross. Back then as a freelancer i traveled with my C800g, 2 full racks of gear, a keyboard, my guitar, speakers, and other potential studio tools.
 |Day 1 Carriage House i unload all my gear myself and hump it in, set most of it up. (this is not ever what happens in NYC)
 |Day 2, repeat Day 1, plus my ""assistant"" is like a ghost, never in the room and not the most working room. lets also keep in mind its a Diana Ross session.
 |Day 3, repeat day 1 and 2, no load in help at all. So i go back to the fucker who owns the place sitting in the back office, and i stand in the doorway and very politely with a calm voice say ""Can i please ask you to ask your assistants to work harder for me? I've loaded in all of my own gear three days in a row""
 |His response (I shit you not) ""Why?! Are your arms broken?!""
 |It took me a few moments to realize what he had just said to me, and right about as it was hitting me, he says ""If you dont like it here I'll just cancel the session right now and you can go somewhere else""
 |My response: ""go ahead and call Diane and let her know""
 |then he takes a couple steps towards me and challenges me to a fucking fight right there in his office. It took him about 1 second to realize that i had very happily accepted the challenge and he backed down before i finished walking across the room towards him.
 |I'm old and withered now, but i was scrappy fucker in my youth and strong as hell. We moved to Resonance Studios and i never saw that piss ant again.
 |I also hold the record for the latest Diana Ross has ever stayed in the studio (over 6 albums span of recording at Carriage House, she stayed up later happily working with us than any other session she had ever done there. For some reason that made the owner salty cause he had to wait and drive her home that night and he wanted us to end before Midnight. Not my fault he had chauffeur duties, i had songs to record and she had a glass of wine and a smile in the vocal booth.
What are some “green flags” that a record you are working on is going to be successful or a hit? Aside from the obvious being an already successful and established artist. I’m curious if there are any specific signs to look out for during the writing, preproduction, tracking, or even mixing processes. As a producer myself, I am always looking for patterns or commonalities in the relative “successes” that I am a part of, to possibly keep them in my mental toolkit.|artists that grind. the hardest working talented artists tend to be the most successful. At some level there is no replacement for hard work. Trying to keep everyone enjoying what they are doing and feeling proud of their work helps greatly too
Hey Ken, I’m having a real hard time with mixing/mastering, what are some of your tips? I don’t know when my songs sound “right”. I can put together a decent song, but it doesn’t sound ever sound polished. P.S Does mixing/mastering have less of an effect on midi layers? Should it always be done on audio layers? Thank you tons.|come to my Youtube.com/mixingnight broadcast tonight. You are my target audience :-) Best quick tip, try using A/B plugins like Plugin Alliance Metric AB, thats what i use, you can load in and level match reference songs then you can listen back and forth between that song and your own song in real time and make adjustments. it can really help young mixers bring certain elements into focus
Amazing resume! How does a talented aspiring bedroom producer gain recognition in the music industry with zero connections?|network in a smart respectful way. Nobody owes you a thing, nor do they care about you. You need to provide or show value to the person that you want reach, quickly and susinctly, or slowly over time with relationship building. Make yourself needed, or valuable, to your listeners, to artists, to other creatives, everyone has a different path. Make great music and make yourself valuable to other people who recognize your talent and are currently much better at it than you. This is a long road.
What advice would you give someone who is trying to break into the music industry?|its microscopic. it looks gigantic, but its not. at my general level, everybody either knows everybody or has 1 degree of separation. People talk, so do good business, dont be a douche, network to people who have something to offer. ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN before you stick your hand out to someone like me wanting a hand up the next level. Anyone in a position like mine has gone thru tremendous sacrifice to get here, when the young artist with the hand out comes along, its very off putting. show me your value for real. you will never talk someone into believing in your talent
How much of their real voice is in the songs and how much sound effects are there to make them sound good? And do do you know any artists that have 0 connection to music but the producers made their songs a hit?|there are small studio tricks but mostly, the artists who make it to major label level are usually pretty fucking good. Not always. and i have used autotune on the very best singers too sometimes. Its a tool and someone like me is stupid to not use a tool that improves my overall work. Some artists are a bit manufactured, but its rare, you're over thinking it. Most of the time, beyond the quick break thru til tokers who wont be here next year, it usually takes talent and an insane work ethic to break thru
Have you ever been roughed up by a performer's posse because of a software crash? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwgR4HNNEQc|close. not over a software crash. Grand Puba (90's rapper) threatened me with a beat down if i didn't find his cassette with his album on it that he lost. They found it a half hour later in the menu book. Special Ed pulled a razor on me in a different session. Oh the 90's
Many say that music is subjective, but what are some of the “dos and don’ts” of producing?|dont sign anything important without having an entertainment lawyer advise you properly.
 |if you get that big breakthrough opportunity, stay humble, and figure out how to grind twice as fucking hard, cause repeating that feat is going to be very very difficult. When the success begins to come you double down
How does your approach/mindset change as you switch between genres or artists?|there are certain stylistic things, like rock is usually less sub heavy and hip hop is usually heavier, so there are understanding the basic norms of that genre if they exist, but only to inform me about the song in front of me. that mindset is basically work on the song until we know its great, if we think it can be
Hey Ken, thanks so much for doing this. If you could only have one mic to record all the vocals you’ve ever recorded or will record, which one would it be?|Sony C800g and in fact i have used almost solely my mic to record vocalists I've worked with since the mid 90's. That mic has had some real Karma flow thru it
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
My dream mic! Though I do own a Manley Reference so i'm more than happy with that.|thats the very closest to a C800g
for someone just starting, (e.g., playing around in Ableton) do you have any general bits of guidance or rules of thumb for good practices in mixing sound?|its going to take you a while to make things sound really good, part of the fun is going thru the process, so just know your work will get better over time, you'll learn your gear and develop your skills
What's the biggest problem with the music industry nowadays? Is it Spotify and other streaming services?|corporations grab every penny they can, find new ways all the time, and its insanely difficult for us to track and collect our money once its out there and earning. Its even tougher to get that first thing to start earning.
Who was the most difficult artist to work with, and who did you enjoy spending time with the most?|Diana Ross was suuuuuuper fun the first couple sessions, then not so much after that.
 |David Byrne was one of the funnest albums i've ever made ""Look Into The Eyeball""
 |Usher and Ariana Grande have more of whatever ""it"" is than anyone else i've been in a room with and they are both awesome people
How did you get in the music business? Thinking about streams and how we consume music, what do you think it's the future of the market?|played guitar since 10, graduated Berklee College of Music 1991, got out, got a job in a studio in Ohio for a year then moved to NYC when my real education began in 1993. Started as staff assistant/intern at Soundtrack Studios, NYC, moved up, stacked credits, went freelance, luckily survived it.
Hey Ken first of all thank you for this amazing ama. Please tell me how do you know when your mix is done and how you keep yourself from not over doing it? Also is it possible to not making your ears tired after more than 2-3 hours of mixing, I struggle with that mostly.|a lot of practice. good monitoring so you don't need to crank it up to hear it clearly, turn it up only for loudness checks and short vibes. drink water. sleep 7-8 hours a night you'll hear better and feel more creative.
What are your thoughts on how media conglomerates influence popularity and dictate who gets played? How much of an artist's message is controlled?|they still control quite a lot, streaming can be the great equalizer, sometimes sync can too. but usually only if you are great and have some marketing savvy
How awesome are the Wu Tang?|they aint nuttin to fuck wit :-)
 |Before i mixed the secret double album ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin"" a single copy resides in a government locker right now, i had already worked with each Wu member on something else individually. I've worked on a loooooooooot of hip hop
When working with BTS did you get feedback or exchange ideas with the majority of members or did you primarily work with one, such as Suga?|i mainly get called to mix the songs featuring Suga, RM, and J Hope. Feedback comes via email, all comments organized, we go back and forth on revisions until a mix is 100% finished and signed off on by the group, label, producers, etc....
Just checked out your website and you have worked with an insane amount of talent. How did you build that list up? Were you already connected to a network of professional musicians when you started?|No, i got in as an intern at a studio in NYC and worked my way all the way up. Its one foot in front of the other for 29 years and im here. no silver bullets for me
What do you like to listen to when you aren’t working?|silence. beautiful silence. i work all the time. i often take in the Spotify New Music Friday playlist or the Rock This playlist,
Did you meet BTS in person? How was your experience with them?|Not all of them, RM was at my studio finishing his solo EP the day after he spoke at the UN General Assembly. that was pretty special :-)
What would be your dream project?|i have an amazing place with a studio in Ecuador, i'd love to shack up down there with a bunch of killer creatives and make someone's album start to finish. I think it would be cheap and the vibe down there is just bananas, nobody is ever on my beach for miles and miles.
How would an artist go about trying to get their instrumentals into the hands of A&amp;R, or get their mixing out there to begin mixing again?|produce local artists, hone your craft, create some real bangers with artists on them, THAT is a much more powerful tool for reaching A&amp;R's than sending them a hot beat, 1 million people can make hot beats
Who is the most humble person/group you've worked with?|Usher. David Byrne. Beyonce. Jay Z. Bruno Mars. Alicia Keys. Eminem, Mark Ronson, many others are all really humble down to earth people. People are people
Favourite artist you‘ve worked with? Like, the easiest/most satisfying colaboration, and favourite memory from it.|Favorite artist for an extended period is probably David Byrne, but that was as an engineer, mixer and musician
What genre do you gravitate the most toward? And who are your biggest musical inspirations?|rock and urban mostly, pop with BTS of course but i tend to mix more for their rappers. musical inspirations are typically everybody i get to interact with in a year from all over the world, i think it shapes me every year with new influences
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
you did a fantastic job on ""UGH!"" and dis-ease, those 2 are among ARMY's all-time favorites!|thank you so much!!!!! Dis-ease was a super challenge to mix, but i am very happy with how it turned out!
What is your process of creating original melodies like? Do you have a favorite chord progression or instrument?|its all vibe. its almost always all vibe. and i carry around my phone and any time an idea pops in, it gets voice noted
How do you see the future of the industry from where you are today? What kind of world do you think songwriters and producers and performers are going to be living in post-pandemic?|i predict touring back in 2022, a bit here and there before but not in earnest. live-streaming can be crucial. networking, i find Clubhouse is an amazing networking tool
Was there any point in your career where you felt you had ended up in the wrong 'place', and felt (panicked, may be) that you must change directions, work harder even, to move on?|probably most of my career
Will you AMA again after you retire and you can give us the good answers that don't affect your ability to work in the future?|if i am asked. but some secrets stay in the studio
If you ran for President, what would be your campaign song?|is there a song called Legalize it? We could use the tax revenue right now. I have a medical card and still cant get the shit that would help me the most :-)
If you could explain it, I’d be really curious to know about some of your musical process. What key concepts make your production stand out from the rest?|my productions tend to have a signature of some sort, something you've never heard that identifies that song to you. i hear beats from producers that anybody could have made and i literally think ""anybody could have made this"", put in some sort of sound i haven't heard or a catchy melody that grabs me in a fresh way and then you might really have something
Who's the biggest diva you've worked with? Or if you don't want to say, what's the most diva-ish thing they've done.|Diana Ross
Any advise for a broke young musiclover who would love to be a producer one day?!|there are a TON of great free creative tools out there. I have a segment on my youtube.com/mixingnight broadcast called ""Marcus Manderson Mixing Night Man of Mystery"" where he finds all the coolest free software and shows you what it does and where to find it. He has another segment tonight and you can easily find all of his previous at my Discord Mixing Night channel, where Marcus posts an absolute treasure trove of well sourced free stuff. BOOM, no more excuses
When credited as ""Arr,"" how piratey does that make you feel?|quite piratey actually!! It can be ARRanged for you to walk the plank :-)
Hey Ken! In your experience, do producers still mentor up and comers? I know so many big name producers have found not only their voice/sound, but success after being taken under the wing of a predecessor. If so, do you feel like it’s worth it to reach out to people? So many DMs go unread nowadays (I don’t blame them for that at all). What would be the best way to reach out to someone without getting brushed aside?|you only need one of those to be answered. and make sure your approach is respectful, centered on them, and how you can help them. They already KNOW how they can help you.
How was the language barrier when working with BTS?|its not. I dont need to understand a lyric to feel the emotion conveyed or that i want it to convey. i just do what feels right
Do producers\* get paid on an hourly rate, or are you put on a retainer for the duration of a project's assembly? edit:\*|usually per project. Most of the time nowadays i am doing artist development, so its zero pay up front, high risk, usually no reward, but every now and then one hits really well and you eat for a long time from that. Up front fees are nice too, I take them when they make sense
When you put on your pants in the morning, do you do it like the rest of us, but yours make platinum records?|sometimes only gold like Bruce Dickenson
Thanks for doing this!! Do you have any tips for a hobbyist/amateur producer?|seriously, check out my free livestream from the studio, www.Youtube.com/MixingNight
 |it will teach you a lot and entertain you at the same time
every producer does things to make ""their sound"". what would you say is your sound or signature mark, and what do you do to make it?|my signature is making the artist sound like the best version of themselves that they could not have gotten to on their own.
How was working with the Wu-tang Clan ?|never been in the same room with more than one or two of them at a time but worked individually for them all at some point long before i mixed Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. Raekwon threatened me once, that was kinda funny, he thought i erased his vocals. ""Dude i'm here to fix that shit, do you think i would be here if i erased it""
What advice do you have for someone starting out as an engineer today? I just graduated from SF State with a degree in music production and would love to know what worked for you and what didn’t. Cheers!|work for people much better than you and learn everything you can, build relationships. everybody wants to rush straight to engineer land. your not ready, shit takes time, keep learning
What's the best way for new artists to get in touch/scouted?|create something undeniable, then network like crazy. almost everyone skips step 1.
What's your favorite song?|Purple Rain
Hi Ken! I have two questions. What are your favorite plugins? And what are some producer tips you would give to your younger self?|UAD is always a fav. Pultec Pro Legacy is amazing. producer tips, listen to more music and be a complete student of the game
Whats the best way for a producer to start getting traction for his music? Also what is the best way to pursue music production? Is it risky to go all in?|yes its risky. you should read a book by a great producer who went all in. S1 Pray Focus Plan Execute. great read, audio book as well.
What's your favorite cheese?|hard cheese, something high quality, aged 5 years
As a producer working with big name clients, how involved are you with the writing process? Generally, do artists come in with mostly finished tracks, or ideas and concepts that you help flesh out? Are you credited as songwriter in those situations or only as producer?|there is no one way, each situation is different and can happen as described and any number of other ways. sometimes a beat goes out and thats it, sometimes you spend months crafting the perfect album. everything between
I do some producing as a hobby (mainly pop) and use Reason (PC, not Mac). If I were to try and take things to the next level, do you recommend I learn one of the more commonly used DAWs like Pro tools? Would sticking to just Reason end up being a hindrance? Thank you!|if you can get results in your DAW, stick with it, tons of the hip hop guys use FL and have smashes
How do you overcome writer’s block when producing? What are some more creative ways of coming up with ideas that don’t involve sitting at the computer for hours?|you grind thru it or you totally change your environment and stimuli for a while
Hey! I’m a producer in Toronto, Ontario trying to make it big using Audacity! Kanye is my biggest inspiration, what did you learn working with him? Can’t wait to check out your stuff and thanks for doing this! 🙏|Kanye is a brilliant producer. He could easily produce all of his music himself and it would still be dope AF. He's always been smart enough to surround himself with other top level creatives who can bring new ideas in and help him explore his creative vision. That is exactly what a smart artist should probably be doing, and the records speak for themselves
Any genres you’d like to get into but haven’t?|Country
Which artist, once they started playing their instrument, made you go ""wow"" the most?|George Benson. he was a medium for music, its simply flowed thru him so effortlessly it was stunning to watch, and i wasn't a fan, but i recognize other worldly talent
I don't recognize any of the names you mentioned, except Taylor Swift, is this because I'm old?|yes. its ok, everybody loves different music, thats the power of music
What was the moment in your life where you decided “Yeah, this is it, this is what I want to do with my life?”|8 years old for wanting to be a musician, and 16 years old for knowing i loved the studio aspect of it all
Does the toilet paper go over or under?|over
What would be your 3 top VST plug-ins that don’t cost a fortune?|i have a Mixing Night Discord community and Marcus Manderson posts all of the best and most usable free shit there, check it out!!! tons of killers
What's your favorite sandwich?|i cant eat bread anymore, so there's that. slices of lunchmeat by themselves work for me tho, i am quite a utilitarian eater most of the time, but i certainly enjoy great food.
Nightwish, a pretty big player in the European metal scene, just had their bassist/co-(male)vocalist Marko Hietala [leave the band](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ7_1sIB7m7/). Of interest to me is his comments about tour promoters basically sucking the joy out of music. With your experience, curious about your thoughts of the current state of the music industry, particularly with how he portrays the tour promoters and streaming companies?|corporations have figured out how to game the shit out of the music industry and they know all us creators are prolly gonna create regardless cause we're driven to. so less pie for all of us in some ways, but also tech has been the great field leveler as well and more artists now than in any time in history are eating solely off their artist income due to streaming and / or sync.
Any advice for aspiring music artists in this climate?|connect with your fans and create great music.
Hi Ken, I would like to know, how much singers influence your work(are present). If so, how often are you with them? Thank you so much.|i LOVE producing vocals and i think i am very good at bringing out the best in an artist that they didn't know they had to give. any time i'm producing a song i'm usually producing the vocal performance, not always
Did you greenlight 34 + 35 by Ariana Grande and if so, why?|i haven't worked with Ari in many years. I'd love to again someday. She is hands down one of the best vocalists i have ever produced, recorded, or mixed, period. Surreal vocal abilities with the ability to connect it to real emotion
What did you think of JLo's performance at the inauguration today?! It was great!|She can sing!!! i was very surprised and pleased. she must have worked very hard on her voice over the years, kudos to her it was a real American moment
Did you ever fuck wit the Wu Tang?|everybody knows they aint nuttin 2 fuk wit. Best rap group in history
What are your favorite DAWs and VSTs?|i use Logic for creation but dont love it, Mixing is pro tools on an analog SSL, rough mixes ITB
Would you ever work with other producers outside of your scope/style? I’m a big metal fan but I also love hip hop, rap and RnB. I’d love to see the day where a good enough fusion between more popular music and rock/metal comes about. An amazing producer currently in metal would be someone like Mick Gordon. Could you ever do such a thing? And if not, what obstacles would dictate so?|i love collaborating outside comfort zones. can be awkward or amazing
[removed]|haven't had lunch yet. had a keto bar and coffee for breakfast but its not even 4pm yet. thanks for reminding me, i think i could really benefit from some calories right now
I'm a big Kanye fan. Is there anything about him which you haven't seen from anyone else? Or what was your best and worst experience with him?|nobody else is remotely similar to Kanye, he is a One of One. And even a bad day w Kanye is probably a gold record on your wall. He's brilliant. among a zillion other things, Kanye's chop game w samples is maybe only rivaled by Just Blaze
How did you find the first people to collaborate with when starting out? How did you branch out following those initial steps?|i worked for others for many years, learning my crafts building my relationships and clientele , THEN i went freelance
What are your go-to plugins/gear to add sizzle/sparkle to your mixes?|Black Box HG-2, Kush Clariphonic, Slate Fresh Air are all pretty dope
If someone asked you to prepare a Greek influenced breakfast burrito, what ingredients would you put in it?|goat
what are the best ways to penetrate the industry? (in essence, how does one go from a regular job with little or no contacts in the industry, to becoming an important person in the industry)|make yourself valuable. Thats it. The sum total advice for everybody. There is no room in the music industry for new people who just want in, you need to earn in and make yourself valuable
Would you like to listen to some music I wrote? ;)|i would, but i dont have time for that. The curse of being successful, your time becomes your single most valuable thing
Do you have tinnitus, and if so, do you think it affects the sounds you produce?|Nope. 50 and my ears are clear as a bell because i recognized at a very early age that they were my #1 possession in the world and i have protected them as such. Tinnitus is not a forgone conclusion it is the result of your actions, so protect yourself, and if you have it now, protect from getting worse.
Do you get the physical Gold Records to put on your wall? Or only the singers get them?|we have to buy them usually but yes i get them. IG: KenLewisProducer one of the plaque walls is in there somewhere
How does it feel being a badass?|exhausted all the time, but doing music, so usually pretty happy.
Any big names you passed on that you now regret?|i ALMOST passed up working on ""We Are Young"". John Janick called me and twisted my arm (not really, by the time someone like him calls, you start taking shit really damn seriously and i woke up to at least HIM thinking this was important. sure was. I was just overworked at the time and didn't need the money, had never heard of FUN, but between Jeff and John i took it, thank GOD!!!!!! i have barely missed so many big projects, either song gets left off, or work gets left off, happens more than the big credits come thru i bet.
Tell us about once upon a time in shaolin? How does it sound?|a lot like album 2. its a fucking great record and i hope the fans get to hear it someday. Bill Murray is legally entitled to steal it, so hope remains
Why does the majority of the music sound so alike, you couldn't pick them out of a lineup much less be able to distinctly name many without already knowing who does what songs?|you clearly haven't been listening to my productions.
 |Listen to:
 |Harlor ""Not Ready To Go""
 |Skrizzly Adams ""28""
 |Des Rocs ""Let Me Live Let Me Die""
 |Future ""Blood Sweat Tears""
 |X Ambassadors ""Skin""
 |all are very different productions. I produce music and artists, not styles
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Just following up here to let you know that I have started listening to these, but not quite done yet (almost there!) Harlor, I could see getting radio play, but to me it has a kind of saccharine ""generality"" where I would recognize the song but it wouldn't really stand out for me. Skizzly Adams, ""28"" gave me a Steve Earle-meets-Jason Boland vibe which is enjoyable to me. I clicked through to some of their other music and found Resurrect Me to have lyrics in a Paul Thorn-vein (to the point that I'd like to hear HIM do an acoustic version of it.) That being said, it was good enough that I clicked through to listen to a few more tracks. First impression of Des Rocs is AC/DC meets Mojo Nixon. In the right mood, I could be listening to this. ""Used To The Darkness"" has a new-age Brit-rock feel to it. ""Maybe, I"" seems more my speed overall. ""Blood Sweat Tears"" has a catchy beat, solid lyrics, good production overall. For me, it sounds like too much Autotune (which I know a lot of people don't mind or even like, just not my thing). I can see him having a decent chance at a performance future though, the video was definitely a few steps above a lot of the rap/reggae crap spewing out these days. I'd personally give him a further chance by listening to more tracks. For X Amassadors, ""Skin"" really wasn't my thing, but I clicked through to ""Renegades"" and found both the song and especially the video uplifting. It could also be that I have trained in places that have had not only a near-blind lifter, but we had the first Special Olympics weightlifting team in the region based in our gym. Saw first hand not only how much they worked, but how much energy and joy they brought to everyone around them. Music definitely needs more exposure there. Thank you for passing on all the suggestions to me. I always enjoy finding new artists.|thanks for checking them all out, i appreciate that! The artists most definitely do too
What’s your best tip for making vocals sound amazing on a track? I’m trying to record my own stuff but I cannot figure out how to make vocals crisp and full for the life of me. Not to mention my compression is always off. Thanks!|watch Mixing Night!!!
Are the artists you've worked with as nice as they seem off camera?|some. many. some get caught in the hype for a while
Thanks for doing this AMA! as an aspiring artist, what are some words of advice for getting your stuff heard? Any ""secrets"" or not very well known things artist should be doing to help build a platform?|make sure you have fire before approaching the people you want to change your life. expect a ""No"" or to be ignored. if you do this with enough genuineness and repetition, someone will connect and you'll get opportunities
Do you have any tips for entering a ""flow"" state creatively when mixing?|try my sprint mixing drills at my school, www.AudioSchoolOnline.com the sprints train your instincts, your instincts are what you need to be in that flow state
Such fun! Do you like hearing mixes of your mixes?|hellz yes. i am long past agonizing over finished work. I've become known as a finisher in the industry and my gut tells me when its done, or my client does, and ive done all i can do at that point, time to enjoy the results!!!
[deleted]|nope sorry
Is there any artist or genre you'd refuse to work with/ on ?|hate music. i like money but i dont need money
Why do you think it's okay to ruin music as an art form in our current society? Do you feel any guilt over this?|i hope you find happiness. It must suck to be so miserable that you dont even like music. This pandemic has taken a toll
Do you have any memories or notes from ""Lord Knows"" (Take Care, Drake) that are worth sharing? Love that song passionately.|Lord Knows i got stories on that song. Here's a gem for you. the same core of the choir i used on Lord Knows, I also used on the J Cole Born Sinner album, as well as songs for Kanye, Khalil Fong, Skrizzly Adams, and Popcaan. the Blessed Choir led by Alvin Fields is my studio choir.
I don’t know if this OP is still answering questions on this thread but here we go. Do you have any tips for someone who wants to get into music, or someone who is just beginning?|watch my Mixing Night broadcasts on Youtube. Seriously, nobody else is doing what i'm doing, and I'm doing it completely free just as a big fuck you to the universe for foisting a pandemic upon us. you'll learn a lot :-)
Do you think the music you help create is objectively garbage?|Nope. try to find some happiness. This is the music industry, even on shitty days i get to wake up and make or otherwise work on music, for a living. I think the garbage is a 9 to 5 cubicle when you could have this
Hi Ken, will you help me produce a modern version of the Battle Hymn of the Republic?|will you pay me lots of money? this is my job.
What is it that you enjoy about producing? Especially given that you’ve done other roles throughout your career.|it pulls all of my talents together under one roof. for instance, being a world class mixer gives me skill sets most other producers dont possess to manipulate the sounds i hear while i produce, long before the mix. And my musicianship and vocal experience allow me to shape songs musically in a way that not all producers can do either. Production pulls it all into one. Now the coolest production projects are the cross genre ones that also pull on that experience. still, i'm middle of the pack for successful producers. Doing pretty well, not crushing it, a few bullets in the chamber right now that could break out, but its still an every day grind
Hello Ken! Thank you for taking the time to do the AmA. In your experience, working closely with so many artists, what would you say is the one thing that major artists do to get better at their craft every day? Especially hip hop artists, in terms of lyricism, flow, delivery, and so on. I know that is a very general question but as an aspiring hip hop artist, I often find myself lost as to what exactly I should be doing to improving. Sometimes it feels like I'm just making random efforts in every direction. I understand if you don't have the time to reply but I appreciate it all the same. Take care and be safe in 2021!|experience life, educate yourself, read books, find inspiration where other people dont notice. write about it constantly
Hey, I hope it’s not too late. Is it even possible nowadays to become a popular band/singer if you have no right connections and no idea how to start working with someone big? There are so many people who sing good, go to shows like X factor, endlessly sing everywhere they can, but what’s wrong?|its like professional sports. Everybody wants to play, very very few people are good enough to make the cut. same with the music industry. Honestly, if you are worried that you want to be an artist but you dont have the drive and determination for it, you probably dont. I still work 7 days a week and I'm not even trying to be famous :-) this shit is a slog thru the mud, very few people make it, but some will.
Hi Ken, your work is outstanding! Can I ask a serious question about auto tune? How many “artists “ sing so bad that they NEED auto tune?|the thing most people dont realize is that autotune is simply a tool. When i comp vocals i listen thru autotune so i can hear the emotion of the performance but in tune. If you took the autotune off my vocal comp's usually they would be pitchy mess and you would have never chosen those lines without hearing them in good tune. I do this with great singers as well as bad singers because delivering a great vocal performance has more to do with the emotional impact than the perfect pitch. you an fix the pitch, its tough to fix emotion.
You've been in the industry for quite some time, what would you say the difference is between the artists who make it and the artists who don't?|Assuming equal talent, the ability to connect with people in a genuine way. musically or otherwise. many artists are so in their heads that they cant make sound rational decisions about their own careers. The ones who make the fewest stupid decisions and can stay out of their heads usually have the best shot. it takes a great team to break an artist, and its really the artists job to make sure the team gives a shit"
mg22xr,1,2021-03-29,University and Bootcamp questions,LaunchNinja,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mg22xr/university_and_bootcamp_questions/,"Hello, I'm a CS student in community college right now, set to transfer this fall. I've been weighing the options between transferring to a university with little to no financial aid (besides loans, of course) and coding bootcamps. I consider myself a fairly competent student, I find most of theoretical CS pretty interesting and I've done some extracurriculars, but I haven't had an internship, and the pandemic has really flattened the passion I use to have for coding with other people. CS just isn't something I can live and breathe.

After reading through this sub I have come to what I believe is the general consensus:

* both a bachelor's in CS and real-world experience are necessary to make it in the industry
* There are countless coding bootcamps now, and many of them are not adequate
* The entry-level job market is flooded with grads from said bootcamps, making it hard to get a job now especially on bootcamp experience alone, even with their guarantees and promises

My goal is just to find something that pays decently as quickly as possible. I want to finish my degree and I really don't want to pile on debt that I won't be able pay off in 5 or even more years. I know that's pretty wishful thinking and there's no yellow brick road, but I would greatly appreciate any advice in this area. Am I mistaken somewhere? Are there reputable bootcamps that you'd recommend?"

I don’t know what I’m getting myself into and whether or not I can handle it and do the work expected of me. Im about a semester away from graduating with a 4 year ABET Mfg. Tech. degree. 


Generally, what can I expect for my first internship and job as far as what info they expect me to know and tasks they expect me to do?"
mg2vvz,1,2021-03-29,Can I get into grad school? (dropped classes due to depression),Countess_Calculus,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/mg2vvz/can_i_get_into_grad_school_dropped_classes_due_to/,"I'm a computer science undergrad at a top 10 CS program, and if I'm able to, I would really like to attend grad school. Main reason being, I love learning and researching far more than doing or making. Most industry jobs seem uninteresting compared to the prospect of researching and/or teaching. I have a 3.5 GPA and a couple of software development internships under my belt.

The problem is, that for most of my undergraduate career, I have had untreated or undertreated severe depression, and as such, I've dropped classes many semesters, and the semesters I haven't dropped, I've taken 9-13 credits. My depression is now being treated and I genuinely can see myself fully recovering within the next year. There was also one semester I didn't take any classes because I got run over by a bus.

I'm in my 5th year at undergrad. I plan to graduate this fall (5.5 years total). If I do some research in the summer and fall, and get a good score on the GRE do you think I could I could get into grad school?

Or alternatively, do you think I could get into grad school after a year or two in the industry? It might be helpful to hone my discipline and resilience beforehand.

**SAT:** 1540 (780 english 760 math)

**GPA and Rank:** 4.2 w (my school doesn't rank or send unweighted GPAs)

**Coursework:** My school doesn't offer APs freshman year and only offers 1 for sophomore year. Most of the APs also have a lot of pre-requisites that make it difficult to take the class. I've taken or will be taking just about every business-related elective class that my school offers.

Sophomore- APUSH (5)

Junior- AP Lang, AP Calc AB, and AP Mandarin

Senior- planning on taking AP Macro, AP Lit, and AP Stat

**Awards:**

Will be earning my Girl Scout Gold Award (creating a lesson plan about anaphylaxis that will be used in the local school system)

Girl Scout Leadership Torch Award

Girl Scout Service to Community Award

Girl Scout Service to Girl Scouts Award

High School Gymnastics Award (chosen for at large team from local conference meet)

Most Improved Varsity Award

Athlete of the month

**Extracurriculars:**

**Varsity High School Gymnastics (will most likely be captain next year)** \- **4 years**, I will earn my varsity letter every year in high school. I also manage the team's social media and represent the team at Principal's Council. I've basically been acting as captain this year since this year's captains have other commitments most of the time.

**Girl Scouts** \- **4 years,** will earn my Gold Award soon (80+ hours of work) and have won many awards from Girl Scouts.

**Yearbook** \- **3 years (will most likely be editor-in-chief)**, I am currently a section editor for the yearbook and I actively attend the meetings and volunteer to complete many pages. I check on the progress of the book and reach out to members if pages need to be completed. My advisor says I am a huge asset to the club, so hopefully I will be editor-in-chief.

**Food Allergy Research &amp; Education Teen Advisory Group - 3 years,** I write articles about food allergies that are published on the organization's website.

**Director of Marketing for a non-profit - 2 years,** I promote the non-profit on different social media platforms. We've been able to organize donations of thousands of books through my marketing and we have also raised over $1,000 through promoting our organization.

**Running a math club for Girl Scouts - 1 year,** I was only able to run this math club for one year due to the pandemic, but the club focused on encouraging Girl Scouts to enjoy math through fun games and activities. The club had mostly 1st and 2nd graders. Hopefully I will be able to help with the club again!

**Principal's Council- 2 years,** I represent my gymnastics team in the Principal's council meetings. We meet monthly and discuss the school and make suggestions on how to improve it.

**Video Production Club** \- **3 years,** I film and edit videos of school events to be streamed on Youtube or on the morning announcements. Unfortunately, due to COVID, there are very few events to be filmed. I probably will not run for an exec board position for this club.

**AV - 2 years,** this isn't necessarily a club, since you have to be asked to do it, but I do the lighting and sound for school events and get paid by the school. This year, we have not had any events due to the pandemic, so I haven't been able to work an event.

**Club Gymnastics - 4 years,** I go to club gymnastics about 6 hours a week for practice, but I no longer compete (apart from high school gymnastics).

**National Honors Society- 2 years,** I am a member of NHS and will be inducted this year but I do not plan on running for an exec board position.

**Job- 2 years,** I work at a manufacturer and pick up calls, file, help customers, and manage the sales tax.

**Volunteering- 4 years,** I am a member of the local youth council and have volunteered every school year.

**Prospective**

**Internship -** I'm trying to get a summer business internship at a local company for some business EC.

**Letters of Rec and Essays-** They'll be strong. I'll be asking teachers I have a good relationship with and possibly my hs coach for a supplemental letter of recommendation.

**Schools:**

I want to intern at a game studio to learn how studios are ran. I always had an idea for a game but felt I needed a solid pathway to get there. I coded several websites on my own in javascript and learned how to drawn digitally. I never coded a game, but I've worked on GDD documents on my own time. I'm currently taking classes (so far I only know python) for my major in computer science. I've read books on game design but lack an experience in a company. How would I find an internship to help teach me how some people manage game projects, work with a diverse team and run a game studio. If somebody could give me meaningful advice on how I could get this kind of experience, that would be great. Thank you in advance."
mg3ix2,0,2021-03-29,I regret not attending a bootcamp in 2015-2016,medium_rare91,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mg3ix2/i_regret_not_attending_a_bootcamp_in_20152016/,"For some background, I graduated with a business admin degree in 2015 and went back for my MS in computer science in 2017, graduating in 2019.  Part of me wanted to do a programming bootcamp before grad school to get a head start on the job market, but I thought school was best for me at the time.




2017-2019 was pretty great for me in terms of the job market.  I had no problems getting an internship or full time job offer as a career changer.  I ended up choosing between a data science job offer and software engineering offer, both at big companies, but not necessarily top tech companies.  I decided to go for data science.



However, at 2 years of experience, the pandemic kind of destroyed the job market for data science, making it hard to job hop.  I work with senior software engineers who went the bootcamp route early on in 2014-2015 and they are all very happy with their decisions.



I definitely feel like I wasted two years getting my MS and two years working a low paying job before grad school.  I regret not getting into CS when it was getting popular."

mg40h1,1,2021-03-29,"I think my employer/ CEO tried scamming me, what should I do?",binblazen,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/mg40h1/i_think_my_employer_ceo_tried_scamming_me_what/,"I've been working at an unpaid internship for the past month, and I think they tried to scam me.(I didn't sign a contract to work for them, so I'm not sure if I count as an employee). 

The company has an office in New York, but I'm currently working from Texas

I typed up the messages below, but I also have photos if anyone would like to see them.

I got an email last Friday stating -

**(Boss) -** I need you to reply with your cell#. I need a task done ASAP and look forward to my text.              I responded on Sunday night with my phone number.

Here is my conversation with him the next morning.

My responses will be in bold and \_\_\_ is my name so ignore that

Hi \_\_\_ I need to know if you are available at the moment. I'm in a closed-door conference very soon, but let me know if you get my text. (7:00 AM)

**I'm available rn. (8:00 AM)**

I need you to get a task done ASAP

I was invited to a special local author event that includes talks by bestselling authors. I'm about to make a presentation in a few and I need some google cards, I need you to locate a close-by store and that out for me.

How soon can you get this done \_\_\_?

**I'll see what I can do**

**\_\_\_** can you get this done ASAP?

**What is a google card exactly?**

TBH I don't really know much about it but I know you can get it at a close-by store and you can try online and get it sent to my email address \_\_\_

**I'm still not sure what a google card is because when I googled it all I got were google play gift cards**

Yeah \_\_\_ that's it

Can you get this for me \_\_\_ I just need you to give me an extra hand right now

I will appreciate you helping me \_\_\_.

**Sorry, but I'm a college student without any earning so I can't purchase things without my parent's approval**

How much can you afford at the moment?

**0 since I don't have any money myself but why are you asking me?** *(I actually asked why me but I just woke up so I didn't type it properly*)

Nevermind

He stopped texting me at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterward, I was very suspicious of a few factors -

\- Could he not have bought the Google play store gift cards on Friday when he asked me for a favor. In fact, he still had time because he wasn't yet in the meeting at 7:00 AM when he first sent me the text

\- I'm an intern, so if he truly needed money wouldn't he have asked a genuine employee or retrieved money from the company.

\- Why would you need Google Play Store gift cards at a local author event

\- He also made the task appear to be very urgent (something that is done very commonly by phone scammers)

\- (This is speculation, but the special event sounds fabricated)

This was one of those internships that you pay for, so I lost money to ""work here"". BTW you pay an internship group not the company so the company doesn't actually have my money. I wanted help in regards to -

&amp;#x200B;

1. Could I just resign tomorrow since I never signed a contract with them?
2. Could I get my money back from the internship group, and if so how?
3. Is there a case for me to demand money from the company since he is the CEO and I'm irate at the company and is that a good decision (I don't want to bring it to court, but what are the odds they will settle the situation outside of court)?"
mg43uh,1,2021-03-29,1-year Developer Internship in Analytics vs Full-time Bioinformatics Developer?,ycrow12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mg43uh/1year_developer_internship_in_analytics_vs/,"Hi all, I'm looking for some advice/opinions if this choice seems obvious to those experienced in this area. I have a degree in Biochemistry from a while back and am finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science soon. My only tech-related intern experience has been in the IT sector for 2 years, however I would like to move into development or analytics of some kind.

 I have the option of simply delaying my graduation in order to take a 1 year internship at a fairly well known tech company in Canada. From what I've heard it's overall a great company and I get experience with technology that I would like to work with going forward. 

The alternative is that I may have a full-time offer soon in an academic/hospital research lab supporting their development of pipelines/software/web-apps. The compensation I'm expecting to be roughly even. I'm leaning towards the Internship as it may provide a better learning opportunity for someone without any real dev experience. I feel that also transitioning from software dev to bioinformatics later would be easier (as long as I keep up to date with the field. Which I enjoy doing). 

Would it be crazy to take an internship over a potential full-time offer? Would the title of intern hold me back in the future? I feel that perhaps dev experience at a tech company might be more valuable than experience in academia, would this be accurate?

 Delaying graduation makes no difference to me, I have a degree and all my courses for the computer science nearly completed. It's more of an administrative difference for me in that regards.

Thank you all,"

mg4uhv,3,2021-03-29,"My boss from former unpaid internship keeps contacting me, I have resigned but how I can I make it clear that I do not want to hear from them again?",Discussion-Jaded,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/mg4uhv/my_boss_from_former_unpaid_internship_keeps/,"So this is a unique situation I feel- but I’m studying a masters degree and took an unpaid marketing internship to build some experience (no college credit-not essential for my course). However the position became very consuming, people were contacting me at all hours of the day  and the position became a greater responsibility than advertised and too much whilst I am studying
However the weird situation here that is the startup is ran by women in their mid twenties  and as we are all a similar age,  I built a friendship with the MD but she is a very clingy person and had me on 5 hours worth of calls everyday etc. whilst I like this person, she contacts me 24/7,rings me all of the time and also consistently contacts me regarding the company, expects me to chase people for content etc. When I said I wanted to leave, I used my masters as the reason and claimed I wanted to dedicate my time to it. However she seems convinced I am coming back after May and it’s just at a point where messaging this person is causing me anxiety, making me want to avoid using my phone and feel unable to relax. Thing is this girl is also going through a hard time in her personal life and she has really advocated for me and been a good friend to me in many ways. But I can’t deal with this constant messaging especially regarding this unpaid internship. I don’t feel like I owe them anything , they weren’t compensating me in any way, I did not sign a contract and I have made it perfectly clear (I mean I literally resigned) that I don’t want any part of this.
I don’t know how I can phase this any clearer without being rude or ghosting messages. I don’t want any sour relationships and want to keep things professional, however if I stop responding I leave them in the dark  and make myself look a bit shit but I simply can not deal with this any more, it feels like borderline harassment. How can I word this politely?"

Any advice or feedback is welcomed!!

About a year ago I received my Bachelors Degree majoring in Computer Science. My degree solely focused on coding, which was kind of a bummer since I thought I'd be able to take some IT classes as well. Although, I did enjoy taking coding classes. While in my Junior year in college, I attended a few college fairs and that definitely helped out on getting an internship, which is where I'm at now and what my current ""situation"" is. The Internship that I was hired on for and that I'm still currently in focused on IT Security, which over time I definitely grew a passion for and I've had the opportunity to learn quite a bit. So, the ""situation"" that I'm in is that I've been at this internship for over 2 years now and over time I was able to lead my own projects and tackle different tasks as well, but sadly I have been unable to get hired on therefore that has now lead me into looking for an IT related full-time job (whether that's security or something else) for several months now with no luck. With that being said, here is a small list of my experience that I've learned throughout my Internship:   


Carbon Black Protection, Lansweeper, SIEM, Cylance, AD, KnowBe4, vulnerability management, working on security related incidents with end-users whether technical or non-technical, auditing.  


Also, up until about last month I decided to hit the books again and study up to take the CompTIA Security+ certification in which I passed. This lead me to hope that I'd be able hopefully land a job soon (which I am still in the search of).   


With all that being said, I think the interviews I've had have gone great, I'm just starting to think that it's maybe that lack of experience within IT? Or maybe I need to work on my resume? Is there anything else I could do to stand out as a candidate whether I'm applying for a HelpDesk position or a Security related position??   


PLEASE HELP!"

mg5nap,1,2021-03-29,Management Consulting -&gt; Tech career,cupafeel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mg5nap/management_consulting_tech_career/,"Hi everyone, I am looking for advice on how to switch over to a career in tech (PM, BA) given my current situation. 

I joined a reputable but boutique management consulting firm back in October after losing my return offer before graduating due to Covid and I needed to pay the bills. Prior to that, I had an internship at a major investment manager as a quant/research where did a mix of financial research &amp; software development. I also had an investment analyst internship at a hedge fund where I did some VBA scripting, and a business strategy internship at a consumer software startup.

I have a minor in CS and a double honors in econ/finance from a top Canadian school. I have working experience with python, SQL, and flask, and have course knowledge in react, javascript, java, c++, and c. The only project I have is a really bad honors thesis involving machine learning and 3 mini projects I did for a graduate-level machine learning course.

I would like to switch over to a comparable pay CS career by this year as I don't want to get too deep into my firm's specialized industries (mining, oil &amp; gas, manufacturing). What else could I do to make my profile better (bootcamps/projects/etc) and more qualified for a PM/BA role?"

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

I think its important to contextualize your extracurriculars from where you live because my surrounding area had practically 0 STEM opportunities. Most of my activities were either started by me or I had to really really search for them ( excluding debate and YAG). I fought for a HOSA chapter, science olympiad, quiz bowl, biology olympiad etc. but ultimately my school was really unwilling to take any of those programs on and I knew as soon as I had left, they would essentially die. There are so many more things I wish I could have done and competed in but unfortunately, I simply didn't have access to them or learned about them too late. I did the best I could with what I had and I think that's what helped me get in.

1. Founder and president of a community based organization (have been running it for 7 years) that has received recognition from local/statewide media outlets and state representatives in Congress. Primarily works to solve achievement gap in scientific/financial literacy in food deserts, has launched several regional science fairs, and has helped over 5,000 disadvantaged kids get into STEM educational programs.
2. Youth and Government- Lots of state awards, including distinguished delegate x4 and was ranked pretty consistently as the top delegate in the state. The policies I wrote actually saw some implementation on a local level, which was cool.
3. Medical research on diabetic ketoacidosis and the development of different treating methods. Presented at annual physician conference and work was published. Also was a co author on several medical case studies.
4. Speech and Debate- Lots of state qualifications for three different circuits, NIETOC qualifier, NSDA nationals 3x qualifier (advanced to semis pretty consistently but never broke after that). Also grew local debate teams, helped run tournaments, and lobbied for increased speech education
5. President of Hospital Volunteer Organization- ran operations for over 300 volunteers, mentored new volunteers, expanded shadowing programs, partnered with local farmers markets with 2,000+ attendees, held medical leadership seminars, and had 400+ hours of pretty standard community service.
6. Wrote and published a biology book to help students engage in biology in a less intimidating manner. I translated it into English and Spanish as well. I also wrote a couple children's books in Yoruba and Swahili with bilingual translation in English and helped distribute them through book drives with international nonprofits.
7. Photography- Did free photoshoots for local nonprofits to aid their efforts, raised 6,000 dollars, held cultural education exhibits with my photography pieces, and had some private exhibits as well at local art centers and museums.
8. Environmental Internship- Conducted a study that viewed the impact of native vs nonnative plants on economic sustainability and biodiversity in an urban landscape. Created and planned urban gardens with native plants with local nonprofits helping the homeless. (it was ongoing during the application process so I put it here because it was recent). 
9. UNICEF Chapter President- Partnered with local businesses to raise money, held fundraising trivia nights, did book drives/other donations, and awareness events
10. Academic Leadership- grouped all my national honor societies I had leadership positions in like NHS president, SNHS President, and NAHS VP

**Awards/Honors**

*Definitely my weakest section*

1. *NSDA All American Debate*
2. 2x *State Champion in a Gov. Competition (can't say the name without doxxing myself lol)*
3. 5 Gold Keys for Photography
4. National Merit Semifinalist
5. 3x  Academic Science Region Champion (taking a science test lol)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Research professor- 9/10 He said I was the most promising student researcher he had seen and compared me to a couple undergrads at Stanford and Penn who worked with him

AP Lang Teacher- 10/10 She said I was the best student she had ever taught and also my favorite teacher. She often consulted me about my endeavors and accomplishments so they had a really good understanding of my character and passion.

Honors Bio teacher- 7/10  Generally, a good writer. Also said I was one of their best students but because they were my freshman teacher, they were not particularly in tune with all my goals and endeavors

**Interviews**

Harvard- great interview. Interviewer was from my area and knew of the very little opportunity so that probably helped. Also mentioned I was one of the top applicants they reviewed. It was my first interview but it was really transparent and insightful.

Princeton- Probably my best interview. Really connected through art, science, and public policy.

UPenn- a close second to Princeton for the same reasons.

MIT interview- pretty bad. I realized half way through the interview that MIT was really not the right fit for me.

Yale- My interviewer showed up late. Pretty neutral tbh. very close to the deadline of submitting interviews  because it was mid March. Connected through passion for language. Honestly, it felt more like an info session about Yale.

**Essays**

Common App personal statement had a ton of revisions. It centered around my passion for art and science. Probably an 8-9/10

H Supplement- After admitted, my regional AO specifically brought up this essay in addition to my extracurriculars as to why they accepted me. It talked about a ""powerful experience"" (what the AO described it as) I went through that ultimately bolstered my community activism.

**Decisions (**

*Acceptances:*

* Harvard University REA (waiting on virtual visitas to decide)
* Johns Hopkins $160,000 scholarship (given that I maintain a 3.0 GPA) RD
* Vanderbilt ( Got in early through Mosaic and the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship) RD
* UC Berkeley (notified early for regents) RD
* Emory (Woodruff Scholars finalist) RD
* UCLA RD
* UCSD RD
* UT Austin - got accepted in  november
* Temple University- rolling admissions

*Waitlists:*

* UChicago - RD
* Northeastern - RD

*Rejections:*

* MIT- RD (I can't really blame them)

**Waiting on: (**This does not include any likely letters because it still technically isn't official)

Upenn, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Yale, Dartmouth (I think I am an auto reject cause my counselor did not submit my mid year report on time), Princeton, Duke, and Stanford

&amp;#x200B;

I have no expectations for the remainder of my schools, but I hope I can at least get accepted to three of them. I cannot bring myself to commit to a school without at least going to their admitted students thing."

It's a small company and they like to see progress quick. 

First few weeks was just me doing tutorials and pretending to look busy. I do have an assignment, but in order to do that assignment, i need to understand the framework, a framework that i've never used in college or in my life before. The tutorials make sense, but the tutorials assume from scratch. I was given a huge project with multiple files and multiple directories. It's like a maze going through each and every file, trying to understand what the code does. So trying to integrate the tutorials with this huge project, is causing me to hit my head. 

Problem is, i am 1 out of 4 programmers. We all work on different languages/projects, which makes it hard getting help from my coworkers. I was hired to replace the person who was actually working on the project, unfortunately they are not here for me to ask him questions. Sometimes i go the whole day without talking to anyone. I'm just left alone to my own devices. I can't imagine them wanting to keep me after my trial is over. I feel like it's my fault, but then I read other people's stories who are clueless, but they work at bigger companies and can get away with not showing much progress after 2 months."

I received internship offers this week with Tradeweb (Tech Internship) and Walmart Global Tech (SWE Internship), and I need some advice on which one I should choose.

Tradeweb: it is a mid-size financial service company based in NY and NJ. I will work for Data Platform Team in NJ office, which is about ML, infrastructural tooling, and visualization. Fintech seems really cool to me as it may open doors to working in finance and bank. They also pay me higher than Walmart ($35/h vs $23/h). They are planning to be on-site but they are not 100% sure. Finally, the interview process is smooth, and my recruiter is really responsive to my questions, especially after I receive the offer.

Walmart: The biggest downside is that it is still vague. The only thing I know is that I will be assigned an individual business project with a mentor and be reported to e-commerce team. I heard that we will work from front-end, ML/AI, data up to site maintenance. The advantages are its brand-name and SWE-related internship, which may give me more opportunities to big tech. Also, it is a remote internship.

I want to be a software engineering but it seems both contribute to my career. I'm a junior so this is my last internship, and I am leaning toward an option that can grant me a full-time role as it will save much stress looking for jobs next year.

The title is pure satire and as sarcastic as it can be. If you do read what I wrote, you will see my experience is rather: How I got in *despite* being a girl.

I don't.. expect to post this to have my ""life"" deconstructed into arguments you can debunk. You can make whatever you want of what I'm about to say, but **please stay respectful.**

It's a \[very\] long post, but I hope it helps bring a new perspective to some. I guess I'll add some TLDR at the bottom for the normal people that won't read the freaking essay-length post I wrote. I got a bit carried away, sorry :v

\*\*\*

I started playing with computers when I was 3 or 4. Apparently, my parents were impressed with how quickly I understood how to get around user interfaces, but it might've just been something that any young kid fiddling around the computer at that age could figure out.

Y'all, you don't know how often I begged my parents for ""magnetix"" construction toys (but got [this](http://www.richardmanvillestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ELLO_PLAYSET.jpg) instead), hot wheels (but got a barbie RC car), etc. Honorable mention to what my parents gave me when I asked for a skateboard bc [it's fucking hilarious](https://pixl.varagesale.com/http://s3.amazonaws.com/hopshop-image-store-production/28559490/aa7ed5364ab0f3b16be47c60cc8fe9ab.jpg?_ver=large_uploader_thumbnail&amp;w=640&amp;h=640&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=06af8d05bb404641b4c6042e3fb77816).

During my teenage years, I started getting into things like animation with Flash Player (rip Flash) and generally became a lot more knowledgeable than my friends at knowing how computers work, but I learnt that sharing that passion with my female counterparts would often be met with ""meh""s, as opposed to if I'd gotten into makeup art or drawing. For a while, my guy friends actually liked it when I told them about programming ""games"" in excel(!!), but that was until everyone started wanting to date each other, and suddenly my hobbies were seen as ""not feminine"" - wanting to fit in, I eventually just took to keeping these things to myself.

My parents occasionally praised that I was ""really good at computers"", but that was about it. Where I came to get really mad was when my cousin (who was my age) came to stay at our house for the summer, and my parents sent him to science camp while I was sent to art camp (I wasn't asked which I'd prefer).

By the time I was 16 and was looking for a summer job, I knew my way really, really well around computers and really enjoyed this, so when one of my friends told me that his work was looking for someone to work at the computer sales department, I was ecstatic and went to interview. I was asked veery general knowledge questions about computer parts/electronics, and I immediately answered correctly to every single one of them. I was immediately hired on the spot for that position.

Working there, I didn't really understand why people kept asking me ""*honey, how do you know all this stuff about computers?"",* ""*did your dad teach you all of this?*"", and, my favourite, ""*would you mind if I got a second opinion on this from your colleague over there?"".* Said colleague who often shared shifts with me, often came to work high and his knowledge was so limited about all the products and warranties, that his hesitance when he was called over for a ""second opinion"" made me lose a sale more than once. I asked my friend (who got me the job) if he often was asked for ""second opinions"" during a sale, and he looked pretty confused - he told me I must ""sound shy"" when doing a sales speech. I was super passionate about computers, and clients who didn't ""doubt"" me would often tell me that they adored my service.

Oh, yeah, also at that job, still 16, I was sent constant creepy texts about ""my boobs looking hot in my uniform"" by my 29 year old manager. I also found out that he did the same thing to a 15 year old cashier. We were all too scared to call him out, and I don't know what happened to him, but I doubt anyone called him out on it. 

The best part about that job, is that despite me ranking first or second in sales, more than once the ""rumor had it"" that I was only hired because ""a girl hadn't worked there in a while"". Fun fact: out of everyone that worked with me, I'm the only one that pursued studies in CS or anything related, but hell it couldn't be possible that I did well in the interview.

When I was graduating high school and told my dad and stepmom that I wanted to study engineering, my stepmom told me that ""I had too soft of a character for that field"", whatever that meant. That was not the only reason why I didn't go into it, but it certainly didn't help with doubting if I had what it took. So I studied something in humanities instead, and unsurprisingly was miserable and envious of the kids in my college who were studying STEM. During that time, I still worked at my college's computer lab, and of course I was the only girl there. I just got used to the fact that, probably for a big part of my life, I would be the only girl in things related to computers.

I finally started studying in STEM, and was so freaking happy and got the best grades I'd ever gotten. But there were a few things in and outside of class that always left me a bit uncomfortable.

My math professor, who I really liked, during a class about 3D integration, explaining how ""girls in the class would probably not be as good at these, since everyone knew they were not naturally good at spacial awareness"". The irony being that we continue to give girls barbies and boys legoes, and wonder why things like this are said.

My hardware team, in which I was the only girl, joking about making me the ""secretary"" of the team. Eventually, when the captain of said team asked me out and I explained I was gay, he flat out stopped inviting me to the final reunions of the competition, and I didn't get to finalize the prototype. I did attend the competition, only to be extremely awkwarded out because the others thought that I had bailed out on the team in the last minute.

Another CS club (only girl there too), where we went out for drinks and I was the only one who was given a ""BJ shot"" in the table (it's an alcoholic drink that's made to make you look like you're giving... you get the point), paid for by the captain (not the same guy as the hardware club). I felt super awkwarded out by this, but being scared about what had happened in the other club, I just shut up and drank it. A comment was passed about how ""I looked like I knew what I was doing"". The whole night I was constantly asked about my personal sex life with my girlfriend, and the comments got more and more invasive as the night went on.

I got a scholarship and did some research internships at the beginning of my bachelor's. My boss in one of my industrial internships was and is to this date the most supportive guy ever, and he set the standards on what treatment to expect from superiors. It's after working for him that I realized how over the years, my input on things were *not* given the same consideration as my male coworkers. \]

In quite numerous occasions, and this still happens, I will have an idea I just gave ""reexplained"" to me by a male counterpart. If you're a guy: I very much understand you are trying to be nice, and you're not less my friend if you do [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201603/the-psychology-mansplaining), but it does get annoying overtime.

Last year, I started looking for internships for this summer. Did my CV get read quicker because I'm a girl? Maybe. But my CV is so filled with tons of projects, internships, awards and scholarships, that 5 out of the 7 places I applied to (yes, I only applied to 7 places, including 3 FAANG and the rest being pretty much below FAANG), hit me up. (Fun fact: amazon did *not* get back to me!). I am pleased to say I will be an SWE intern for one of the two hardest FAANG's to get into.

I dare you to tell me that I only got in there because I'm there to fill up a statistic.

I end this by saying, I am aware some of the things I got that I sound like I'm complaining about, like the toys, the art camp, not doing the major I should've done right away, I'm still very privileged to have had. I am still extremely grateful to my loving parents, and I don't blame them for anything, I know this is more of a societal problem.

If I sound extremely frustrated despite where I ended up, it's because this journey was f\*king frustrating when it shouldn't have been, simply from the attitude about women in those environments.  And as much as this is a personal story, and I probably went trough a particularly shit time because I got involved in a gazillion CS activities and clubs and jobs, talking with other female friends in my field, we *all* have *multiple* stories like these.

So if you're wondering why a company would need to put in extra measures to try to get women to apply, go read those statistics, think about stories like the one I just told you, and maybe all of that will help you understand why while women's participation in CS was going up in the first 20 years of the field (+1%/year from 1970 to 1985), the number of women crashed dramatically for the next 30 years after that (-0.5% year from 1985 to 2015).

We do not want to be treated ""better"" than men in the field, but we also do not want to be treated worse, and this has been the case until now, which is why you can't get that many women in the field. Nobody is saying that workplaces need to have a sharp 50/50 representation of women, but all we ask for is to be *treated* equally. Until then, companies can maybe try to encourage us a little bit by giving a second glance to our CV.

That was my story. Now, who wants a BJ shot??? :-)

TLDR: considering the *shit* (understatement) I went through because I was a girl interested in compsci among a sea of men, the least companies and colleges can do to make me *stay* in computer science at all is give my resume a second look.

Edit: I did not expect people this many people would respond!!! The amount of positive comments sending love AND the incredibly constructive and healthy conversation that is stemming from this post, gah it makes me so happy y'all don't understand. I don't expect everyone to agree with every word, but even those who are literally just acknowledging the shitty parts without being for AA, this is more than what I could ask for. 

If you're one of those peeps with the negative comments, I didn't forget about you!! I got you a little gift to try to make up for all the wasted time you spent saying negative things on this post.

I’ve been thing about bringing together a group of students to work on projects together as a small way to band together, help each other, work on impactful projects, and learn useful skills as a small way to combat these predatory unpaid internships.

I've been interviewing for internships for the last months. I recently received an offer and also accepted it. (would love to take a look at other potential offers, but couldn't wait due to offer deadline)

There are still a couple of other companies where I am in the interview process, and I'm wondering if I should cancel all scheduled interviews, or just continue with their processes and decline potential offers (in case I receive one).

Pro Continuing:

\- it's a perfect practice for future interviews

\- interviews are excellent opportunities to learn about the companies and get insights from engineers working there (while I can't join for the internship anymore, I'm still of course interested in full-time positions later)

\- it's also interesting to see how their interview process and a potential offer would look like

\- if I do well in the interviews (i.e., receive an offer as well), it might be easier to get invited to interviews for full-time positions later

Con:

\- if do bad in their interviews they might not invite me again for a full-time application

\- rejecting an offer could also make me unpopular at that company

\- I would be somewhat wasting their time

What do you think?"

mgdo1r,5,2021-03-30,Is money worth being miserable for?,CornflowerFieldmouse,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mgdo1r/is_money_worth_being_miserable_for/,"I currently run the mailroom for the company I work for, and I'm making 52k a year right now. I'm also only two years out of college, so that's an amazing amount of money to be making, especially since I still live with my parents because they want me to be able to save up as much as I can.

I honestly hate my job right now though. I'm so bored in what I do. Every day is the exact same thing, and right now, I dont see a chance of moving to a different position anytime soon, because there are no open positions. I've been in this position for the past year, and prior to this I was in another position where I enjoyed the work (when I actually had work to do), but the hours were absolutely torturous to me (I am very much not a third shift person) because the vast majority of my time i ended up watching tv since there was literally nothing for me to do in terms of work. I had jumped at the chance for the position I'm in now because it meant I'd be working during the day and getting a decent amount of sleep at night, instead of watching tv all night at work, getting maybe four hours of sleep during the day if I was lucky, and then crying every single time I had to get ready for work because I was so tired and hated just sitting there all night watching tv with nothing to do.

I'm at the point now where I hate having to go to work every day, with every fiber of my being. I have to get up before six to get my train so I'll be at work by eight. I do the exact same thing every single day, with the only differences being the exact time I do my tasks, because obviously they're based on when mail is delivered. Every couple of months someone is complaining to my boss about me, and it's either something I have no control over (like not having given them a piece of mail they're expecting, which I cant given them because it hasn't been delivered to our office yet), an outright lie (like claiming I posted things on social media that are derogatory to people I work with), or is just petty (like complaining that I'm not outgoing enough).

I think the root of the problem is that work doesn't challenge or mentally stimulate me. I did a double major in college because I was bored of the low classload with only one major. I took 6-7 classes a semester for most of college on top of being a teaching assistant, working as a tutor, being involved in 3-5 clubs, doing an independent research project in junior year, preparing for a collegiate conference both junior and senior years, and also doing a part time internship during senior year. I did all of that, and graduated only 0.01 away from magna cum laude, at a school that uses an ivy league grading scale.

I know it sounds arrogant to say this, but the evidence I just presented supports it, so I'll say it. I'm smart. I know I'm smart, and I used to hate it growing up because as a kid I had no friends because of it. After all, it's hard to make friends when you're seven and want to discuss politics because you find it fascinating, but other kids look at you weird because they dont even know that there was just a presidential election. Because I'm smart though, I need to be interested in what I'm doing in order to not be miserable at work. I need to be challenged by my work, but im not right now.

I'm in EMT class on the side right now too though, to be a volunteer EMT. I'm finally getting to fulfill a dream I've had since I was a kid, and I absolutely love it. I'm finding that the field of emergency medicine is challenging and fascinating. Plus there's the fact that EMS lets me help people, which is the only goal I've had, quite literally, ever since I was five years old and decided that someday i wanted to be one of the people who runs towards bad things in order to help others. I truly think i would love working paid 911 EMS, because no two days are ever the same when you dont know how many calls you're going to get or what type of calls they will be. Plus, in EMS, yes you have protocols to follow, but you still have to think critically to figure out how to best move the patient so you can treat them, or how to best treat them. The only thing that doesn't appeal to me if I were to change careers to paid EMS is that the pay is pretty low. I know several people who only just make around 45k a year, and that's only through doing as much overtime as they possibly can.

I tried talking to my parents about my dilemma, and both pretty much said I'd be stupid to throw away my 52k a year with a set schedule for raises job for one where I'd be making around 35k a year with no overtime and honestly not many raises are given in that field, but I could always go back to school to become a nurse or PA, and they do make a lot of money.

My problem is though that I dont see why making 52k a year is worth it when I'm miserable for the majority of the time I'm awake. Sure, I'd be making a lot less in paid EMS, but I'd also be a lot happier than I am now.

My mom always told me growing up that if you get a job doing what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. Well, I have a job doing something that makes me miserable, and I hate myself every day because of it. I dont know what to do though, because like I said at the top, I still live with my parents, and I wouldnt be able to afford a place to live and a car on my own, so I'm wary of getting them too mad at me."

Feeling very behind /:,cokezeroaddict27,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mghx4b/what_are_skills_i_need_to_work_on_to_be_ready_for/,I am a sophomore in college however I started CS a semester late and had no prior knowledge about anything CS related. I went through the interview process for a FAANG and got pretty far into the interview process (I have a good resume in terms of leadership and involvement and may be considered more “outgoing” than the typical CS Major. The company was also looking to hire more women so that may be why I got pretty far) however once the interviews got more technical I quickly learned that I am probably not ready for an internship in this field... I am wondering what skills are important for me to know and have in order to feel more comfortable with the internship process next year? (For example: I was asked about databases and have honestly never learned about or worked with any databases) And also should I be worried at all about not having an internship until after my junior year?

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. **Counselor**: (3/10) just repeated my resume, spelled my name wrong every time, but didn't say anything bad. Very generic, nothing special.
2. **Writing, yearbook, journalism teacher**: (10/10) Said TWICE that I was the best student she ever had, mentioned my parent's divorce and how I overcame it through writing, touched on my passion for politics and social justice.
3. **US History teacher and debate advisor**: (8/10) Said that I taught her more than she taught me, mentioned using my work as an example, said a bunch of stuff about debate. More generic than my other one though.

**Interviews**

I interviewed for Reed, Lewis and Clark, and Georgetown.

1. **Reed:** My best interview by far- we really connected and it was a very lighthearted conversation rather than an interview per se. I mentioned a bunch of reasons why I wanted to attend and we both talked about Reed's cheese club ahahah.
2. **Lewis and Clark:** went well, safety school so nothing crazy, more to learn about the school than anything
3. **Georgetown:** went okay. It was my first interview and I was very anxious (I also have general anxiety and social anxiety so it was a bit difficult :/ ). We both connected about our passion for the environment but otherwise, it was very interview like and she just asked questions straight from my resume :(

**Essays**

I'm not even going to rate these because of how bad they were. My essays were probably some of the worst writing the admissions offices had ever read/seen.

**Personal statement:** I wrote my common app essay on January 5th in two hours and never revised it or looked at it after that. I wrote about my fear of the unknown and how my time spent hiking and exploring off-trail helped me concur that fear in the context of debate. Very rushed, cliche themes, and way too much unnecessary descriptive language. My 8th-grade brother could have written a better essay if you would have given him time. If I could rate it, it would be (at minimum) a -5/10

**Supplements:** Somehow even worse than my personal statement. I wrote ALL of my supplements the day of each college's deadline and some were written AFTER the deadline at 2:00 am - 4:00 am in the morning. Very cliche, rushed, and just obviously not a lot of care put into them (duh- I wrote them in the middle of the night after the deadline lmao).

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

\*I applied to all my schools RD because I missed my early deadlines hahaha (oops- depression is a bitch)\*

*Acceptances:*

* Georgetown University (attending!!!)
* Middlebury College
* University of Oregon
* Lewis and Clark College
* Willamette University
* American University

*Waitlists:*

* George Washington University??? (did not accept spot)
* Carleton College (did not accept spot)
* Colorado College (did not accept spot)
* Claremont Mckenna College (accepted spot)
* Reed College- my dream school :/ (accepted spot)

*Rejections:*

* Bowdoin College
* Amherst College
* Swarthmore College
* Pomona College

**Additional Information:**

I submitted all of my applications but two (George Washington and Bowdoin) late. Some I turned in a couple of hours late, others days late, and some weeks late. I even submitted Georgetown and Middlebury late. I also wrote all of my supplements after the deadlines (except in the two cases mentioned above) and never edited any of my writing. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder back in November and really struggled throughout the application season. I didn't even start my applications until January and thought I would never get in anywhere. I was so happy to get into my safties and couldn't even imagine two months ago having choices of where to go.

If anything, this is proof that things work out eventually. If you would have told me back in my sleep-deprived writing sessions after MISSING my deadlines in January that I would be going to Georgetown, I would have laughed at you.

For any juniors or other high school students reading this- I hope things work out and wish you luck on your own college endeavors. As I mentioned in the beginning of my post, I can't believe I'm done with this process. Maybe I'm just overly sentimental, but it's very bittersweet and I'm excited to see where life takes me. Again, good luck to all of you high school juniors about to head into this process :) 

All in all, I'm very happy with how things turned out. I wish I got into more selective liberal arts schools besides Middlebury since I much prefer that environment over a large school like Georgetown (and still feel an urge to go to Middlebury over Georgetown)- but I obviously didn't put in a lot of effort on my applications and deserve my rejections 100%. If anything, I wish I applied to more schools and obviously put more effort into writing essays. I was in a really low place in November and January though and I’m proud to have even made it to this point. 

I'm super excited and feel very privileged to be attending Georgetown though and D.C. is SUCH a dream for a pol sci/government major like me. Hopefully, the next four years treat me better than the last four. It’s been quite the ride and I’m happy it’s finally over.

2. My job at a dental office- I worked at a dental office over summer of 2020 full time, mainly put this to show I had interest in dentistry
3. Granite State Challenge/Quiz Bowl- was team captain last year, our school team qualified to be on tv for the first time in about a decade which was cool
4. Entrepreneurship Program- I did this program last year in Boston where I formed a startup idea w/ other high schoolers, we got an award but did not place lol. I also did an internship over the summer with them at the same time as when I worked in the dental office.
5. Model UN- I'm the club president; but our school's club is pretty new, so nothing too big there
6. Math Team- did it for all four years and I'm the team captain this year
7. Robotics program (different than #1 lol)- I did a 12-week program with BAE Systems and built a robot w/ 3 other people

10. Debate Club- I am the VP and used to be the secretary

4. Commended Finalist for National Merit Scholarship
5. Overall excellence in English award- don't know how I got this lol, another school award

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Gov/Philosophy teacher - 10/10, he really liked me and I still talk to him even though I don't have him as a teacher. He actually showed me the letter (I didn't see it through common app) and I almost cried reading it. I was probably one of the best students in his classes and he was really rooting for me.

Honors Pre-calc teacher- probably a 7/10, she liked me as a student too, though not as much as my AP Gov teacher. She's also the math team adviser so hopefully that helped.

**Interviews**

VCU- It went really well, they actually asked me interesting questions about my interest in dentistry which was great.

CWRU PPSP- They just asked me ""tell me about yourself"" and if I had any questions about the dental school. Kind of concerned about that.

CWRU Undergrad (optional)- It went really well, my interviewer and I clicked and they asked some interesting questions

UPenn- My interviewer seemed like they wanted to rush things for some reason? But overall, it was okay

MIT- My interviewer was really weird and kept on talking about how he likes to do interviews to know all the different people who exist in the world? Was kinda weirded out by him lol.

Rice- It went for about an hour, so that was a good sign. My interviewer also had some experience in bioengineering so that was cool.

NSU Dental- It went pretty well, discussed why I wanted to do dentistry and some leadership experiences

NSU Presidential- This one went super well, probably my best interview I've done. My interviewer and I really clicked and had a great discussion.

NSU Razor's Edge Programs- These one's were ROUGH lol. They had some really hard questions that I literally could not answer lol.

Cornell (interview not considered for admission)- This wasn't really an interview, they just wanted to know more about me and what questions I had about Cornell.

**Essays**

My common app essay was about my identity struggle between being Indian and American and how I reconciled the two. This one was probably my best essay, I worked on it all summer before senior year.

My supplemental were not the best, I kind of procrastinated on them and reused essays wherever I could. Should not have done that.

I really want to end up programming at a game company one day, that's the goal anyways. I want to make myself stand out as I'm hoping next summer to get an internship at a game company. I'm wondering what kinds of things I can work on to continue improving and increase my chances of even getting an interview. Currently I know a bit about C/C++, Java, Python, next semester I'll be taking 3D Game Programming, Linear Algebra, Data Structures, and a course on the principles of Software Design (how to work on larger projects in groups, how to manage them, good and bad practices, etc.), and the semester afterwards I plan to take AI Programming, Operating Systems, Advanced 3D Game Programming, and Security in Computing. I plan to keep working in C++ and learn more of it so I can become very proficient in it, for instance my final project this semester I can choose any language between C/C++ and Java and I'm going to do C++. I've done a bit of work in Unreal Engine, I know how to build a scene with landscape tools/materials (not a pretty scene, I'm no artist), post process effects, how to build landscape materials and paint, etc., though I haven't messed with coding in Unreal as my professors have told me that the C++ there is different and I should become really good at C++ on it's own before I move on to programming C++ in Unreal. I know I have a lot to learn, and that over the coming year I will be learning a lot more, I just also feel like I could be doing more. Any suggestions?"

Should I report this to them or is this ok as long as they secured it otherwise? The Accounts seemed to be fairly important (something like Admin\_NOC).

I would like to see what your opinions are on my chances of getting into [UCLA](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/university-of-california-los-angeles/136), USC, UChicago, Harvard, Stanford, UMich, Oxford, CAL, and Duke for their master’s program in Computer Science. As well as where I can improve my application when I apply this upcoming fall?

I am a third-year at the University of Iowa majoring in Computer Science and Engineering and minoring in Business Administration. My degree is very close to a double major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering as I would be only 4 courses away from attaining it. Although, I have decided to pursue a minor in Business instead. My cumulative GPA is 3.2 overall. Although, I have gotten an average of an A- in all of my computer science courses. The electrical engineering courses are what have hurt my GPA. I do know my GPA is not great. Besides my GPA, I will have two internships completed by the time I apply. One was with a start-up company in the Bay Area and this upcoming summer will be with a Fortune 500 company as a Software Engineering Intern. As well as I am working with a Professor on implementing Machine Learning onto an autonomous boat. This is not a research position but one where I am working with a professor instead.

What are the odds of potentially getting it? Do I have a reasonable profile? Also, I have not taken the GRE yet but will be taking it soon.

I graduated in 2018 and found a job as a data engineer working at a tech consulting company. While I loved the company, the role was really unhealthy for my career for a number of reasons: 

1. It was the first job I had in data engineering and I felt out of my depth for most of it
2. We were frequently moving from project to project so I was constantly forced to learn new tools and move on before I every went deep into one.
3. I have ADHD, so my mind works sort of the opposite of the workflow stated above and so trying to keep up with the 2 week sprints was giving me a lot of anxiety and I felt like I was slipping further and further.
4. I never really gained an interest or passion for the work. I felt the satisfaction of doing a good job on occasion, but never really liked the subject, though I'm not sure if that was just because of the points above.

Last November, just over two years after I started there, I quit the position and my manager agreed that was a good decision. I fell into a lot of bad and unproductive habits until maybe late February  when I sought help from a life coach who specializes in my disorder, and that has really helped. Now I'm at a point where I feel like I should return to the workforce pretty soon, but I just don't feel that passion for it that I used to. I feel like I should refresh my skills, but lately I've felt an aversion to doing that and I don't know if that's just a result of the bad experience I had with my last job or if my interests are changing. So my question is, what is a good place to start, in order to:

1. re-kindle that passion/figure out if I even still like tech anymore
2. find topics in tech I might be interested in learning
3. re-learn skills that I might be rusty at so as tp set myself up for success when I do decide to look for work again.

I'm also curious if any of you have experienced something similar and how you responded to it. This turned into a much more lengthy post than I originally intended, but I felt it was important to give some context."

In walks a lady in her fifties. I would soon learn that this was going to be my first of many encounters with Karens.

€me is me, €boss is boss, €user is aforementioned karen


€user: ""You, boy, I need you to refill my Wi-Fi.""

€me after pausing for a brief moment: ""*Refill* your Wi-Fi, ma'am?""

€user: ""Yes you heard me, stop slacking and do it.""

€me, being very puzzled at this point: ""Ma'am, in order to assist you to the best of my ability I am going to have to ask some questions. Does your printer phone or pc experience issues connecting to your Wi-Fi? Do you mean you need printer ink? Is your WiFi slow?""

€boss: ""Ma'am, I know many things in the tech industry but I, nor any other store know what you mean by 'refilling Wi-Fi'.""

She then left in a huff and never returned. I guess we'll never know what she meant.

only got admitted into a local safety/target that I don’t particularly like (guess I’ll have to like it then...lol) it hurts so much knowing that I could’ve still ended up there even if i didn’t push myself as much these past four years. extracurriculars, leadership positions, internships, sacrificing myself to take difficult classes and earn good grades (psa: don’t take more than you can handle; don’t be like me. although I learned a lot taking these classes, it doesn’t look like it was worth it at all right now.)

I haven’t gotten into a single university since December, when I received an EA acceptance. At that time, I brushed it off. I told my mom, “don’t celebrate too much, there’s more coming later in March!”

and there wasn’t.

I always thought I would be like the kids in the college decision videos, jumping up and down when I realized I finally got admitted into a top choice school. 

but that didn’t happen. 

I am emotionally drained right now on a sunny Tuesday afternoon, lying on the floor while listening to the bright cheers of children at the nearby park.

I hope this isn’t too depressing (who am I kidding, it is). yeah it’s a typical “woe is me post”. But it’s also a reality check to keep your ego in line. I grew up in a prestige-obsessed community. high achievers. I remember freshman year where my friends quietly judged where people were going to college through Instagram bios. in sophomore year, I loaded myself with difficult APs, pretending I was better than my other classmates. “yeah I’m studying on a Friday night after waking up from a nap of depression. So fun!” I remember scrolling through my social media feeds, wondering where people were getting the time to hang out with people or go to parties. I was bitter, but I thought it made me better than others - because I was sacrificing my humanity for the sake of college. 

It came tumbling down in junior year. I couldn’t do it. I was burnt out and depressed and sad and I eventually got a C in a class. A black stain on a report card of meager attempts to overachieve.

Despite this, I still thought I was better. Better than those who didn’t “challenge” themselves enough to take the classes I was. “Your schedule is insane,” people would tell me. It was. I was. I thought I still had shots at top schools. I am probably the kid who peaked in middle school and tumbled down after it. It was like everyone passed me while I stood there with only my ego growing.

And I realized that I was average. The same as everyone else. Not subpar, not extraordinary - although I tried to convince myself I was, because of my internships and passion projects. 

Only recently have i been able to find the old, happy person I once was again. I’m learning to enjoy the little things in life and balancing out my schoolwork, earning good grades, and finally becoming happy. 

I have no idea if any of this makes sense. Basically I am saying that it’s not worth to sacrifice your entire mental health for school. I hope there is a payoff one day. But right now, looking back on my seemingly endless string of rejections and waitlists, I feel so defeated. It SUCKS admitting mediocrity. But yeah here I am, saying “I’m average and it’s ok” in front of many successful, amazing people whom I hope I do not know in real life. That would be awkward if I do. And I also hope to find happiness at whatever college i end up, even if freshman look at my IG bio one day and scoff.

I've been working as a software engineering intern for the past 4.5 months and, frankly, I hate it. I had another software engineering internship back in university and I also did not like it. I thought I could stick this one out for 6 months (my contract doesn't have any end date) and see how I really feel by then but I honestly think my feelings will not change. 

I don't enjoy the work at all. I wish I could just autopilot and get through my day but everything is so frustrating to figure out and I have to give it my all even though I have no interest or willpower. The thought of my projects and tasks makes me feel so defeated. Talking to my boss or his boss really stresses me out since I feel like they're constantly disappointed in me and my performance (they have told me they are). I don't enjoy programming. I don't enjoy thinking and talking about tech all the time (or at all anymore). I don't enjoy the engineering culture. I'm definitely not performing well at all anymore and most days I don't even want to get out of bed. A lot of my old depressive habits are coming back too and last night some of my own thoughts scared me. (I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon so no worries there I guess).

I want to quit. I have a 15k savings, no debt, and a family who will support me financially so I'm not worried about the money. But I feel like I'm so directionless that if I quit I'll just waste away the years staying unemployed or working odd jobs until I'm like 30 and even more lost. I've been thinking I could quit and spend some time working a casual part time job, volunteering, and immersing in my hobbies until I get myself back together again and then try another for another career I might enjoy but I don't even know what I can do. None of my interest really align with the career path I'm on. I started learning a bit about ux design but even if I do enjoy it and learn about it, it wouldn't be for another year until I could try to look for a job I think since I have to learn and make a portfolio.

I know the typical advice is to wait until you get another job to quit but I burst into tears in front of my coworker yesterday after a pretty stressful interaction with my boss. She was chill about it but I'm starting to think I'm reaching the end of my rope. I have cried about work and how I feel in this career but never in front of others and definitely not at the office. I'm not the type to cry in front of others. My coworker has sort of become a ""mentor"" to me in my time here though and she asked me ""You're not getting paid a lot, your family also doesn't need the money, and you're not happy here. What are you doing here?"". I don't even know. I'm scared of not having a career. I don't want to stress my family out. I don't even know what else I would do with my life.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?"

To my surprise, I was just accepted into the Software Engineering class of 2026-- it was my second choice to CS, which, from reading [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/2jkijj/differences_between_software_engineering_and/) [after](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/2jkijj/differences_between_software_engineering_and/clcl2mm/) [article](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/future-undergraduate-students/comparing-bse-bcs), I think is a bit of a better fit for me: I really like the openness and flexibility that everything I've read about CS implies.

However, if I don't get into CS, I'd probably be happy with SE. 

Except: My math skills are... okay. Since I'm not Canadian, I can't compare my classes with Canadian ones, like Functions/Advanced Functions ([someone said it's called pre-calc in the US, which I took](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/9k9lqz/what_is_the_american_math_course_equivalent_to/))

I've taken Calculus, and, while I love it, my algebra skills are definitely not up to par. It takes me far too long to simplify, and I get it wrong about as much as I get it right. Not great.

If I had to guess, I was admitted to SE because I have a ton of programming experience-- I did a college software engineering internship in high school (without providing too many details, it's very safe to say I earned it), and I've written a few full-stack apps used by hundreds, not to mention tens of fun side projects. Alongside that, I have considerable IT experience: I manage a small company's IT for work and have done school IT for four years. (I'm sorry if this seems braggy, I just want to make sure you have the full picture)

As I took a look at the math requirements for SE, I'm definitely worried. Should I wait for the CS decision? Or consider going somewhere else? Maybe take a bunch of math this summer? I need some advice."

I chose law bc my parents graduated in law school and my dad is very successful, I won't lie I have ""dreamt"" of being a lawyer or judge almost my entire life, it is a cool job indeed but the university sucks, this whole process sucks, it's even worse with the pandemic 

at 17, on my last year of high school I was between law and psychology, it was where the shit started, I should've stuck to what my heart wanted since the beginning, but I decided the ""easy"" way, also my older brother is a drug addicted so he's all wrong in life, he started and dropped law school and did the same with psychology, that's why I think my parents thought I was joking when I said I wanted to go to psychology school, since they found out about my brothers addiction everything he touches is doomed, he has been going to psychiatrist and psychologists his entire life and it has never helped, my parents even tend to blame those professionals bc my brother only got worse. 

I brought it up again last year, the first pandemic semestre bc it was when I saw clearly for the first time that I did the wrong choice, my parents laughed at me and said I would change my mind bc university isn't all flowers, ok. 

today I decided I had enough of this shit, I thought my dad would help me find an intership or something since he is successful BUT we moved cities in 2019, precisely bc of his work, it happens that he knows nobody in this new town, he found me an internship last year's March but I had to drop it bc I couldn't manage to work and attend classes, bc the university in this new city is waaay harder than the one I was before so I failed in some subjects, anyway the pandemic came I got ""depressed"" idk what happened, my brain gets foggy when I think about last year but since august/2020 I've been looking for an intership to fulfill my credits and I can't find one, I get interviewed, I do the tests, everything right and no one calls me because 1) someone has to recomend you (I knew that from the beginning and I thought my dad could help, I didn't know we would move somewhere he didn't have any contacts) 2) you need experience,  but I can't have experience if no one is willing to TEACH ME, HOW THE FUCK AM I GONNA KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH LAWYERS SYSTEM IF NO LAWYER WANTS TO HELP? university doesn't teach this, life doesn't teach this and I can't learn it from a YouTube tutorial bc you need special access to access the fucking system

FINE, I was right about not having an intership bc I dont need one to get graduated,  I mean it's not mandatory, I decided to stick with the practical classes and it was OK, I would finish this shitty law school and immediately start psychology school, I would talk to my dad if he could afford it, I was ok with getting graduated at 28 if it was my second degree, UNTIL I find out that I still need those credits, I have no fucking idea of how im going to get those credits.

and now I'm crying my eyes out bc I'm feeling like a failure, I hate uni, I hate myself of 17 years old, I hate it so much, I don't want to be a burden to my parents, I don't to be 30 and still have them paying everything for me. I know where the mistake started, I should've focused on technical courses when I was 15, I should've thought seriously about uni when i was 17 and more than anything I should've done a good job in my classes when I was 18 and 19, but instead I was living like a stupid teenager,  in school I was worried about boyfriends, one direction, getting drunk and being thin, on my first years of uni I was worried about making friends, enjoying my time as an academic and know life is eating my ass. I hate not having experience, I hate that my parents didn't have money to send me on that exchange I always wanted bc MAYBE I would have a chance, I hate to be wasting my time 

I'm so done of it and I'm not going to drop bc I'm not like my brother, bc my dad pays a hell lot of money on this shit for me to throw it away, I can't stand being 20 and being trapped inside my house not only bc of covid (I'm Brazilian) but bc I'm unemployed with no perspective of finding a job even the lowest one, bc I simply have no experience,  not even a BAR would hire me, what am I going to do? I HAD the plan of getting married at 28 but how am I gonna get married if my dad still pays for my food? if I don't have a job bc I'm fucking incompetent 

oh my God I wish I could dissappear or start all over again, I wish I had my 20 mind when I was 15."

As such, I realized the reseach I'd be doing for my university in May is incredibly relevant to this robot; the software I write could easily be ported to a more commercial invention. 

My question is, what are the ethical boundaries of this? Does the university have ""IP""? Is research done in the lab to stay in the lab? I know in the situation of working for a company, and using its facilities without a contract to create a product for another is a legal minefield, but I have no idea where the lines are drawn when it comes to academia. I don't want to put myself in a bad position (and certainly not burn my prof) because of this, any advice on the do's and don't's on what's okay?"

* AP/IB: for some reason, I did not send AP scores?? I had 4s and 5s on everything but I was just so tired of doing things after submitting my apps that I did not do it :(
* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): N/A

**Extracurriculars/Activities:**

* My main 'standout' ECs (ranked 1 and 3 on my CA list) are super confusing and unconventional and prob would expose me. Idk if u rlly wanna know you can PM me. I didn't feel I had enough room to fully explain them w my 150 characters, but I tried my best and wrote as many essays as I could about them :). They were internships related to my major and pretty kickass if I may say so myself. (10-12)
* Leadership position (11-12th) (literally my only leadership position lol) in a major related club (participant 9-12). I really didn't go for a ton of leadership in HS bc I was dumb and wasn't thinking about college apps until the end of jr year. also idk I think American culture/capitalism is obsessed w the idea of leadership and I more so enjoy being a middle of the road person &amp; focusing on my interpersonal relationships
* A sport: listed a bunch of awards I got from it some were state and 1 national. (9-12)
* Instrument - took up a fair amount of my time/brain space. Listed a bunch of low-level performance awards I got. (9-12)
* Internship for a local politician: just normal phone banking and dealing w campaign finances stuff. Would recommend for my fellow sufferers of phone anxiety as a growth experience (11)
* Worked at a daycare - my absolute FAVORITE thing I did. honestly, I did a lot of my other activities out of obligation and because I didn't know what else to do with myself.  The kids are all adorable and it was probably the only EC of mine where I truly had fun doing. (9-12)
* Fundraising as part of a club. Honestly, I felt weird and white savior-y (even tho I'm not white lol)  about doing this, especially since we did it through a Christian sponsor who donated to the global south and wasn't super culturally inclusive. I ended up quitting the club after 10th grade. I was so conflicted about whether to include it or not bc we raised a lot of money for education :/ . (9-10)
* normal volunteering stuff - last 2 slots could have lowkey been left out but I did spend a fair amount of time on them and thought what the heck I'll put them down. local orgs where I didn't have leadership but put in a good amount of hours. (12) &amp; (9-12)

**Awards/Honors:** bye this section was so lame. I put NHS and NMF down cuz I didn't know what else to put + a local character award

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:**

No idea but I generally like writing. I love the idea that people are just a collection of stories and I don't think I wrote a single supplement that wasn't anecdote-heavy. Were they good? I don't know, but I had a ton of fun writing them either way. They were all quirky, or put a spin on conventional topics in some way and I had a lot of fun tying weird or interesting experiences that I've had into meaningful ideas. Honestly, I thought I came across as a bit robot-y in the rest of my app so I tried to write essays that humanized me and showed that I have a personality through humor or writing style. Def pretty try-hard.

Just a reminder to any juniors that this sub &amp; a2c esp are amazing so plz use them! There were several AOs on a2c around the time of the icebergchick scandal when shit hit the fan who offered to read my PS! Their positive feedback gave me a huge confidence boost and made me less neurotic lol

* Waitlists, Rejections:
   * NONE (SHOOK me to the core y'all)

**Additional Information:**

Wow, when I write it all out it's kinda overwhelming and I'm super proud of myself.  I pretty much solely had money on my mind going into this and tried not to apply to places that I knew I wouldn't be able to justify paying more than my in-state tuition at + a few dream schools. All in all, I think the most important part of this process is self-awareness. It will save you from unrealistic expectations and disappointment but also it's helpful in the writing process to be as objective (as possible!) and know your skill level and know when to ask for help and how to accept it graciously :)"

I looked sexy as hell, and *professional* as all hell. I had on the outfit I wore to interview for my current company: Deceptively short black skirt that flattered my hips and legs. A nice black jacket and white shirt underneath with a hint of cleavage that could always be… adjusted as needed. A small black purse I got on sale for the few essentials I didn’t feel like magicking out of thin air. Professional heels that made sharp clacks on the steps and tile floor with every step. Hose that looked great but I could still strategically rip for a broom closet quickie in a second’s notice. World Famous and Patented 'Fast-Drying Witch-Quick' black nail polish I had applied just before I went out the apartment door to complement the jacket and heels. Subdued, but classy red lipstick that was easy to clean off a lover's skin or clothing. And of course, scandalous black lingerie I had Charlie choose for me from my closet, not that anyone could see it yet. *I’ll need to hide my lingerie collection when Anne flies in, along with the porn and sexual health Witch Pharma products.*

I felt sexy, brave, confident, and poised as I willingly walked into SIA like the biggest fool on earth. *Focus on their what’s happening in their pants, imagine them in their underwear, and you won’t have a panic attack in the worst place for a Succubus to have so much as a sandwich.* I could see at least eight people dressed in suits like Agents keeping their eyes on me, and only half seemed aroused. Which sucked.

Charlie pretended not to stare at my ass as they followed behind me in their awkward sweat pants and fancy lab-coat combo, waving to the occasional employee milling around. I walked up to the first of three secretaries I saw available at the front desk and cleared my throat. “Hi, Miss… Charlene? Agent John Isaacs called and said he needed to see me within the hour? I’m Lillian Smith, I’m a…” *Terrifying and alluring Succubus ready to rock your world and fulfill every naughty fantasy you’ve gotten from those erotic novels you binge at night. Please don’t press a panic button?* “-consultant is what he called it, I guess. Can you tell him Charlie’s with me as well, and we’re at the SIA lobby?”

The middle aged Charlene looked me over giving off a painful spike of jealousy and a depressing lack of interest. *Straight women... Hurts every time.* “I’ll see what I can do.” She lifted the desk phone and tapped a flurry of numbers before talking quickly in a low voice.

“You sure know how to make an entrance,*”* Charlie mused from beside me. “I might become the most popular elf here after today. So, thanks.” *How many elves worked here? How many* people *worked in this SIA building anyway? Thousands?*

“Well, I wish I had entrance *music*,” I whispered back. “And Isaacs waiting here to assure me everything’s fine.” *As much as I hate to admit it, he's my lifeline now.* I noted a few of the Nerds from the morning in the cafeteria were in a corner discussing something over coffee, and some kept their eyes on me.

“He says he’ll send someone down for you,*”* Charlene said with the phone to her ear as she pointed over to some empty seats near the door. “And for Charlie to stick with you for the time being. So please take a seat for the time being.” Charlie, for their part, pouted adorably. I thanked the woman and exuded confidence as I walked over to my seat, and *not* the sanity-breaking terror I was actually feeling.

This part of the SIA building felt more like a public train station than a secretive government facility tasked with crushing supernatural threats to the nation. There were obvious civilians milling around, and several agents. I could see a food shop with signs detailing exotic and species-specific foods available, several paperwork windows with bored attendants, and a tacky gift shop. I took a moment to people watch amidst all the natural activity. A nine foot grey troll nearby was scratching his head over some paperwork being explained to him by an Agent, a vampire was twirling a black umbrella and tittering with a human over a travel magazine. A infant witch in a stroller waved to me, so I waved back and made a silly face, then relaxed back to normal before their mother discovered me. It seemed like a normal day for these people doing business with SIA. I was glad humans had decided to build, well, *this* for managing us supernatural beings, instead of the overt dystopian horrors they constantly dreamed up in books and film.

Meanwhile, my brain was in overdrive. *They probably have cameras trained on me, and guns, and gas vents for anti-demon gas, demon-grade acid jets aimed at my face, flamethrowers that would actually work on me, and missiles, nuclear warheads and-*

My worrying was interrupted when a Wood Elf ran over to Charlie from the specialty food shop, wearing a similar lab coat and stirring coffee with a pleasant smell and color I couldn’t easily describe. “Hi Charlie, didn’t see you at the morning meeting with Doctor Stevens so I had figured you were sick leaving. What have you been up to?” It took less than a second for me to desperately want her. *I'll flirt with this girl at the drop of a hat. Thick thighs, dreamy eyes, and a cute wood elf face I'd get to ride all night.*

Charlie rolled their eyes and yawned. “Field work and babysitting related to a case some New Yorker Agents dropped in for.” *Oh Charlie, you little shit. You better not use me as a conversation piece right now.*

The Wood Elf’s eyes went wide and she grew excited. “Really, that Demon case? I heard they stumbled into one and captured her but she wasn't *actually* related to what they were here for initially. A *Succubus*, no less. Evening Groups have been in a tizzy but won’t tell me anything about it.” She sighed, long ears flicking rapid-fire up and down, showing visible annoyance at the situation. “I even did that ‘cross my heart and hope to die’ thing humans like doing to beg the secret from them.” Wood Elves had sexual dimorphism you could tell at a glance unlike the Northern European ones, but they had other oddities. From what I remembered talking with Jen at work, Wood Elves had excellent illusion magic, unnatural balance, perfectly graceful movement, and shyness that could be cultural. Also, Wood Elves had thick, adorable Canadian accents, at least those that made their way to Chicago and knew English. This one didn’t seem to have American idioms down yet, and it just made her so cute I wanted to… well, I didn’t want to get ahead of myself.

“Yeah, I met the Succubus early this morning. Cray. Zee. Shit. I tell you.” Charlie said before jerking their thumb at me. ""So anyway, Lillian’s here to maybe work with us, depending on how helpful she is.""

“I guess that’s my cue to introduce myself?” I asked nervously, looking between the two of them. *Maybe I can defuse the situation before she freaks out.* “I’m Lillian, by the way. I love your necklace.” I offered a hand, and the woman shook it earnestly and professionally. Her necklace had little ceramic beads and leaves painted a moss green, surrounding a three-headed owl with intricately detailed feathers.

“Ah, I’m Desha’nya-thak’k, but everyone here calls me Desha,” the Wood Elf introduced herself. “And thank you for your complement about my necklace. If you’re interviewing, I wish you good luck, as I was striding in your shoes only months earlier.” She looked over my outfit and something clearly made her curious, because she did another quick once-over. ""I’m sorry, but were you raised amongst humans? I’m somewhat new here to this nation and all the customs are difficult to remember, but you seem more... aware, I guess, of how human cities work. I never would have remembered a purse must match the jacket.”

I nodded and leapt at the opening she gave me. “Yes, I've lived in human society for as long as I can remember. There’s a lot to keep track of, but we get some leeway when we’re pretty.” I gave her a wink to test the waters… and… couldn't gauge her interest yet. *Dammit. If SIA employees are all this cute I’ll have to seriously debate between working here in the future, or trying to sleep with all of them, because I* really *shouldn’t do both. Although Isaacs did promise daily willing liaisons as a bonus for working with SIA… Shit, did Charlie already count for today!? Can I sneak in an evening snack too?*

Desha sighed, a little sad. “Indeed, you are very pretty and classy dressed. I’m sorry to cut off introductions Fae Lillian, but I simply must know more about the office water-gossip-cooler and the frightening night, unless I just… *I’yeesh’thi'ycka*… Charlie! When do you think we’ll get to see and study this…” She leaned forward and lowered her voice to add a semblance of secrecy in the crowded SIA lobby. “Demon, safely from a distance? I heard a year ago that Isaacs plays real quick and open with the rules. I’m crossing fingers and keeping them behind me for luck.""

Charlie crossed their arms and smirked. “Oh, that Succubus? You just shook her hand, Desha.""

The Wood Elf snapped her attention to me, practically exploded with fear, then fainted in a heap on the ground. I magicked up a plate midair to prevent Desha's coffee from spilling on her or us just in time. “You little shit!” I hissed at Charlie. *I want to throttle them, assuming they wouldn’t enjoy it. But I can't do that, because I’d signed those damn SIA contracts to not hurt SIA employees!*

Charlie burst out laughing. Which got us a lot more attention than I wanted in an SIA lobby, and I was certain every Agent in the room was watching me now.  I leaned over and tugged on Desha’s sleeves to wake her up, after retrieving her coffee from my magic midair plate. Desha stirred after a moment of my increasingly frantic sleeve tugging as Charlie kicked at her shoes calling her full elven name.

“Uh… Hi again, Desha…” The Wood Elf groggily opened her eyes and glared at Charlie before looking back to me. “Not the best introduction I’ve had, but I look forward to possibly working with you in the future?” *And fucking until we have crying orgasms, but we might have to ease into that possibility.*

“That’s a mean trick, Charlie,” Desha groused as she sat up. “Lying about a Fae interview person and scaring me. I will remember this when I prank you back in the future. It’ll be worse than the underpants fire ants gift I gave you in autumn.” Charlie blanched, and I liked Desha a little more.

“Um… Do elves like pranks?” I asked the two elves in front of me. The both said ‘yes', then ‘no', then ‘yes' again in perfect unison. Jen would sometimes do silly things in the office, which she explained increased company morale when I asked her about it. A few weeks ago I did enjoy eating the jello covering my desk stapler, but that seemed like a harmless prank. These two were on a whole different level.

“Lillian Smith!? Charlie?” An obnoxious and familiar voice called out. Lucas the pretentious vampire had arrived and was scanning the crowd for us. I grabbed my purse, coat, and gave a half-wave to Desha as I shuffled around her on the floor. I tried to wave Lucas over, but he refused to move through the lobby to meet us.

“Yeah, yeah, one second. Gotta get a new asshole torn for that prank.” Charlie waved me off before they leaned in and spoke to Desha in a voice they thought would be too low for me to notice. “But seriously, that absolutely stunning woman is a real Succubus, and she’s a researcher's Holy Grail- a *Listheen-Y’Va* to you- we never thought possible. Willingly contracted up to the eyebrows so she’s safe to socialize with as well. Isaacs has been running around creaming himself about this since last night. Even higher ups out of state are excited, and you know how boring they usually are.""

“But hasn’t Isaacs helped kill more Succubi and Incubi in the field than any-“ Desha whispered before Charlie shushed her. With that tidbit of info nearly stopping my heart, I tried not to faint on top of Desha, settling on my knees shaking a little that I covered up with an awkward cough. *I’m totally going to get vivisected if I don’t get blasted with anti-Demon acid jets piloted by anti-demon guard dog nukes marshaled by Isaacs. But it would be worth it to strangle that damn elf before they cause a panic and get me killed by all the Agents in the lobby! All for a practical joke! No wonder Charlie’s single!*

“I’ll tell you more later, but we’ve gotta go!” Charlie blew Desha a kiss and trotted me over to Lucas, pushing through the crowd. “Come on, they’re probably waiting for us.” *I wish I wasn’t bound by contracts, I’m starting to regret hitching my wagon to a guy I met at a bar last night who’s an expert on how to kill- Nope! Happy thoughts Lillian. He’s been nice so far, and they’ve promised they won’t murder me. On a contract!*

Lucas was all business, so I doubted I’d get a sympathetic ear. He looked the two of us over as he ushered us down a hallway to a waiting elevator. “I’d like to establish the following before we go any further Lillian. You are to remain within close physical contact with at least one Field SIA operative at all times while you’re in this building after we get on the elevator. For instance, me, and not Charlie. You will also not wander anywhere, and immediately obey all our orders from Agents and staff.”

“Sure, when reasonable.” I said, annoyed as the magic washed over me. *Even making a contract with Lucas gives an oily and unpleasant feeling. No wonder he was at a low-class Sup’ bar trying to score with Fae girls last night.*

“Not ‘ok when reasonable’,” Lucas grimaced and stopped just outside of the elevator. “You’re not wiggling out of this on a technicality from your interpretation of ‘reasoning'. Either yes, or no. ‘No’ means you don’t get on this elevator.” *Well,* s*omeone woke up on the wrong side of the coffin at sundown.*

“I will willingly stay within sight and within the room of at least one SIA Agent at all times here. If SIA employee orders and requests are lawful and ethical to someone like Agent John Isaacs, non-contradictory, and not uttered with sarcasm or other such facetiousness, I’ll obey them, with possible followup questions for reasonable clarification,” I replied, as a more calming feeling of magic washed over me. *Still, having to rely on Isaacs’- the guy who’s a Demon-killing machine according to that cute Wood Elf- interpretation of things is not ideal.* “That’s as good as you’ll get. Your version would let an Agent ask me to cut off Charlie’s head, then my own, and I’d be forced to do it. Even if it was said as a joke.”

“She’s got you there, boss,” Charlie snarked as they gave a self-satisfied stretch. *Not that I don’t appreciate the backup, but if you’re going to pretend we didn’t just have sex, at least try not to run around looking like you’ve broken a massive dry spell, Charlie!*

Lucas stared me down, clearly enraged. “Fine. You and Charlie follow me then. We’re heading to the evidence room.”

One long, winding trip through nondescript hallways and we walked into something that looked like a combination of a library and wacky antique shop. “Don’t touch *anything* here without asking me,” Charlie murmured as Lucas led us inside. “unless you want to get hauled into court to explain why your fingerprints are on a magical murder weapon we gathered ten years ago.”

I put my arms behind my back to remove any temptations, even though the magic of Charlie’s order already clicked for me. *There is some cool stuff collecting dust on the shelves...* “Personal experience?” I asked lightly. Lucas said nothing, but kept behind the two of us, perfectly unobtrusive except for his shadow billowing a bit on the ground in front of us. *Spooky.*

We passed by swords, yard equipment, books, photos, papers, lamps, chairs, many of which were wrapped in plastic or in bags with detailed tags. Several guns, piles of powder, bones, shimmering crystals suspended in air, and children’s toys were just some of the things I noticed lying on shelves that seemed to go on forever.

“No, some dumb college intern last year.” Charlie sighed after considering for a moment. “Had to testify on their behalf to prove their innocence. I call that kid ‘GuiltFinger’ now.” They laughed, but I wasn’t sure why it was so funny, so I figured it was elven humor again.

Isaacs and Fuller were up ahead of us, standing by a table, somewhat ruffled. On the table was a large black box. Isaacs looked up from documents he was studying as he noticed my clacking heels. Charlie and Lucas had been completely silent. “Ah, you’re all here, thank you for arriving on short notice.""

Fuller looked me over. “Why are you dressed like that, Lillian?”

“My first impression kind of sucked, but I figured I’d still dress to impress for an official gig at SIA. You like?” I did a small twirl and heel pop to show off the style. Fuller grimaced, and turned to a pile of papers in front of her.

*Some day she’ll open up to me, hopefully.* ""So what’s in the box?” I asked Isaacs. It was jet black, about two feet long on each side, and it had a magical feel much like whatever was at Tilly’s. It was hard to tell if it was the same one, especially since there was magical stuff all over the room.

Isaacs sighed. “A corpse, we think.”

mgwlts,1,2021-03-30,How do I transition from IT to construction management?,snacksonsnacks2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mgwlts/how_do_i_transition_from_it_to_construction/,"So quick summary, I graduated with an MIS degree and one good internship underneath my belt and I started a new position as an IT Data Analyst 1 month ago (power bi, sql, python, etc.) I have not liked my job in IT at all. I have worked at a grocery store for 2.5 years while going to school full time so I was really focused on just surviving and getting a job offer before graduating. Those 2.5 years seem like a blur because I was always working, going to school, and repeating the same routine. 

Well I landed a 70K job in my current city Houston before graduation with a massive company. I was glad I accomplished my goals but one month in to the job I don't think IT is for me. I don't like sitting in front of a computer all day and the work is so abstract it frustrates me. I've always been a more hands on person and I really considered construction management but I dismissed it as I only had a year of school left. I'm depressed in this job and I am realizing IT does not play to my strengths at all. All the information I am learning is boring and these massive IT projects are hell on earth to me. I don't want to move up in IT or even try. I'm far more interested in construction (res, commercial, or any really). 

My parents are immigrants and say I should just stick with the job but I don't want to. They think I have it great because I work from home and the job sounds prestigious. Any advice? I'm 23 and have no debt and over 40K saved up and very little expenses (I live with my parents)."

I haven't seen too many fall internships posted by companies. However I know there are still a lot of students who intern during the school year. For anyone who has experience interning during the school year did you apply specifically for fall/spring, or were you offered an extension from a company you interned during the summer? Did you work part-time or full-time? Did companies generally offer to extend their interns into the school year prepandemic?"

UCSD POI: He is a new professor (Joined Nov 2020), I will be in first batch of his students( This will have pros and cons, would like to know both)

Georgia tech POI: Young professor ( Joined 2015),
He is proven has quite a few industry collaborators. He has 1.5 years of industry experience (Post Ph.D.)

I feel these are the major points to consider :
1. The Ph.D. program(Amount of inter group exposure and industry collaboration).
2. Coursework
3. Internship and Placement opportunities
4. Campus Reputation and atmosphere.
5. Housing and Living
6. Weather 

Please add if there are other things to consider.
I would love to get view from someone who had any knowledge of either/both of the schools.

My intention was to work here for a year, go back to school, then see where the winds take me.

Right now all the work we do is remote, however given vaccine rollout there's a good chance there will be a full reopening by august. I'm not sure what the likelihood of me returning is, but my manager said he'll try to let me work a hybrid model (2 days in the office, 3 days at home or something like that). The office is kind of far from where I live and on a typicsl day I'd be commuting upwards to 3 hours a day. Frankly I'm not really all that keen on spending 15 hours a week driving when I can be putting that time aside doing literally anything else.

Right now I'm under contract to work here until June and my manager said he'd be happy to extend me til the end of the year if i wanted. I'm just wondering what the difference between 6 months and 12 months  at the same company &amp; position will have  on future prospects when screening my background. one big reason the commute timesink is particularly unattractive is because it's keeping me from working on some personal projects -- like a research lab I've been working in and making really good strides as of late.

I know commuting to work will become a thing in the future but I'd ideally live closer to my job once I settle down to a full time position.

So a bit about myself. I am currently studying virtually for my Masters and have received an 8 month (End of April-December and internship could be extended) internship with a really big company. The opportunity provided by that company is great since it will give me a lots of experience. 

Now the dilemma is that I will have to commute to work  by driving for an hour (total of 2 hours of driving back and forth). As 1 hour of driving is a lot. The drive is mainly going to be on highways but since I'm driving from Hamilton-Fort Eerie, I'm not expecting too much traffic during commute.

I was also considering relocating to St. Catherines which  between my current location and the work site which slashes my driving commute to 30 mins. It's important to mention since I'm an internee my hourly wage is $20/hour. I am looking for rental places (between $450-$800 as it does not financially make sense to look for something larger and considering this is just an internship).  My masters would not be impacted if I relocate. So my big question is does it financially make sense to relocate to the city 30 mins away from the work site?

I've evaluated the pros and cons of living in my current location: Pros: I currently live with my brother rent free, so all utilities paid for. Occasionally pay for some of their groceries to contribute.
Cons: 1 hour commute, wear and tear on the car. I've read studies that long hour driving can affect mental health in the long run.

Appreciate the advice!"

I feel like this FAANG culture has drowned upon me so much that I have now lost all my interest in making apps, it just feels like making apps are not worth it if I can't secure a good job. A few of my friends have got internship offer for this summer from some big giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. while I have also secured an internship opportunity from Samsung, but still, I always feel like it's not a FAANG company, I don't know what is wrong with me but I still feel like something is missing. And to be honest, it is not the salary of the FAANG that attracts me, that I am pretty sure about, but I still can't figure out why I am being so much obsessed with FAANG and why am I participating in this rat race for FAANG. :?

Is it normal to be obsessed with this FAANG culture? Should I continue devoting all my energy and time to DSA questions, or should I focus on the development part of programming more?

For context I'm instate for UIUC, and I'm leaning more towards UIUC rn. Here are my pros and cons:

UIUC:

Pros:
- T5 CS Program so amazing academics+professors
- Good research opportunities
- Internship prospects through research park and university name
- I have friends who go there so I've seen the stuff they do/opps that they are getting
- Close to home but not too close 
- Can buy an apartment soph year
- Cost is super affordable because of scholarship + instate

Cons:
- Not close to a city
- My education will be strictly focused on CS (not a con for me imo but should consider)
- Lots of people from old school and hometown will be there 
- Won't have the same name prestige as Rice

Rice: 

Pros: 
- T20 CS program (not as good at uiuc though)
- Super nice campus in terms of how it looks 
- Great sense of community and smaller student body 
- Right next to Houston
- Decent internship and research opportunities
- interdisciplinary education 
- super prestige private school filled with amazing people

Cons:
- Not as good for cs at uiuc
- internship opportunities might not be as good
- opportunities after college might not be as good for CS/tech jobs
- campus looks a bit too small for me, like just that main hall
- no good fast food places by campus to my understanding, gonna suck when I got the munchies at 12 am
- heard mixed reviews about dining hall food
- community might feel too small at times seeing same faces all the time

Undergrad is not in CS and past work experience is not either.  Knowing applications are a numbers game, I've been furiously applying for the past few months and have recently had interest from two companies which I'm pleased with.  I'm currently weighing the opportunities at both companies.  Long term, I am interested in a software development role.

Company One: Big company, multinational, with a 300+ employee local office.  They are hiring for a software engineering intern.  The positions would be working in a small team of interns (5 with 2 data people, 2 front end people, and a PM type person) to develop a data lake with ML application to store and process industrial machine generated sensor data with the goal of creating a system which would notify users when their machine is about to go down.  The supervisor is experienced (30+ years in industry) but the process to apply has been bizarre.  I was never contacted by HR and communicated directly with a Sr. Manager who then ghosted me on vacation for a week after my second interview leaving me thinking they were not interested.  It is not clear if they are interested in converting interns to full time after graduations.

Company Two: Medium size company, 150+ employees, major corporate clients.  They are hiring for a quality analyst intern position.  This would be testing, code reviews, user stories, and quality control.  I would have 4 mentors (with about 4 years average tenure at the company) who are the quality team.  This is not the type of experience I was looking for directly, but they have been very vocal that they intentionally hire interns and make a point of having employees move into roles they are looking for within the company.  They have been very communicative through the process.  They have made it clear that if I knock this out I could have the opportunity to move into a full stack position after graduation.

I currently lean towards the bigger company simply because I would begin with a software engineering role.  But, I was so sure that they had moved on to other applicants that I applied to many more jobs in the mean time, which is how I came across company two.  I am concerned that type of treatment would continue there.  Both positions pay comparably.

What do you all think are the pro's and con's of these two positions?  I have only worked in the software industry before on the customer experience side of things so I am not quite experienced enough to know which trade offs are worth it.  Feel free to ask any other questions.  Really appreciate the input!"

mhaosb,6,2021-03-31,"Startup Company turned giant overnight with massive funding had developer leave after 1 week and suddenly, called me back AGAIN, and gave me an immediate hackerrank test and they are desperate, what should I do?",alienalgen94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mhaosb/startup_company_turned_giant_overnight_with/,"Update: I was able to get the HR recruiter to push out the test for 24 hours from now.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I have taken university classes in computer science I have done a few internship in web development and back end/ database engineering. At this point I knew C++, C#, HTML and Python.

After Covid for the last 6 months I have been doing online bootcamps in Reactjs, Bootstrap, Node, MongoDB, .NET, PostGres, Vuejs, as well as now Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform/Firebase.

I feel like I would be a great fit for their junior developer front end/full stack developer role.

Here is the kicker:

A recruiter (from a seperate recruiting company, from the company hiring me) found me on linkedIn and said she had a great ""blah blah blah"" tech job for me.

The recruiter has been on and off about the position first saying they need someone junior, I did a phone interview and now they need someone senior.

This is not true, the role says they need someone who can do ""everything"" include drone firmware programming, database architecture, docker kubernetes and full stack development with react and .net.

Upon having my phone interview this past monday with the lead developer he assured me it was a junior developer role and we talked about full stack development for a while and I assured him I could manipulate a DOM and write API's and paint pretty pictures with bootstrap.

Update to yesterday:

They pushed up the deadline saying I needed to be on site interviewing in 2 days. I then told recruiter I was not even looking at applying to jobs until my bootcamps were done at the end of April.

She said briefly ""oh okay we will keep you in mind"" and proceeded to hangup!

Then she calls again saying oh it is okay that you get hiring in May, ""blah blah blah bs"" and then wants me to take a hackkerank test today!

I gave her a hard ""Listen I need at least 24 hours to prepare"" and she starts off saying ""oh you know I think they need someone senior""

I stop her and say ""Excuse me, I spoke with the lead engineer and he said it IS a junior position ONLY mostly doing Reactjs and front end in Bootstrap, also your job requirements say you need {we need: insert 50 unrelated technologies here} and he said he only needs react and bootstrap"".

She apologizes and then I say ""Listen these hackerrank are very theory and very computer sciency and I have been in react and bootstrap and flutter land all year can you give me 1 week to prepare for this""

She says ""Listen, I really think we need someone more senior"", I follow with ""Okay, hang on, you called me and then told me no, then called me back and said take a hackerrank test immediately, I can take it just give me 24 hours to look over my notes and prepare, I am just looking for some humanity here!"".

She says ""okay, {sound: laughes shallowly} that makes sense"" which then I say ""listen is there some problem with this company?"" she goes ""Yes, they had a developer hired a week ago and then he just quit over the weekend"", I go ""oh wow ok that makes more sense"" she then goes "" I will email you again and ask him if you can take the test in 24 hours"". I say okay and we end the call.

So that was TODAY and I have 24 hours to ace a hackerrank which is probably going to test me on stacks and queues which I don't mind at all but my goal for the month was to go through cracking the code interview in the next 15 to 30 days and then apply to jobs being well prepared for any hacker ranks tests.

I mean I need a minute to go over all the theory and more data structures type questions personally.

Any tips for a dude with 24 hours to deal with a crazy startup turned rich overnight with funding?

What part of Cracking the code interview should I focus on, arrays, stacks, trees etc? Should I take this hackerrank? Should I turn it down and stick to my plan and actually apply to jobs I want to? She came to ME with this role and brought this chaos into my life.

Lots of love to the ppl going through this chaotic world of being hired into a tech role, or who have, or who will. Good luck and stay true to yourself and your values, I say."

That's the end of the journey for me !
A girl in my school got into grinnell so I think even my getting off the waitlist chances are 0 so ...
It hurts but it has been an incridble journey I am so gratefuel for. I LEARNED A LOT and I discovered so much about myself, but still, it would have been nice to get in somewhere. As an intl needing full aid, it would apparently be a miracle.
I have some regrets as not applying ea and choosing a wrong ed2 ( someone got in bowdoin in my country apprently that screwed up my chances). I also regret not applying to wealthier schools as amherst and williams since this year all 30% ar schools seem broke. I am considering reapplying but the process was draining and I dont know if I can handle it again.
Good luck to all of you and stay always positive !!!"

It said that the job was posted through Indeed. When I clicked “apply through website,” I was led to the job application on Workday, so I made a Workday account. I got confirmation emails saying that my application was received by the company for which I was applying. I tried to log onto Workday again to view my application, but it says that an account with my email doesn’t exist. I was able to somehow change the email that I used to make the account to my personal email instead of my school email to see if that would help, and it didn’t. I’ve tried calling Workday several times, but no one answered. The robot answering machine said to contact my “company or organization” through which I have my account, but I don’t have a specific company through which I made this account. I just made it freely to apply to this job. There are plenty of other applications I was interested in that require me to fill out an application through Workday, but I’m scared to use it again out of fear that this issue will repeat. I’m worried that I won’t be able to access my account to check my application status and apply for other jobs. Any suggestions?"

I'm a sophomore Math-Computer Science Major in a 3-2 Engineering Program. After applying to many internships for this summer, I got two offers! I need to respond soon and need help choosing... 

The first is a PwC Start Internship. This is PwC's diversity internship. Obviously PwC is a huge name, and it would be amazing to have experience from a firm of its magnitude. Furthermore, this internship program guarantees another internship offer next summer along with a full-time job offer in the future. My hesitancies are that it isn't really in my field - it's more Accounting/Finance than CS. Furthermore, the pay is great but it is only 6-weeks long. 

The second is a Campbell IT Leadership Internship. I don't see myself staying in IT forever, but I have an IT job on campus and I feel like it it much closer to my field of study. It is also a 12-week long internship, and while the pay is slightly less than PwC, I'd be making almost double over the whole summer. Of course, it isn't nearly as big of a name as PwC, and I wouldn't have a guaranteed offer in the future in regards to internships or jobs. 

Both are virtual. I'm a Math-CS major but my passion is CS and Engineering. I'm sure your early internships don't have to be exactly what you want to do for the rest of your life, and it'll be good to get experience no matter what, but I don't know what to do. I'm thinking mainly of the reputation of each for my future resume, future offers, pay, and experience. Please help!"

Update 4/8: Rejected from Stanford. Regardless of the decision, pretty happy that I had the chance to apply and go through the college application process + no harm done, since I had fee waivers all around. I'm debating between UC Berkeley and Claremont McKenna right now, so in a bit of a hard position! Thanks everyone!"

I’ve been at an internship at a well known company in my field for awhile now, and they just let me know they’d like to keep me on full time.

I really enjoy working here, and I cannot stress this enough, the people and culture are fantastic. Everyone I’ve met is super nice and welcoming, my boss and team are great, amazing work life balance (which from reading other posts, I know I should be grateful for lol). But there are a few things that are making me hesitate accepting an offer.

The biggest thing I am struggling with is the location. It’s in a big city, which is a great city but I’ve always wanted to move to NYC for a lot of reasons, #1 being the diversity (I know there have been a lot of recent attacks but regardless, NYC is the most diverse city and that’s very important to me as a POC. I also have some friends in NYC, love the fast paced aspect, events, etc. I’ve always wanted to move there and fully intend to, at some point. 

The location is truly the one thing holding me back from accepting an offer, but I can already imagine myself moving to the city that my current company is in, and I’d probably be searching for ways to move to NYC whether that be through a new company or the NYC location (which is not hiring right now in my department, otherwise I’d ask about that).

I also was in the interview process with a different company in my desired field in NYC a few months ago, and while it didn’t work out then, they encouraged me to reach back out if I was ever moving to NYC. That position isn’t necessarily my dream job, but neither is my current position, and frankly, as long as I’m in a place that I like, with people I like, I’m ok working a job that isn’t my “passion”. And it’s still in my desired field so I could make industry connections and still progress in the field. 

Am I crazy for considering contacting the 2nd company? I feel like it sounds stupid to turn down my current company (especially in today’s market, ESPECIALLY as a new grad, I already know how tough it is out there), but I just know that NYC is where I want to be. 

If you read this far thank you so so much and any and all advice is appreciated."

So I got admitted to UC to study CS, and I have a few questions for CS students

1 - What is POSt? I've come across it a lot, and it appears to be an issue among CS in particular. What implications would that have if you've been directly admitted to CS?

2 - What are the courses and coursework like? Are they hard, manageable, etc.?

3 - What's the balance like, between social life, academics, physical and mental health, and extracurricular activities.

4 - Lastly, more-so for students who may have graduated or are in their last years, what is employability like? Have you found it easy/hard to get recruited for internships, etc.?

Thank you guys for taking the time out to read and answer."

Have done some internships and worked all throughout school. Exhausted from applying and doing recruiting rounds since junior year of uni. 

I interviewed at a company for a full-time role and didn’t get it - but they offered me a summer internship with possibility to stay on in the fall should everyone think it’s a good fit. It’s a startup with good funding, about to double in size and enter market with their tech - a lot of uncertainty because it’s a startup, but also a great role with a lot of flexibility (they said they can let me do some data analysis as well). However, they want to know by the end of this week. 

I’m also in final round (5th round! insane) of another process for a full time role with a different company. That company said I cannot do the internship and work for them - they want an immediate start. I get horrible vibes from the interviewers; it’s a tiny company, and they told me the first six months of my role as a “trainee” will be reading and taking notes. However, it’s more prestigious, much more well paying, and overall more secure. It might also have better networking opportunities. BUT I do not have this position guaranteed - still have the last interview - but I must decide on the internship before the last interview takes place (neither company will move their dates to reply or review my application). 

Part of me wants to take the internship, even though there’s no guarantee of a job in the fall, because i’ll enjoy it, it gives me something to do (and makes money) over the summer while I keep looking for roles, and it doesn’t seem like a miserable place to work. I know that does open me up to more uncertainty, and I’ll need to keep applying to full time roles right now and over the summer. My academic advisor agrees with me and supports either taking this internship, or taking neither and continuing to apply to full time roles. However, the career person in my uni got very angry with me and said I was being stupid by throwing away an opportunity to have a full time role (even if it’s not assured that I’ll get the role) for an internship. This kind of knocked the wind out of me - am I being stupid for ending a process for a full time role? I’m also exhausted from applying - I’ve applied to over 200 things since January, had several awful dead end interviews, and have worked my hardest to get to the end of casing interviews for consulting just to be told i “dont have enough experience.” 

If you’re still reading - thank you so much! What would you all do? Am I missing something here? Are there any questions I should ask that I haven’t asked yet?"
mhgcgm,1,2021-03-31,How to negotiate a salary when you have multiple offers,augustusbennius,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mhgcgm/how_to_negotiate_a_salary_when_you_have_multiple/,"Hey y’all. I read the other posts about negotiating offers but I noticed none of them mentioned the case of multiple offers.

Background: 

- I received an offer from company A today and have an offer from company B I received a while back. 

- Both of these are entry level offers in low-medium COL areas specifically Fort Worth, TX and Lynchburg, VA.

- I want to go with company A but their offer is around 60K while the offer I received from company B was 70K. Again, I want to go with company A but the 60K seems a little low. 

- I did pretty well in the interviews and got the offer the following day. The hiring manager called me after to reiterate that I did well and said he would send an offer. I have previous experience doing the type of work I’m getting hired for at company A - although the experience was from internships.

- My goal would be to get company A to go upto 70K.

- average annual salary (without signing bonus, relocation , etc) is about 65K for my position and major. Factoring in different COL for Fort Worth and Lynchburg (~3%), if I want the same offer from company B, I should get ~72,000 from company A.

Questions and concerns:

- I haven’t officially asked if the offer company A is negotiable. If it is not, do y’all think I should still try to negotiate or do I have no leverage? I’m asking because I read another post on here where the recruiter mentioned the salary was not negotiable but the candidate still tried and ended up with +5k more.

- I definitely don’t want to lose my offer from company A. So, do y’all think it’s “safe” to ask for a 10k counter?

- I want to ask company A to match company B’s offer. How would I go about bringing up that I have another offer? Do I share with company A the name of the company, my role, and my entire compensating package (signing bonus, relocation, vacation days, insurance, retirement, etc)?

- if I should only mention I have another offer, and the recruiter asks me to send her my offer letter, what should I do? Should I send a redacted version of the offer letter?

From the beginning I've had a strong dislike for school because I don't learn well with the artificial academic problems they assign in classes and there are some days where I spend literally all day studying or doing homework. I had a lot more motivation preparing for interviews and polishing up personal projects I made which have an active userbase and honestly I feel like I've learned 100x more from those alone compared to what I've learned in college.

I find practical things to be much more enjoyable however I'm a bit concerned about my declining work ethic. On average how much different is working in industry, specifically as a software engineer, compared to college?"

Common App (8/10) - Focused on my interest in solving Rubik's Cubes since I was young and how it taught me to devise creative solutions to overcome obstacles. I then translated this to how I solved obstacles with my breast cancer research project. The writing quality wasn't anything amazing.

Supplements (8/10) - Mainly focused on my interest in studying the micro and macro scales of human health. I also sometimes talked about my less academic hobbies like soccer and cooking.

**Additional Information:**

* I dedicated a decent amount of my junior year studying for the ACT, because I liked the format better. Eventually ended up having all 3 of my tests cancelled. For the SAT I did report, it was the one at my school in October, and my school only notified me two weeks before the date, so I practically didn't get to study for it and it was somewhat blind.
* Many financial challenges for family before and during COVID
* My lab wanted me to wait until I graduated to publish anything because that's what previous interns had done
* A lot of competition cancellations

**Reflection:**

Going into the last week of decisions, I do not feel confident. I honestly cannot blame these colleges for rejecting me. My stats are not competitive enough and nothing about my application is unique. Sure COVID is a nice excuse for some flaws, but I really should've just pushed myself harder beforehand. There's quite a bit of pressure on me from my family, friends, and counselors to succeed, but it seems like it will not go that way. I’m grateful to have been accepted into the schools I have, but in others ways, I also feel like I failed. Rant over :)"

**Letters of Recommendation** Rated by how good our relationship is not by how good I think the letter is lol

history + econ teacher (10/10)- They were my teacher for one class sophomore year and two classes junior year. They really helped me realize how much I love economics. I’ve written research papers for their classes

Global politics teacher (8/10?)-  They know how interested I am in certain political issues and that I've done my own independent research on them. They’re also my EE advisor.

School counselor (8/10): They have been my counselor since 10th grade and I've met with them a lot for a few programs I've applied to throughout high school and because of some family issues (explained at the end of this post). They know me pretty well because of that.

**Interviews**

Georgetown interview: I actually thought this interview went pretty well. I applied to sfs for political economy and I got to talk about my economic and political interests a lot in the interview.

Barnard: don’t have too much to say about this one. My interviewer was nice but it was more of a casual interview and we talked about my hobbies outside of school more than my academic interests. It still went fairly well though.

Columbia: one of my scarier interviews. The questions were a bit harder but I think it went okay?? Idk for sure though.

Penn: This was 100% one of the scariest ones I did bc my interviewer was so accomplished. There was a good mix of easy and hard questions and at that point I had already answered most of the hard ones in my Columbia interview so I think I answered them well. The interviewer seemed to like me and I think I got my passion for my degree across so I’d say this one went well.

**Essays**

I don't really feel comfortable rating my essays because I am incredibly critical of myself so I'm not a good judge of my own work. I think my common app essay was okay?

I think my UCAS personal statement was my best essay so far. I just got to write about my passion for PPE and my ecs (which I love doing).

I think my supplements varied a bit. Some schools' supplements allowed me to talk about my passions and independent research more which I think is really important to my applications since I don't have much leadership or long-term clubs.

**Additional Information:**

-Two of my immediate family members passed away my freshman year which greatly affected my extracurriculars and grades. I was mainly focused on my mental health so I only did some volunteering here and there. I made sure to put all of that in my additional info section.
-did independent research (EE) with a school advisor which I wrote about in some essays and put it in the additional info section. It was a poli sci and econ paper so it was kinda important imo 

Anyway, I got hella waitlists from my match and some reach schools before I started getting acceptances so I’m really shocked by my results."
