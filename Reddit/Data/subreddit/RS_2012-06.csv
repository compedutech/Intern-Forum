I got a Masters in CS with a near-perfect GPA from a good school, did an internship that evolved into a dev role, and eventually got hired at what I considered my dream job.

The ""dream job"" eventually started getting tedious and I found it difficult to concentrate, so I mixed things up. I left things on a great note and I took a year off and traveled the world with my girlfriend.

Now I'm back, and I have a wide-open door to go back to the old job, but it feels so much like a step backwards and I'm not sure I want to. Despite that, I don't really see any other job postings that seem more appealing. I have an entrepreneurial bent and would love to do my own thing, but I'm in some kind of a post-trip funk and it seems irresponsible to work on a startup full-time with no real traction after such a long time out of the workforce. I've been on such a set career path for my whole life that it feels really weird being home and at this kind of crossroads. I feel like it's an important turning point and that if I could really get passionate about something and apply myself right now it would shape the rest of my life.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How would you go about making this decision/kicking your butt into gear?"

I have been doing very good in school, and in interviews I feel that I have held my own. So reddit, what do you think I can do to finally land that first internship, or even land a job? Any tips on ways to present myself more positively?

I feel like I cannot be the only one who has this problem. Engineering in my mind was a great career choice because a) i enjoy it, b) it pays well, and c) at the time when i applied, it seemed like there were engineering jobs everywhere. Now, I cannot seem to find anything.

On top of that, where would you recommend me to go to find a solid internship listing that has a subsection for electrical and computer engineers (though not programming - this is not my expertise in any way except for VHDL hardware logic programming)?"

Hey Reddit, I’m struggling with a job hunt and I’m looking for feedback/guidance/direction/a sounding board.

I’m in my mid-early 30s, married for 8 years to a wonderful woman who is a little older than me.  We have a 14 month old daughter – the absolute light of my life –and we just found out that my wife is pregnant with our second.  We would love for this to be an exciting time, but our financial/employment situation is making our future tremendously scary, to say the least.

I have always had trouble with employment.  I have a college degree, but it’s in the impractical field of film studies.  While I’m in California, I have no desire to work in film production.  I have a family to provide for, and film work is nothing if not intermittent.  Aside from an internship in a film production office more than a decade ago, I haven’t really worked in the film industry at all.

After college, I spent a couple of years – great years – working for an international resort company.  I designed and built theatrical sets and was de-facto stage manager for their nightly stage shows.  I left this company after 9/11 when I decided that I wanted to be closer to home.  I found a job in southern California working at another resort theater, first as a stage hand, then eventually as their technical director.  My stage manager connected me with a friend of hers who had a video production company (think wedding videos and such) and I was able to work part time with him.  The money wasn’t great, but I added a little more to my resume.  In that time, my wife (then girlfriend) and I started dating long distance.  She was a high school teacher and had tenure, so after two years with this particular theater at something like $10/hr, it made sense for me to relocate to where she was.  I was still in SoCal, but too far away to keep working for the theater or production house.  Before I moved, I asked video production owner-guy if they would have a full-time position for me because the theater schedule was just about the exact opposite of my wife’s (at this point, upgraded to fiancé) schedule.  He made an effort to create a position for me, but things took too long to fall in to place, so like I said, I ended up relocating.  No hard feelings.  Shortly after relocating, my wife and I got married.

Over the next two years, I worked for a “marketing” company, but really my time was spent in a warehouse issuing credits for damaged office furniture.  After a year and a half of this, I got an internship, and commuted an hour one-way three times a week to catalogue tapes for a small production company that had connections to the music scene in Long Beach. (the band Sublime, the Ziggens, etc.)  They asked me to edit a few things for them, and I told them that if I was editing, I needed to get paid.  So they wrote me a check for $13/hr.  At this point, I had a bit of a crisis and panicked, because how is a man supposed to support a family in SoCal at $13/hr? (My wife and I still had not had kids yet, but we knew we wanted to, and I was working towards becoming a provider.)

I called my dad, who has had a great deal of success in the insurance/financial services.  I lived many hours away, and we talked about me getting my insurance license and going to work with him in a sort of mentorship relationship.  My wife did not want to do this, as she would lose her tenure.  My argument was that if I was to ever become the provider for our family, we needed to take steps that would put me into that position.  I got my insurance license, and we made the move to a place I’ll just call “the coast.”

About 8 months after we got to the coast, my dad bailed.  He was having trouble with the company we worked for and got a great job in a somewhat similar industry, and there was no room to bring me along.  I wasn’t too bothered, because I picked up his entire book of business and was hoping to nurture that into more sales (read:income).  At the same time, I was also working part time for my church.  They had installed this $75,000 video system and really didn’t know what to do with it, so they paid me about $25,000/yr to design the weekly presentations on it, to keep the campus’ network running, and just be an all-around tech guru.  During this time, I also really built up my photoshop, design and visual presentation skills.  I redesigned the church’s logo and built a sort of brand identity for them.  If it weren’t for the money from my church job, I don’t know how we would have made it.  It supplemented the irregular and inconsistent commissions I was getting.  I wasn’t really cut out for insurance sales.  I have major “call reluctance.”  Who wants to get a call from their insurance guy?  Who wakes up in the morning and says “I want to buy life insurance today?”  So the insurance side of my income stagnated, and there was no room for advancement at my church.

At the same time, my wife was really struggling as well.  We’re now in 2007-8-9, and she had lost her tenure when she changed school districts.  Each year, she would get laid off because she was the most recent hire.  She’s a fantastic teacher – the best, really – so her references were often able to get her hired on in another nearby district.  Still, the job hoping took its toll on our peace of mind and our income.

Two years ago, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first.  While income was not great, we had insurance and we were supporting ourselves.  I still wasn’t making enough to support us all, and my wife couldn’t realistically teach and be a mom at the same time.  She puts so much energy into her teaching job – it’s easily 60 hours/week if not more.

After my daughter was born, my dad had gone back to work for a business owned and operated by our extended family.  This business was located in “the desert,” and was on its last legs due to some health problems my uncle was having.  Dad was trying to keep the business running, and wanted my help.  I put on my negotiating hat and got a large enough salary that I could support my family and we could buy a house.  Due to the lower cost of living in “the desert,” we could finally reach our goals of owning a home and having my wife stay home to be a mom for our infant daughter.

Unfortunately, this family business was doomed before dad even got here.  I won’t get into it, but I got to watch the bank seize all of the company’s assets and destroy my grandparents’ legacy.  This was all due to stuff that had been set in motion a few years back.  Dad and I still saw value in the intangible assets of the company, so we took the customer list and a few of the strongest employees and started a leaner, meaner company.  For six months now, this new company has hobbled along.  We haven’t received any outside funding, and it’s expensive to start a company, especially in California.  We’re working on an SBA loan, but the banks aren’t exactly eager to lend these days.  There has been multiple times where I didn’t know if I was going to get a paycheck, or it’s been delayed by a few days.   

And that’s where I am today.  I’ve got a new house payment, a wife who works too hard to do what she’s always done and still be a mom at the same time, and a job that pays decent money when it pays, but I don’t know if I’m going to see a paycheck next week.  I’m applying for work all over right now, because I’m tired of being afraid of my own ability to pay all of our bills on time.  I want decent income, and I want stability.

Most of the jobs I’m looking at are either entry level and pay about $25,000/yr, or they are specialist positions that require years of experience in a specific field.  So reddit, where should a guy like me go?  I’m a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.  I can do basic graphic design, I have an eye for marketing and presentation.  My experience in theater and time with my church has taught me the importance of precision timing in live production. I’ve been the network admin for three different small business networks.  I think my strategy should be to market myself to a small/medium organization that needs a little bit of all those things, but doesn’t need to hire a specialist in any one field. Am I on the right track?  And if so, how do I find an organization like that?  It’s not like careerbuilder.com turns up something when I search for design/marketing/presentation/IT guru.

**tl;dr:** I’ve have had a series of jobs, but no career.  At a point where I need “career” income.  Where do I go looking for a career with my unique set of skills?"

What are your experiences?

Realized that copying entire email correspondence is futile, here is selected stuff from hate mail i am proud of:
Point is that there is no wish to act, and act you can. Hiding behind regulations and bashing my morals won't change that.
In that spirit there can be no respect from me to you. Respect is reserved for people that earn it. Only fool gives it for granted.
And you are responsible, and you should take it seriously. 
Ah, about coming to LCs. I would rather take my testicles out with a pocket knife than loosing my youth there.
There will be no further discussion on this topic from my side, since I didn't expect or got any kind of honest response.
I hope you burn in fires of Kazad Dum (just kidding)

I am a 19 year old female living in a city away from home for the summer for a summer internship. I found a nice sublet (with strangers who I don't know really) close to my workplace in a relatively nice neighborhood. However, the thing is, the city I am working in is known for a relatively high crime rate.

My mother came to help me move in earlier this week and I have been sleeping on an air mattress, so that she can take the bed. I didn't expect her to stay for that long, but now she refuses to leave. Her reasoning is that:

* I am a female.
* I am young and I don't know how to live alone, despite me living in college alone for the past 3 years.
* The city is dangerous.
* The building doesn't have a good lock system (which is true, all of the doors are simply passcoded and the door to my room doesn't have a lock that I can lock from the outside.)
* I don't know my roommates or anyone in the city.
* She is paying for the apartment.

But my mother is driving me crazy. We don't have an amiable relationship and she is always paranoid and gossipy. Most of all, she treats me like I am 10 years old (including reinstating an 8pm curfew because of the city's ""crime"") and not letting me progress as an adult at all (other than going to work).

What can I do, if anything?

**edit:**
To answer some more comments:

* I am not financially dependent or remotely close to that yet. I still have debt and a full year of college left.
* There are people living in my family's house, so no worries there.
* One thing I forgot to add: I have had the talk with her that I want to be independent multiple times. She often guilts me by telling me how much I owe her for paying for university and how if I want her to leave so badly, she'll leave forever and I can say goodbye to my family because I am ungrateful.

I posted something earlier today, but I remained distant and vague in my explanation.

My girlfriend of eight months broke up with me a little bit more than a week ago. I know eight months isn’t a very long time and in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite trivial. But I’ve dated girls for more than a year and I’ve never felt this torn apart. She told me she no longer loved me. I saw this coming and I tried as hard as I could to keep our relationship together—and honestly I think that’s probably what tore us apart… I’ll explain.

We had a really good relationship. We were interested in the same things: action movies (Resident Evil, Avengers, etc.), videogames (Zelda of course!), Indian food (every Thursday), fitness, television shows (Burn Notice, White Collar, and Alias), and a lot more. I tried to help her with her school work as much as I could and she did cute things for me too, such as cooking me crepes or French toast in the morning.  
You and I both know the list of the good things could go on indefinitely--I’m in love with her.

However, there were issues like every relationship. We both had two majorly conflicting character traits.
 
I have an “anxiety disorder,” which is likely inherited from my father who tried to commit suicide a few years back, so I get extremely paranoid about whether the person I’m dating truly loves me. My paranoia and anxiety is also probably the result of my flawed family life. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad had an affair. He had two children with another women (a stripper actually), and he abused me childhood naivety; namely, he said that this situation was normal and that I shouldn’t tell my mother. For two years I knew about my dad’s affair while I watched my mother’s heart be slowly ripped into pieces as she wondered why my dad was becoming more distant by the day. She eventually found it and it wasn’t from my mouth. I regret that every day. Anyway…

Unfortunately, my paranoia was exacerbated by one of her quirks, specifically her distant and unaffectionate attitude. That is, she never gave me any sort of affection, which she said was the result of her depression and self-confidence issues that I will not go into for the sake of her privacy. I always said love you first. I cuddled with her. I kissed her and held her. And she never reciprocated; she never showed affection in return. She told me she didn’t like that I was affectionate because she didn’t like being touched by anyone (which is odd because for the first month and a half she was extremely affectionate).

Our two quirks collided obviously. Every day I became more and more paranoid. But I loved her, so I tried to conceal my paranoia as best as I could. In fact, it was the first time in my life that I could actually sort of contain it. I loved her and she hated my paranoia, so I tried so desperately hard to not be paranoid. Even though we had our issues and she still told me that she wanted to be with me. She said that if she couldn’t be in a relationship with me, then she wasn’t meant for anyone. She wanted to marry me and she actually designed our floor plans for our house one day. This was two weeks before our break up.

reddit, I no longer have passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I have an internship starting in 5 days at a Fortune 20 company and I need my motivation back. I’m going down the wrong road at this point. I don’t care about anything and I can’t be around anyone without being on the verge of breaking down and crying. I’m probably overly sensitive, but I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Maybe someone could share some advice."

I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.

Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."

:--|:--
[Nice work on the blog folks. FT Alphaville is my go to blog for interesting economic news. Your curation of the comments section means that the discussion is invariably worth reading too.  Congrats on the London Whale reporting. How much further do you think it goes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy440?context=5)|Re: London Whale. I swear I've spent too much of my life thinking about it!! :-) It's so interesting to see how it gets reported on and discussed, especially when you think about how little JPMorgan has actually said.  In the meantime, lots of reporters try to get access to people who might know something more. I think Bloomberg had an interesting piece today for one: ""JPMorgan’s Iksil Said To Take Big Risks Long Before Loss"".  Re: Sovereign CDS Pricing widget. I often wonder that too! I mean, I know a lot about the data, but what meaning to derive from CDS in the current environment? Especially sovereign CDS, because there are a lot of banks out there who will buy CDS mitigate counterparty risk exposure to those sovereigns, pushing the spreads wider and wider.
[What's the Eurozone endgame? Despite all the apocalyptic talk, markets have had a fair amount of time to prepare e.g. the Greek's triggering CDS payments was the non event of the century.  The Sovereign CDS Pricing on the right hand side of the blog is looking fairly dire but I've always wondered what the best way to read them is. Any guidance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy440?context=5)|The thing that fascinates me most is what this says about what regulators are up to with all that CDS data that they have access to. The fact that anyone could have seen market distortions and large volumes building up... and they have access to legal entity level info, so the concentration in the hands of one market player would have been quite visible.  I guess when I look at CDS spreads, I tend to look at them more relative to each other, and relative to their own time series, plus net notional and activity data. In isolation, they aren't that revealing, imo.
[A lot of financial market journalism seems to be driven by exploiting peer networks to provide an explanation of market moves. Currently there is a lot of leaning on the work of economists and analysts to do the quantitative sifting through data. It seems like the Alphaville team is also starting to back up the stories by doing their own quantitative analysis. Do you see this continuing? How important is a background in maths, economics and statistical analysis becoming for a journalist over having a large number of contacts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6fc?context=5)|I consider myself something of a data addict, and I think this influenced their decision to hire me. At least, I'm very much encouraged to do my own analysis. The thing about doing your own work with the data, or even lots of your own non-quantitative research (e.g. understanding a complicated legal case), is that it can take a lot of time. If you have a deadline, like newspaper journalists often do, it could be more challenging to pull off. That said, I'm sure it would be encouraged if agreed to in advance. Everyone likes having something unique. Alphaville is more flexible time-wise, which I really appreciate.  For myself, there's also this scary element to it because who do you have to check your work if you're on your own? Usually I try to call someone who's an expert in the area to talk them through what I did to see if they think I missed something. It can really be nerve-wrecking though to put yourself out there so much!  As for a economics/stats/maths background, I think it helps if you have a history of reading other people's analysis and critiquing it. We have a lot of research thrown at us and it's important to question it, especially if you are saying that you agree/disagree with the thrust of it rather than just passing it on for others to decide on themselves.
[Izzy - Citi would argue that the differential yields on EZ sovereign debt in part reflects a contingent FX rate i.e. how the asset will appreciate/depreciate in the event of a eurozone break up. Do you give this theory any credence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uygvn?context=5)|I think that makes a lot of sense.
[What did you do before the FT Izabella? I fricking love your take on things...so few other commentators think like you do, and are able to get it across like you. You need to replace Robert Peston.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyfs8?context=5)|I have always been a financial journalist. Have worked at Reuters, and at Platts, CNBC.. mainly specialising in commodities. I have an Ancient History degree however, and have always been interested in early and ancient economies, on the basis that we are destined to repeat the mistakes of the past, over and over :)
[Let me ask you this Izzy....do you contribute to a pension? or is it bricks and mortar for the next 30 years? or is it....no contributions and spend it all on alcohol before fiat money blows up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uylmc?context=5)|I don't believe in pensions (for myself anyway). Also I'm pretty sure that by the time I'm 80 I'll still be working because technology will allow us to keep working for much longer. I don't have any investments.
 |As an ancient historian I'm going Roman on this one. My investment will be my children/descendents.. (let's hope they don't turn out like Joffrey in GoT)
[1\) To all of you: Do you have a code of conduct when it comes to dealing with bulletin board soldiers from GKP et al.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9oc?context=5)|We have conduct rules for commenters -- such as don't be abusive -- and we do zap people from time to time.  But I will give you the old hand newspaper story that I share with my younger colleagues here, namely:  ""You get the letters page you edit"" -- ""If you print letter from people who write in green ink, the next post bag will be full of green ink.""
[2\) Izabella, I love your 'What is money' series and I think to myself sometimes how much time does it take to put the articles together / if you have help from others? They transcend many levels of financial thought and are just fantastic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9oc?context=5)|Very glad you like the posts. As to how much time they take.. it really depends on how inspired or passionate i am about the subject :) Sometimes I can just sit down and write a stream of consciousness and it turns out to make some sort of sense (or not, others will argue!), other times it takes a good week or so to research the idea and to bring it together. Generally, I think all of us are constantly developing story themes and ideas. That's the great thing about blogging.. You can just keep evolving and developing your story. It's very different to traditional journalism in that way. - Izabella.
[One last one, will Alphaville ever be behind a pay wall? Its my first point of call for economic news and is one of the few websites I couldnt live without.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9yr?context=5)|Alphaville will be free for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I'm not sure it would work in its current form behind a paywall.  Thanks for reading us mjpbol.
 |There are absolutely no plans for Alphaville to go behind the pay wall. In fact, the trend, if anything, has been the reverse. It used to be that our newsletters were for FT-subscribers or Cut-subscribers who paid a small fee (that was less than the full FT fee). We reversed that a couple of months ago and now you just have to be registered to get those. Registering is free.
 |In the future, it may well be the case that Alphaville requires registration to read posts. And again, registration is free, and it then allows you to get things like the newsletters. The upside for us of registration is that we get to stay free while having a better proposition for advertisers because they know a bit more about what type of people read Alphaville.
 |So, in short, one day there might be a trade off where if readers want to continue to visit us (and we very, very much hope they do) we might need a minimal amount of input about who they are.
 |(Lisa)
[Thanks for all the work on the blog, it's one of the few that I subscribe to on a daily basis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|Speaking for myself - if I *wasn't* regularly getting flak (feedback, really) from market participants, I'd be worried. Didn't go into being a journo to smooth feathers really. Actually it's very rare that I personally get flak because someone in the market didn't want the story out there (that's more what PRs do). Since it takes two views to make a market, it's more that they want their point of view across as well.
[One question I had was how do you come up with the majority of your stories?  Do you tend to sit down and discuss/think of most of them yourselves, or are they driven by tips from market participants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|As to where we dig up all this stuff. For me it's about 80% starts with just seeing something and digging in and asking around about it. That other 20% does tend to come from tip-offs, but these can often be pretty brief by necessity. So you then go back to the 80%. Looking back, on some of the fave stories I've done/broken on AV, the Finnish collateral stuff, ELA, all the Greek PSI ding-dong - these tended to start with initial tips and then grew from there.
[On the same note, if you're writing something controversial/that people would rather not see picked up in the MSM, do you get much flak from market participants? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|Joseph 
[What happened in Iceland?  Has that country paid back what it owed after the banking collapse in 2008? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyjrt?context=5)|[Link to www.imf.org](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1291.pdf)
 |Actually this might be a good opp for me to exorcise a little bit of macro tourism that's been bugging me...
 |OK, it's really important to remember that Iceland, the sovereign, never defaulted in 08. They're back selling dollar bonds now and everything. (You sometimes see the argument for Grexit citing Iceland as a great precedent. Nope.)
 |Iceland did decide that some its banks' liabilities were just too much to take on to the sovereign balance sheet, which is fair enough. But you also have to remember that Iceland also kept up talks on eg. Icesave.
 |The other thing... they got capital controls right, which made the devaluation of the currency a lot easier to manage. (Joseph)
[Izy Is it just me or does the whole world feel the same? Your intellectual power is simply phenomenal. You see stuff and understand concepts that make my eyes revolve in their orbs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyhbr?context=5)|Thanks that's very kind. My general rule is to look beyond the obvious (but on the right side of the conspiracy line). If the story is big and breaking now.. I'm kind of bored by it already. I look for clues to what the next big story may be. I love thinking deeply about topics as well as out of the box. I also don't want to waste people's time with noise. :) - Izabella.
[I have notice a trend for alphavillans to 'graduate' to the main paper over time. Is that what you are all aiming for or do you see AV as a place to stay for a while?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy4md?context=5)|Of course, those Alphavillains who have gone on to the FT (Sam Jones, hedgie correspondent, Helen Thomas, now over at mining, Neil who's Australia correspondent and Tracy Alloway, US Banks) are doing really well.
 |But, just speaking for myself (it's Joseph here), the funny thing is - there really is no career structure on AV. It's too new. (Even though Paul started this way back in 2006...) I think the rest of the media still hasn't really got its head round the idea that blogs - in general - AREN'T a 'beginners' level' for journos. Skill sets, etc. very different. (Joseph)
 |Ehwatay, thanks for this question.  Historically Alphaville has often functioned as a springboard to another job on the paper.  And hey, nothing wrong with that.  But the site continues to mature, and more than at any point since I joined, the team is comprised of bloggers who really want to keep blogging for as long as we can get away with it.  Writing for a blog and reporting for a paper are very different, and the people whose bylines you see on Alphaville these days have a strong preference for the former.  -- Cardiff.
[Does FT management get pissed that a free blog on their website is more popular with the average city types than their more traditional behind the pay wall articles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy7iw?context=5)|Thanks jdmerts for bringing forward the day when we might be forced, spitting and kicking, behind the wall!  Seriously though, there's lots of stuff behind the FT.com paywall that is hugely popular with City readers (I see the figures.) Higher-ups here accept that Alphaville relies on being a  member of the wider (free) financial blogosphere for its style and tone. And it's also acknowledged that we drive plenty of readers to the main site. That said, there is pressure on us to be more profitable -- and i suspect that will lead to us introducing compulsory registration at some stage. But we will remain free.  (Murphy)
[How do you get along with Martin Wolf?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyheo?context=5)|Martin? Great fun. Always feel like my IQ's gone up 10 points after speaking with him. (Joseph)
 |I can report that Wolf is excellent company, if a little scary. Brain on legs. I particularly like the way he's always ready to engage online -- which not all traditional newspaper columnists are prepared to do...  (Murphy)
[Regarding Greece, do you suspect Germany and the other powers that be have a secret plan for them to exit the Euro? For example, Greece leaves and then steps are taken reinforce the remaining Eurozone. At the moment there is no sign of such steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy4vh?context=5)|All right, trade secret - German officials are just the *worst* for leaking stuff. Don't ever get them to plan a surprise birthday party.  Sure, there must be contingency plans by now. That's what bureaucracies do. Make plans and file 'em away. But a secret, unified plan (which the Germans wouldn't leak)? It's not even clear that one end of the Troika knows what the other is doing or what the drivers for Grexit are.  But being bureaucracies, you've got to remember how much inertia is simply built in to the Troika's programme by now, two years on from starting it all. The IMF staff for example was talking about a longer adjustment period for the bailout at the last review, despite all this poker-playing between the Troika and Syriza at the moment. (Joseph)
[How do you guys deal with the whole ""dying industry"" thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyoso?context=5)|Yeah, terrible shame what's happened to banking. (Joseph)
[Is he the most respected person inside the FT?  If not, who is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyxhj?context=5)|I don't mind telling you that every Wolf column gets huge online traffic.  But there are some other cracking writers -- and on other subjects.  Think of Lucy Kellaway, or Nigel Andrews on film. he's in a league of his own.
[How well does the daily traffic on FT Alphaville correlate with the global economic uncertainty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy98d?context=5)|There's clear correlation Iksjwww. In the early days, our traffic grew in clearly defined steps: first big M&amp;A, then things like the Socgen rogue trader, and then into the Crunch. Nowadays, we get a swell of new readers with things like The JPM Whale and each escalation of the eurocrisis. One point to add:  traffic spikes higher when equity price fall and credits widen, rather than the other way round.  (Murphy)
[For each of you:  If you could only choose one economist to steer the US' fiscal and monetary policies through the recession/depression who would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy46c?context=5)|You mean like a supreme fiscal overlord and Fed chairman to boot? Hmm. Gosh. Well, I personally like Scott Sumner's work on NGDP level targeting... He blogs over at [Link to www.themoneyillusion.com](http://www.themoneyillusion.com) by the way. (Joseph)
[I guess I worded it wrong - I meant a particular economist's policy prescriptions....but that'll do ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy803?context=5)|AndyRooney, good question.  Of course, the job you're describing -- a kind of fiscal and monetary policy Grand Poobah -- doesn't exist.  But if I had to choose an economist whose outlook and views probably closest mirror my own, it would be Karl Smith (of Modeled Behavior fame).  This is fodder for a longer conversation and I don't agree with him on everything, but I'd want someone who not only would favour more stimulative policy now, but who also understands collateral effects both in financial markets and in households.  That's Karl, and he also was first to write about the household formation and durables depreciation trends that I'm keeping an eye on.  And I'm mostly on board with Karl's longer-term structural views as well -- on immigration, especially (which, yes, I view as a huge fiscal issue), but also his generally liberal-tarian outlook.  
[Given the horrifying performance from many schools of economics in predicting the crisis (not to mention the often ridiculous prescriptions they still have the temerity to toss off as if they made sense, not least in America but particularly in Europe\), it's perhaps unsurprising that alternative schools are seeing the light of day even in academia for the first time in a while.  How has the emergence of reality-based economics, such as the Minskian schools of Steve Keen's circuit theory and Warren Mosler's modern monetary theory, changed Alphaville's coverage of the ongoing crisis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyfkk?context=5)|I'll speak for myself, but to me the most interesting development in the last few years relates to the importance of the money-like properties of safe debt.  There's about a half-dozen economists and strategists doing great work on this (Singh, Pozsar, James Sweeney, Perry Merhling, a few others), or you can read any of AV's posts on the matter.  I'd also recommend Izzy's writings on MMT and, recently, on gold.  -- Cardiff.
[Lisa - how much of a cultural shift was it moving from Markit to the FT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy3mm?context=5)|Pretty big. I had a number of different jobs at Markit. The first one I did was CDS Portfolio Compression, which meant I had a lot of banks as clients. It was very high pressure.
 |Then I was in the Credit Data team, and then finally in a kind of hybrid role. In the last role, I got to work with new colleagues from Wall Street on Demand (that Markit acquired) as well as the economists, who I'd never worked with before. Also, I started speaking to journalists about the dataset... which ultimately led me to Alphaville.
 |I knew zero about how journalism works before I started at the FT. It's been interesting learning about it! Alphaville is great in that you have a lot of flexibility to pursue topics that interest you.
 |If I had to summarise it though, it felt a lot like moving from the sellside to the buyside. You know, instead of hanging up and then swearing, I can swear and then hang up. (Just kidding, I'm nice really.)
 |(Lisa)
[What is Alphaville's current thoughts on the US debt ceiling deja vu? Without getting too much into politics, do you find a situation in which the Republican party holds the debt ceiling hostage again this year to score political points in an election year a possibility? If so, what might that imply for the US with respect to potential credit rating revisions and/or other negative impacts on the economy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyi8i?context=5)|I think the most likely outcome is simply that Congress, in the lame duck session, will decide on another temporary postponement until the new Congress (and possibly new President) has taken over in the new year.  But make no mistake: I'm worried about this, and about the rest of the fiscal cliff issues.  The potential for a mistake is very high, and lame duck sessions make for notoriously precarious political environments. -- Cardiff.
[The blog roll is all very good, but who do you actually read first in the morning? Do you split it and discuss? Or do you have a list of tabs &amp; sites you look at individually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uynqt?context=5)|Praxis, don't have a typical morning, but it's always some mishmash of whatever people are linking to on Twitter, the morning papers, catching up on earlier FTAV posts from London and Geneva, as many analyst research notes as we can get through, and in my case a handful of bloggers that I consider must-reads (Marginal Revolution, Felix, Econbrowser, Modeled Behavior, a few others).  -- Cardiff.
[Cheers Cardiff! anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uz05y?context=5)|Joseph here! It's funny being in NY because your mortal enemy is the time difference with European markets.
 |One of the first thing I like reading is what I guess you could call the 'practitioner' finblogs - so that's John Hempton, TED, Cassandra does Tokyo, Condor Options, Distressed Debt Investing, and loads more. It helps that they're all tweeting as well. The academics (the ones CG mentioned, a few others - Scott Sumner, the underrated British econ bloggers).
 |Loads and loads and loads of research, obviously. I do read it all.
 |And then... scouring the FT and the rest of the comp. As a journo, I'm usually reading not just to get info but look for good writing. And to kick myself when someone's got a story I missed.
[Ty for the reply. the blog network you link to in the right hand column...do you find it increases your readership or is it because you think they are genuinely good blogs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uykzi?context=5)|It's a mix.  Most are blogs we visit regularly.  A small number are there as favours.  An important portion of our readership comes from other blogs, so we are more than happy to reciprocate. (Murphy)
[What's it like for European elites to watch the euro project collapse? Are there still many policymakers who don't understand the fundamental flaws of the currency union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyjyu?context=5)|That time when the European Financial Stability Facility was going to sell ersatz sovereign CDS thingies was pretty wacky. (Wait, are they still doing that?)  As for those policymakers... “We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it.” - Jean-Claude Juncker  I still think that the whole idea of pay-as-you-go CDS is pretty insane. A lot of the structured CDS, e.g. ABX and the tranches thereof, are/were like that. They pay out with each little non-payment.  As for the European elites, I'm going to cross my fingers and hope that some of their staffers have a clue at least.
[What is your view of the really pessimistic, end of the world goldbugs/tin food people that contribute to the comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uya7s?context=5)|I'm ok with them, so long as they can write well and/or entertain us.  One regular tin-food-er we have is called coffin.dodger.  He genuinely makes me laugh.
 |And he might be on to something....

[Imagine there is an internet attack on the Financial Times because someone doesn't really like salmon, and your website is down.

[Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that you think the flow of money out of China is an under-reported story, most notably compared to the problems in Europe.

[How are finance company PR's responding to Blogs, Twitter and other social media. Do they engage or pretend it's not their?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy7a1?context=5)|I think they are working hard to catch up -- but you really would not have wanted to start from their position.

If something is a rumour and its important and we think we can verify it, we will do that. But as financial regulation has tightened it becomes increasingly difficult for journalists to verify things, since everyone in your industry has become paranoid about information flows.  It's all subjective, but sometimes we do say:  ""This is what we hear is/has happened. But the information remains speculative.""  Also see the ""raw"" definition during a markets Live session.
[What lessons do you think have been drawn from the FT Tilt launch? It seemed like a great idea but presumably never attained the critical mass of paying readers. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyjar?context=5)|I'm still a tad sore about Tilt.  I think the base idea was sound and we had a good team of young writers. Also the tech was good.  But we were trying to sell a high ticket subscription into a fast deteriorating market segment -- remember the EM space was not a particularly good place to be last year.  Deteriorating again right now as it happens.  Key lesson (that i can share here):  get your pricing right and get some keystone subscribers before launch...  (murphy) 
[Do you think that the consequences of 50% youth unemployment in places like Greece and Spain has been realised yet (by the market/politicians\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uz8nq?context=5)|I don't think it has been realised in the core eurozone countries at all. And I don't think we properly understand, sitting here in London. For context, i grew up through the ""mass unemployment"" of the early Thatcher years -- with lots of riots, barren council estates, etc. It was not pretty.  And we didn't have a youth unemployment problem anything like that faced by the Spanish etc today.  (murphy)

Whatcha think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy8ni?context=5)|We try our best not to give stock-picking advice, but as to the pattern in US NFP, to some extent this isn't surprising given what happened in prior years, and I wrote a series of posts earlier this year explaining some work on seasonality adjustment issues by Nomura and Goldman economists.  But my line throughout this recovery is that things were never as good as we thought in the best of times (early this year), but also never as bad as we thought in the worst (last August).  This has been a steady, too-slow recovery that hasn't jumped to above-potential growth yet.  Little has changed. -- Cardiff.
[I guess I have a question about financial reporting in general.  A lot of financial advice revolves around looking in the long term due to the emphasis on using the stock market to plan for retirement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uz5vi?context=5)|I think this is 100% true -- So much financial media -- especially broadcast media -- is focused on short-term movements, as though the only people needing commentary and advice are day traders. I think the longer term advice more people need is difficult to project on TV. (murphy) Honestly I think it's because the news networks are committed to going on air every day. If you only talk about the longer term, you'd have to wait a long time for stuff to move, then you'd analyse and talk about that, then you'd have nothing to say tomorrow, right? I remember when Jim Cramer was taken to task by Jon Stewart on the Daily Show for some of the advice he'd given. Part of his response was that ""it's entertainment"". Worth keeping that one in mind... Ideally, imo, reporting is a mix of examining short term and long term trends. But there are a lot of people who are in jobs with deadlines and they have to write something or they won't get paid. That's the reality. (Lisa) Also, when I was in analyst training (at a bank in Canary Wharf, for an internship), the guy teaching us said, ""whenever you pick up the FT, remember that newspapers don't sell if the front page has 'Markets Calm!

Just to recap - we had a warning in July '11 when Italian bonds sold off hard over a short period of time. By November the bonds had become a major cause/casualty of the freeze in interbank markets (in their capacity as collateral). When Italy can't borrow cash for 12 months without paying a 7 per cent rate...

I am an undergrad pursuing a degree in computer engineering at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.  I have done well so far, with a 3.9 GPA, and am fluent in English and Spanish and learning a few other languages, but even with any relevant qualifications, I am still worried about finding a career in the industry.

I have obtained a job at an electrical engineering design and manufacturing company nearby, where I  have been successfully employed as an embedded software engineer, and I am also being taught practical electrical engineering concepts as they apply to the projects I work on.  The job is amazing but I view it more as a stepping-stone to a long-term career.

Essentially, it is my dream to work at either Google, Intel, or Apple (me and everyone else, I know).  I applied for an internship at Google (on the Google Translate team) last year but was denied based on what I perceive as a lack of experience, as I am just now entering my Junior year and did not have the aforementioned job at the time.

My questions are as follows: 

-Does anyone here work at Google, Apple or Intel? If so, what advice can you give me to aid my in my pursuit of my dream job?

-What other companies offer desirable employment for computer engineers?

-Where is the biggest demand for CEs in the U.S. or Spanish-speaking countries?

-How difficult is it finding a job as a computer engineer in the U.S. with all the overseas programming jobs?

-Have you ever had the need to speak another language (Spanish?) on the job? I feel bilingualism is one of my most prized qualifications.

-On a daily basis, what do you computer engineers out there do? What does a typical day (if that exists) look like?

-What general tips can you give me as I finish my last few years as an undergraduate student looking for a career?

Thanks and sorry for the wall of text."

The classes were taught in Scheme (Lisp dialect), C, and more C respectively, with a bit of assembly

I try and learn things on my own, the best/biggest non-school related work I've done is a really small version of Conway's Game of Life done in Python, C, and C++ (independent versions). The Python version I used to learn some GTK and added a GUI.

uhwo8,1,2012-06-02,I've put my education at risk and I want to fix it. Can r/AskReddit help me improve my future?,BrewerHimself,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uhwo8/ive_put_my_education_at_risk_and_i_want_to_fix_it/,"Hello there, r/AskReddit! I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I spent two years studying abroad in Canada (I’m American) and I had no success. I partied too much and made excuses for my poor grades. I have a similar history with high school, but I’m ready to get serious about my future.

I recently moved back in with my mom in Florida. She moved here from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I haven’t spent much time here so I don’t have any friends. I’m working a full-time retail sales job right now that is satisfying, but not totally fulfilling. I’ve been strongly considering taking a year off from school and using this year to become a better programmer, but I’ve realized that I don’t want to be just a programmer. I want to be an algorist. I want to work on hard problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as discrete and combinatorial mathematics. I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.
Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."
uhvym,1189,2012-06-02,Don't Turn off the Webcam,0450AZ001,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uhvym/dont_turn_off_the_webcam/,"Linh and I met in 2008. She was from a very small town in Washington with a population of less than five hundred. I was working my way through college as an event bartender in Portland. Linh’s cousin was getting married in Portland, and as fate would have it, the wedding reception was held at an upscale hotel on the Columbia River where I frequently tended to small wine and beer bars. I noticed her immediately, as I often notice women that I quickly convince myself are too beautiful to ever date someone like me. Eventually as the night went on, she made her way over to my bar and ordered a white wine. We talked for a while about Portland. I sweated profusely as I tend to do around girls like her. She would be spending the next two days in the city, and I took a few moments telling her about the most interesting sights to see and things to do in town. 

“Wow, you should just be my personal tour guide” she said, grabbing my arm and smiling. This happened to me so infrequently that I really had no idea how to react, so I just mumbled “Sure, what time?” and laughed nervously to hedge in the event that she was joking. “How about 10:30 tomorrow morning” she replied.

And so started my relationship with Linh. She was infectious, with a personality that was so innocent and warm. I immediately fell in love with her. There were a few issues that we would have to work through. She was still in Washington and I was finishing school in Oregon. Linh was Vietnamese with a very traditional father who would never approve of her having a white boyfriend. She lived alone in a house with her father as her mother had passed away several years earlier, so going to Yarrow Point to visit her was out of the question. She would come to see me every three weeks under the guise of a prestigious internship program. 

Being in a long distance relationship, we spoke on the phone and texted constantly. When high speed internet finally came to her small town in Washington, I surprised her with a webcam for her computer so we could have an even better means of long distance communication. In the back of my mind, I was always looking for ways to be with her as even after two years of dating I was paranoid a girl as beautiful as her would eventually find somebody better to share her life with. 

In 2010, Linh’s father passed away suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack. He was everything to her, and she was heartbroken. When she returned from Florida where the funeral was held and her father buried, she was all alone in the house where she had lost both of her parents. With Linh’s father deceased, she was open to finally allowing me to come to Washington to see her, which we planned on doing in a few weeks after my college finals.

One night during our usual bedtime conversation, Linh mentioned to me that her father had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his death. She explained that he had taken to checking up on her multiple times throughout the day and night, and scattering religious artifacts throughout the house. This behavior, she said, was highly uncharacteristic of him. Vietnamese culture and religion was something foreign to me, and at various points Linh had mentioned things like this that I normally wrote off as just being a little silly. She explained to me that being in the house alone without her Dad was emotional and may be playing tricks on her. She hated the feeling of being so alone. She told me that being able to see me on her webcam was the closest thing she had to family, and asked that I promise to never turn off the webcam. She meant the world to me, so I was happy to oblige.

A few days passed and it was now the Tuesday before the weekend when I would finally come to see her in Washington. We spent our bedtime webcam session excitedly talking about our plans and I dozed off with my head on the kitchen table in mid conversation. It had been a long day. When I woke up, I saw Linh sleeping on my screen and stumbled off to bed. 

At 3:00am, my cell phone begin to ring. Disoriented, I rolled over, took a look at the clock and knew it could only be her. She took great pleasure in waking me up in the middle of the night to let me know that she had just gotten a drink of water, or had an amusing dream. Anyone else would have gotten an earful from me, but her flirtatious giggle made me feel lucky to have my much needed sleep interrupted.

""I had a nightmare"" Linh gasped. ""...You danced in front of my friends"". She burst into laughter. 

""What are you doing up so late honey? You've got to work in the morning?"" I said.

""I was thirsty, and went downstairs to get a drink of water.""

""Great, well we really should go back to sleep, tomorrow is a big day"".

""Allllright"" she conceded, ""Hey by the way, don't forg----""

After a few crackles and a brief burst of static, the call disconnected. I hated Linh's phone, she had an old flip phone that dropped calls with no rhyme or reason at least three times a day. I held down the #1 on my own phone, my speed dial for Linh. No ring, straight to voicemail. 

I tried to call several more times, and each time it again went straight to voicemail. 

I was exhausted, and though I loved Linh to death, to be honest I just wanted to go back to sleep. My eyelids hung heavy.

A little annoyed, I decided to walk out to my kitchen for a quick drink of water. The two glasses of wine that I drank before bed had left me with a little bit of dry mouth. As I rinsed the glass and went to place it in the dishwasher, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement on the glow of the laptop perched on my dining room table. 

It was the webcam. Two fluffy brown paws were making a swimming motion directly in front of her camera. As I got closer I saw a close up of two grinning faces. One of that silly dog of hers, and the other of my giggling girlfriend, who knew that eventually after being unable to make phone contact I would wander out to the webcam to say goodnight. I wouldn't put it past her to turn the phone off on purpose to elaborately stage this scene. Me, standing in my underwear at 3am on a work night, half asleep staring at a girl and a puppy on a webcam. 

I waved goodnight, and she kissed the lens of the webcam and pulled away.

I froze.

I wiped my eyes and looked again.

There.

It's... standing in the corner of the room. It’s...

Staring at her. 

Wrinkled. Angry, twisted mouth. 

Hateful eyes. 

What the fuck. 

HATEFUL eyes. 

It’s watching her.

-------------------


Two hours later, I woke on the dining room floor. I had a ringing in my ears and a knot on the back of my head. I immediately knew what had happened. It wasn't the first time. Sudden, extreme stress has given me panic attacks and black outs a few times before. I had never felt such fear when what had happened came rushing back and I nearly had a second panic attack when my thoughts turned to Linh. I loved her more than anything in the world. It took me several moments to summon the courage the look in the direction of my laptop. When I finally did, the screensaver had long since turned on. I looked away from the screen as I flicked the touchpad with my shaking finger. It took me another two minutes to open my eyes. 

Linh laid sleeping in her bed. She looked so peaceful. Sleeping on her side, facing towards the webcam. As frightened and confused as I was, relief at her safety gave me a sense of comfort as I desperately tried to process what had happened. Maybe the wine had hit me harder than I thought. Maybe I slipped and fell on the slick tile floor, and it all had been a nightmare.

I stared at her. I loved her. Maybe more than even I realized. So peaceful and beautiful as she slept.

The light of her television danced across her room and illuminated the bed.
As I watched on, her hand began to move. 

Slowly. 

Unnaturally. 

She was sleeping but her fingers crawled across the bed slowly until they reached something. It was her cell phone. 

Her hand moved like a spider, fingers popping in several directions across the keys.

What the hell?

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

My phone was vibrating.

""New Message: DON'T...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: TURN...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: OFF""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: THE""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: WEB""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: CAM""

Complete terror set in as the messages came across the screen of my cell phone.

""New Message: DON'T...""

""New Message: TURN...""

""New Message: OFF""

""New Message: THE""

""New Message: WEB""

""New Message: CAM""

As I glanced back to my laptop, horror overcame me as slowly a shadow crept across the floor. Something was crossing in front of the television. Moving closer to Linh.

I told myself it was just her dog, right? The color drained out of my face when I noticed the puppy sleeping in the far corner of the room.

I picked up my phone and dialed Linh. I didn’t know what I would tell her, but I knew she needed to get out of there immediately and never go back. Dammit straight to voicemail! THAT STUPID OLD PHONE OF HERS.

The full shadow now hung completely over Linh.

Her hand jerked, flipping open her cell phone.

My phone was ringing.

I answered, “LINH! LINH CAN YOU HEAR ME YOU NEED TO…""

A burst of loud static forced my phone reflexively away from my ear.

On the webcam I saw Linh’s lips begin to move. Her eyes were shut, but she was speaking.

I heard her voice come across the phone, but something wasn’t right. She was speaking, but a second, deeper voice echoed hers in perfect unison.

“DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM…. AGRAMON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM. AGRAMON IS READY FOR YOU NOW”

“Who? What? What does he want?” I yelled in desperation.

“HE WANTS TO EAT YOUR SKIN”. 

The line disconnected.

The shadow across Linh’s bed changed directions.

It started moving away from the bed… and towards her laptop… towards the webcam.

As the shadow moved closer small streams of gray liquid rolled towards the lens.

The images coming across my monitor began to shake violently.

It was almost here. I could now see the top of it’s head. It was CRAWLING towards me. Wet strings of silver and black hair hanging over it’s face. I remembered those hateful eyes and I lost control of my bladder as it slowly begin to tilt it’s head up. 

And then I did it. 

In panic I slammed my laptop shut and threw it against the hard tile floor before collapsing to the ground.

I wished for a panic attack to take my consciousness and end this nightmare, but it didn’t come.

I crawled to the panel of switches a few feet up on the wall and turned on every light that I could. I noticed the bottle of wine still open on the kitchen counter and drank most of it down in a single swallow. I reached up and pulled open my apartment door, and stumbled across the threshold, extending half of my body into the common hallway so I wouldn’t feel so alone. A pathetic coward sprawled out on the concrete. 

My phone began to ring.

I crawled to it. Linh’s name was flashing on the caller ID. I held it in my hand, paralyzed by fear.

And then the ringing stopped.

I took another mouthful of wine and mustered the courage to call back. It went straight to voicemail. And then again and again as I tried to call.

Eventually the shock and drowsiness from the wine got the better of me, and I passed out on the floor after making a few more attempts.

When I awoke several hours later, despite the broken laptop and empty bottle, I wanted to believe that it was all some sort of horrible nightmare.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue flashing light on my cell phone.

“You Have One New Voicemail”

My hand trembled as I dialed my voicemail and entered my passcode.

The message was time stamped, and was from the missed call I had from Linh before passing out.

Her voice. She was in tears and frightened as though I had never heard her before.

“You promised. Why…….why did you….turn off the web …webcam… “

“His… his tongue … burns “

With a crackle the message ended. 

-----

Two years have passed since that night. I never tried to contact Linh again. I never called her work to see if she came in the following morning. I never made it to Yarrow Point in Washington where she lived. She was my soul mate, and I let this happen. I was probably right on the night we met when I told myself I wasn’t man enough for her.

The only reason I am telling this story today, under the cowardly vale of anonymity, is because my drug and alcohol counselor thinks it would be good for me. So here it is. I made the decision to let the love of my life face an unimaginable nightmare to spare myself, and the worst part is that I may not even regret it.  

Now if you will excuse me, I think I need another drink.

what else can i do with this degree? I'm not stopping now, I LIKE learning about EE but doing it at this job is very different.  I want to be able to get a good job and support a family but I dont know what to do now. help?"
ul023,67,2012-06-04,Alone...Right?,DeadlyToken,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ul023/aloneright/,"This weekend I was completely alone, everyone was out of the house and my mother trusted me enough to not burn down the house (but i think she still slightly relied upon the interns here who came for morning and nightly chores...). I woke up on Saturday and being me, immediately logged into Reddit. I checked out a few posts, then went downstairs and grabbed a bowl of cereal. 

The dogs were quiet... which was very odd but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. They're always barking and yapping at random cats moving about the yard. (I live on a farm with 103 horses, 8 dogs, 40 cattle, 50 cats, and 7 donkeys, quiet is rare.) Soon enough, I started watching TheAmazingAtheist. Behind me, I heard my door open and close. I whipped around and looked behind me. Nobody there, I yelled ""Hello?"" like any girl in a horror movie. No answer. I scolded myself for that, who did I expect? The boogyman? Maybe Nosleep was getting to me, i remember thinking.
 
 I forgot about it within about 10 minutes. So I started talking to friends on facebook, the usual chatter that you'd expect about summer. When I got up to get a glass of water, the guitars started strumming. I froze. The strumming sped up and I cautiously turned the corner into the living room where they were kept. The guitars looked untouched, and undisturbed. I tried to laugh it off as hearing things. For the next hour I felt uneasy. 

My mother called me, and I was relieved, I started walking to my room but I had my foot on the first step when my brother's prized baseball came rolling down the steps... it was in a case, in his wardrobe in his room... And he hasn't been here for a week.  I tried my best to make myself believe that my sister, Katie, had been playing with it... but I couldn't believe it. Nosleep has taught me to try and rationalize out first, then believe. 

About 10ish, I made myself supper, watched a movie, then went to take a shower. As i was stepping in, I felt this unbearable feeling of being watched, and subconsciously pulled my towel tighter around myself. Yes, I keep the towel on until I am in the shower and the windows are fogged since we still don't have blinds in the bathroom. I did my routine, and was halfway through the Proactive facewash treatment when... In the mirror i saw someone. I turned, but of course there wasn''t anyone there. I quickly dried my face and left. After a few hours of Alesana and talking to friend, I passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to find a slice on my leg from my knee to my ankle. Red and puffy, it screamed in protest when I brushed it against the mattress. I hobbled to the bathroom, and let my dogs out on the way. I came out, and I immediately heard this whispering and giggling. Stupidly, I called out ""hello?"" and the sounds stopped. Being easily freaked, I wrapped up my leg, and grabbed my laptop. F7u12 is where I was for awhile, but decided to come here. 

At around noon, I heard this ear splitting scream, my hands flew up to cover my ears and I curled into the fetal position. I remember screaming ""Stop it!"" Silence. The dogs were barking and whimpering, and I was in hysterics, so I asked my mom if someone could come home, she said I could go do chores instead. So I went across the road to check water, and was greeted by this ticking sound, like the old bike my sister rides. I sped up the pace and came back home. I strummed my guitar, did a few scales, retuned, but it didn't help me relax. I went back on Facebook to see if anyone was willing to come over, or at least talk to me... before someone blew behind my ear. I flipped my laptop and it crashed to the ground, then I started crying.

For the remainder of the evening, I sat in the living room with 3 white candles, my dogs, and a movie playing at full blast. I may be paranoid... but when I woke up this morning there was a note beside me saying, ""Sweet dreams""... Nobody came in until noon today, and everyone denies being home last night."
ukt2x,1,2012-06-04,"Just graduated with what I think a great resume, but I have no idea what to do.",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ukt2x/just_graduated_with_what_i_think_a_great_resume/,"Hey guys, let me start off saying I'm asking for advice. If this is the wrong place, please don't read further and tell me where to go.

I moved this part from bottom to the top of my post: I learned a lot in college. But even after everything I learned, there was no one person who could tell me how to get started or the type of jobs in the field. No one in my family does computers and my advisers are to far removed or worked in the military.

First some background:

I graduated in early may from the University of Tampa with a degree in Management Information Systems. I graduated with a 3.72 overall gpa and a near perfect gpa in MIS (I got all A's and only one AB). I received 2012 Outstanding Graduate in my major, and two of the most difficult teachers in the program that everyone hates told me I was one of the best students they ever had. I did this with minimal work and I don't feel like I learned anything/very smart. I read this subreddit and just feel overwhelmed and have no clue what you guys are talking about majority of the time.  My coursework focused heavily on Information Design (mostly Object Oriented), IS Security, SAP and sql databases. I had two internships, one which I'd say is B.S. and one where I did system admin duties in a lab...by myself...working with no-one.

I moved back to new york (where my family lives) when I graduated. I'm looking for jobs in both Tampa, and NYC/Long Island. I only applied to two places, my old internship where they said I did everything perfect (funding got cut for my program) and another place in tampa. I don't think there's a position available for me at my old job despite really fitting in well there. I put my resume online at monster and dice 4 business days ago. I've been getting about 3 calls/emails a day from places in NYC, all for system admin jobs from recruiters. 

My problem?

All of them have asked about my Linux knowledge and what I would say my strongest skills are for the position. I don't know shit about either! I don't know how to answer these questions. I'm never nervous about interviews/phone calls so I tell them the straight up truth about what I've done. I worked only with an old outdated windows 2003 and fedora 7. I got asked about my home setup.. I don't have a home setup. I have a 1k gaming asus laptop (I don't even game). I don't know how to get even started or practice. My major had nothing to do with this and when I look it up I just feel so overwhelmed (I guess partially thanks to my panic...). I got a call today and scheduled a interview for Wednesday. At the end of the phone call the recruiter told me the position was actually mostly tech support with some sysadmin duties for 17-23 a hour. I got that much with my internship in Tampa. I'm going to call back and say I'm not interested (esp. for tech support). 

my questions:
Should I be looking for a IT job in a different position and not sys admin? 
What kind of starting pay should I be looking for in NYC?
Am I wrong to be panicked about my skills?
How do I improve my skills? I'm a excellent learner, which is why I got through school so easily by doing bare minimum. 

Believe me, I researched before I came here, and it only made me more confused than ever. I wasn't panicked. Now I am. I need some personal advice...

Other notes:
I have Information Systems Analyst (ISA) cert, and I'm on the verge of passing CISSP (maybe 3 months more studying). If I studied for the SAP TERP10 I could pass, I don't like SAP though. No other certs.
I have a security clearance.
My programming skills suck.
Example of my resume with some stuff X'd out: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByffL1FF50iYOWQzejhHb1JxR1E

I know this is kind of a mess, but hopefully I got my situation across. If I got confusing anywhere please tell me. If any professionals in the industry can help me I'd seriously may fall in love with you.  Thank you so much."

I am interested in mechanics, but I've been spending at least 20 hours per week on the computer since i'm 10 years old (mostly gaming and stuff). I feel good on a computer and i have done some very very light programming in the past in visual basic. I have a great mind for 3D and I think outside of the box. I am currently in a Intern as a ME and I like it, but I don't see myself doing this kind of work for 25 years. I was wondering what is a typical day-job in the shoes of a programmer/architect/analyst/lead/project manager/whatever relates to CS. I would like to have a global view of the jobs i could have if i switch to CS.

uk7xw,2,2012-06-04,"Do you think IT professionals should have a code of ethics/professional responsibility such as doctors and lawyers do?
",non-confidential,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uk7xw/do_you_think_it_professionals_should_have_a_code/,"It starts with me. I was once a IT assistant (internship). I worked in at least two organizations where the technology was up-to-date but the people were not very tech savvy. They were competent enough to handle day to day software but knew very little about Windows or how networks work. They didn't need to. 

It started with the recruitment of a new director of sales. He knew very little about computers in general. Much of his work on computers revolved around analyzing reports and using email. On this particular day, he was overseas and he emailed me directly requesting the web address for our web mail access portal. I reply back with it. Soon after he asks me what the username and password should be. I tell him what his username would be and that the password would be whatever he uses to log on to his computer. He replies back thanking me and saying it was still the default password we assigned to him. 

I think I was tempted then but I held back. Later when I got home I accessed his email via Tor. I was being extra-careful and ensured that I was in the same country as he was. I proceeded to read hundreds of emails. I was hooked on the information. Much of it was boring sales blabber. But so much of it was also discussions about employees, their problems and executive decisions. I stayed up quite late into the night and the next morning I woke up knowing much more than anyone else did! 

I was hooked. In the next few weeks and months, I would try different ways to access other peoples mailboxes. I started with testing the default password in those who I thought were least likely to have changed it. It worked and I felt like an addict who just received his fix. I read about personal problems. Letters to their loved ones. Company gossip and speculations. I knew about their personal problems, financial problems, relationship issues, company issues. Hell, I even knew their flights, banks, and passport details! 

When I had gone through much of them. I went a step further and used my administrator privileges to directly access the other mailboxes. This unfortunately had to be done during work, so I had to be extra cautious. By then, the thrill of getting caught was part of the entertainment. 

After a while I realized how addicted I was to it. Everyday I would read their emails after work and every morning I'd know a little bit more about them. Until one day, I woke up and realized what I was doing was wrong! I stopped. I fought my urges to read their emails and for the most part succeeded but knowing access was easy, I then proceeded to find an excuse and do a company wide change of password. This happened as planned and slowly I started to lose my urges. 

Did I tell anybody about what I had read? No, thankfully not. My interest in it was not to make it public but rather knowing about their lives gave me, I suppose, a sense of superiority. Do I regret doing it? Perhaps, but I cannot say if I would not do it again. In the same way, I cannot say that if it had come to a situation where divulging this information would have saved my ass, then I might have. 

I am sorry if that went on for a bit. But it is what leads me to my question. The amount of information that an IT professional is privy to is astounding. While a lot of this is covered by company confidentiality agreements etc. what I do with the personal information of the employees in their emails is not. Considering the amount of people who are socially active at work via various methods, one can quite literally know them better than their loved ones do. 

Would I have adhered to code of professional responsibility? Yes, I would like to think so. It would have been etched into my memory by teachers from day one. I would have respected the code and feared the repercussions of my actions. 

But, heh, who knows .....

(i.e. we are in a tiny room with two beds and two desks.) We boh work M-F 8am-5pm. I am a night owl, and he is not. My problem is, is that he wants me to go bed at the same time as him (10pm) and I usually stay up until around 2am. During the time he is sleeping I do everything I can to please him. I use headphones, I turn my computer screen away from his bed and try to make no sound at all. 

He just now asked me to leave our room because the light of my laptop on half brightness angled away from him is making it so he cannot sleep. I feel like I am doing all I can to accommodate him, but he is asking too much. I feel like it is my room too and I should be able to quietly browse facebook/reddit in my bed before I go to sleep as long as I am my computer is on mute and I am not making any noise.

umzgk,2,2012-06-05,What the hell is my friend's deal? Narcissism? Entitlement? Douche-baggery?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/umzgk/what_the_hell_is_my_friends_deal_narcissism/,"I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself. 

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day. 

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases. 

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement. 

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort. 

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him. 

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort FOR WHATEVER FUCKING REASON to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.  

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend. 

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl infront of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.  

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous bullshit, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charasmatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember. 


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to always blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here. 

EDIT: Name's removed

EDIT:

TL;DR - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. "

umb7m,11,2012-06-05,Need ideas for Linux server admin internship project.,scarecrow365,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/umb7m/need_ideas_for_linux_server_admin_internship/,"tl;dr: Title says it all.

I am currently in college and completing the internship requirement for my major (IST). I work for the Network Engineering department on campus, and have been given free reign by my boss to pick an internship project that interests me. His stance on internships is using them as learning experience in a field that you are passionate about, that will not only give you tons more experience in it but also as something that will boost my hire-ability and resume, as well as create good documentation that can be used later to help others.

So far I have settled on something having to with Linux server administration. I work with this kind of stuff on a daily basis and I find it very interesting. I am currently in charge of our Nagios servers, as well as handling the occasional DNS or DHCP request. We are a huge Cisco/Linux shop (mostly Redhat based distros). I am turning to you /r/sysadmin for some more ideas. What would be a good project for me to work on? I'm open to just about anything."

Today is my first day at my summer internship, and my assigned project is to review the current data/information storage system (a local drive) and see what are possible alternatives (dedicated server, cloud system) and compare these alternatives with the current system. I am extremely uninformed about this topic, and if anyone can point me in a direction where I can get some information (preferably an online source), I would really appreciate it.

I am interning at a small law firm with 5 employees. The size of the business, the costs, and the efficacy are the biggest concerns.

Thanks Techsupport."

[What It takes to be a Journalist according to Fox News?  Is fox news a legitimate news channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w93ug?context=5)|""FNC is always looking for talented individuals who can wear many different hats"" (writer, editor, etc..)  Fox is legit. You may not always agree with how they present their news, but they know their audience well.  
[I feel like ""they know their audience well"", is not a good thing for a news channel...what i mean is they shouldnt care about their audience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wberr?context=5)|News is a product that needs to be sold. You need people to watch your channel to make money. You need to know your audience so you can tailor your broadcast to what they're interested in or they won't watch and you won't make money. 
[No no no no no!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|Capitalism controls everything. Papers and stations are shutting down everyday. Why? Nobody buys them or watches them anymore. Without money, the business doesn't exist. Ideally, there would be no bias in news. While Clinton was in office CNN became known as the Clinton News Network...
[The news is not a freaking ""product""! That's like if your apartment building was on fire somebody knocked on your door and said ""hey I got a product to sell you it's information regarding your apartment… Do you want to buy it?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|It happens. it's the nature of the beast. if you don't get it or understand this you're either an idealistic journalism student or just completely ignorant of the way the business works.
[In theory The news should be valuable and TRUTHFUL reporting about what's really going on in the world… It shouldn't be propaganda that is ""tailored"" massaged and perverted to make the target audience feel better about themselves.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|Ok, so if that's true how to wire services like the Associated Press make money because their wires tend to be fair and balanced and free of bias? Because it's a subscription service that other outlets pay to use.
[Good Lord! When even the journalists have been so corrupted by the corporate mindset it's no wonder the modern state of journalism is what it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbo54?context=5)|I can't stress enough that I believe a hundred percent to be well informed, you can't trust one news source. Read several and draw your own conclusions. 
[Do you believe this is how the news *should* be done, or are you just ""reporting"" on how it's done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdft7?context=5)|Definitely not how it should be done. 
[Why does the Fox News Channel have so many commercials for""erectile dysfunction""drugs like Viagra and Levitra? I mean, it seems like every other commercial is for male impotence treatment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9az3?context=5)|The audience is conservative (old rich white dudes). 
[What are your personal political views? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w95yv?context=5)|Ok, I'll just come out an admit it... In college I was conservative. It took moving to NYC and working at Fox before I re-examined some of my viewpoints. I would say I'm unaffiliated with any party, but if I must choose, I would consider myself liberal. 
[Did your time at Fox News inform your transition from conservative to liberal? If so, how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9rrs?context=5)|I sort of answered this a little further down. The short version is, I got tired of drinking the kool-aid. 
[How did fox effect your political views and how did your views effect your working for fox. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wey5e?context=5)|I considered myself conservative when I started working there. After awhile, I started looking at things differently. I no longer agreed with certain ideals that I had before. There were a couple of WTF moments. Remember all the controversy Fox caused over the new Muppets movie? There were instances like that. 
[What was this muppet controversy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wobu7?context=5)|[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/30/muppets-diss-fox-news-in-response-anti-oil_n_1241199.html)
[Is everyone at fox news republican? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wa0hh?context=5)|Very few of them were actually republican. 
[How do writers go against their political beliefs for a pay check? don't they know there is an unfortunate numbers of americans that believe everything fox tells them and vote biased off this info. i could sell lies all day if it was making me rich i guess, but i would feel like an asshole doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waqtn?context=5)|I kinda compared this to working on a septic tank in a comment below. And sadly, there is no getting rich from it, and I did feel like an asshole. 
[Current journalism under-grad at Mizzou here, I have three questions for you. What advice would you give to a young person entering you're field of work in the next year? second, given the bias in news programs now-a-days and 24 hour news channel's constant need for material, do you think the role of verification still exists in modern day journalism? And lastly where do you see the future of the industry going? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wap1j?context=5)|Advice -- it's never too late to change your major. I ""retired"" from the business and am back in school getting a second degree in something totally unrelated. But if you insist on being a journalist, make sure you have a portfolio or tape of your work you've done at school or as part of an internship. I can't stress the importance of an internship enough. Don't have your heart set on one particular job. Expand your skills set so you can be a jack of all trades. You may want to be a reporter, but you might have to work as an assignment desk editor for a while. Don't turn down any chances to learn something new. When I started, although I was working primarily with a paper, I was going out with the local tv news crew learning how to shoot and edit video. That progressed to me being called to shoot a story if we were lacking photogs or reporters for whatever reason. I made myself a great tape that way. If you write, keep EVERYTHING.
 |The role of verification still exists to some degree, but it's a little loose. You may read or hear the words ""We're getting reports of suchandsuch.."" That's news talk for ""This might be going on but we don't have any concrete proof. We'll let you know for sure when we find out, but we wanted to let you know in case it is true so we can later say we brought it to your attention first.""
 |I was a little burnt out and jaded, so my view on the future of the business is bleak. That's another reason why I left it all behind. Shady things go on sometimes. People are being laid off left and right, more people are turning to the web for news so advertisers are leaving tv and print which leads to budget cuts. The business is changing, but it's always going to exist in some shape or form. 
[If so few of the employees were true conservatives, how did they reconcile their beliefs with the ""slant"" Fox news has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It's like working on a busted septic tank.. you just hold your breath, wade through the shit, and get your work done. Just about every show has a production meeting. During the meeting stories would be pitched and how each segment would be presented would be discussed. Often there were eye rolls and audible sighs, but we knew what was expected of us and we just did it.
[Also, how did the employees view the reputation of fox news (i.e. its a punchline for half the country\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It varies. Many employees were proud to work there. Fox is the number one news source and has been since it started. We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters. Others were self deprecating and joined in on the jokes, and some were ashamed of themselves and the work they were doing.
[I find that many people involved with journalism tend to give it a sacred quality of sorts. They tend to think that the country is ""owed"" solid journalism, and that a good journalism serves an important function in any free society.  Were there still people like that at Fox, or does everyone's idealism die out after a time? Did anyone ever fight the direction a story was going to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wand7?context=5)|Absolutely there were people who thought their jobs were ""sacred."" You'd think they were curing cancer or something, and these were the people who were the worst to work for and with. Amazing how we could fit so many people into the newsroom with all the egos taking up a lot of free space.  Many people lost their idealism. Myself included. At some point a lot of us had some eye opening experience that made us look around and think ""this is total bullshit.""
[This is interesting. Where/who did the 'angles' come from? Are the producers ever keyed in to the GOP's official talking points of the day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wf68p?context=5)|We know everybody's talking points. Usually before a politician (Republican or Democrat) was going to make an announcement or give a speech, we had a good idea what was going to be said. You'll hear intros to that kind of story kinda like this ""The president is expected to talk about his plan for job creation today...""
[*We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters.*  Ah, the old argumentum popularum. Did it ever occur to you that journalists at actual news organizations (not the propaganda mill you worked at\) take legitimate pride in their work and don't have to compromise their beliefs or ethics just to keep their jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wb6yu?context=5)|Name a valid actual news organization. 
[What was your eye opening experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whkuh?context=5)|Mine came when somebody very close to me was killed in Iraq. He had about a month to go before he came home. He left behind a young son who would really never get to know how awesome his dad was. I was in the editing room working on a package about how everything was just peachy keen in job related news when I got the call. 
[New York Times. L.A. Times. NBC News. ABC News. CBS News. Reuters. AP. Financial Times. Le Monde. Der Spiegel. Newsweek. Wall Street Journal (except the opinion page\). Shall I go on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbcuy?context=5)|Bless your heart. Did you know Wall Street Journal is part of the News Corp family. Fox is News Corp. NY Times, ABC, NBC and reuters have been racked with scandals throughout the years. We weren't allowed to use Reuters sources for quite some time because of the erroneous reporting (and this was before I started at Fox and was working local gigs). I would consider AP to be the most reliable of all the ones you've listed. 
[I think you missed the point about the network fabricating a story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjl1j?context=5)|I was asked about a specific incident, and I answered regarding that incident. I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty, we've never created a scene to make a story. 
[Did you know any of the TV hosts? is Glenn Beck as annoying in real life as he is on TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9aoh?context=5)|I know many of them even though I didn't work exclusively on their shows. I can't speak for Glenn Beck, but funnily enough a couple of the nicest guys were Hannity and Huckabee. 
[Have you met O'Reilly? He seems like one of the more laid back and humorous personalities, considering his various Daily Show/SNL appearances. But then again, the ""we'll do it live!"" video would show otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wd24g?context=5)|I've met him several times, and I plead the 5th. 
[Hannity? Nice? Huh. He always seemed like an arrogant little prick to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4weipx?context=5)|Keep in mind this is tv, like any other tv, on camera personas can be totally different than off camera. 
[In what particular ways are you not the mole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w97m0?context=5)|My name is not Joe and I've never set foot in the Gawker HQ. I've never sold anyone information about any of my former employers, nor do I have plans to do so. Plus, I'm too lazy to write a book.
[So you aren't going to tell us about sub par bathrooms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wape9?context=5)|He used the bathroom on the floor where all the offices of the talent were located. The ones in the newsroom were actually much better!
[Did they ask you to sign a gag order or anything along those lines when you quit? I saw Outfoxed too, and I think a couple of the people that spoke in it had to. I can't recall if this was because they got fired, or just because they left the company. I just found it interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wa1sb?context=5)|On my last day, I had an exit interview with HR. I had to hand in my ID badge (which also served as a key card), and I remember signing something confirming that I was leaving on my on free will, that I met with HR and they explained to me termination of benefits and things like that. I don't remember signing a non-disclosure agreement. It's possible that I may have, but I left on good terms and my permanent record there says I'm allowed to be re-hired.
 |I know a couple of people that were asked to go that had to sign forms. I also know a man who was part of the Outfoxed documentary. He used to hang out in one of the nearby bars that was frequented by employees. He would try to get us to talk to him about what was going on because he wanted to write a book. Fox knew all about that. We weren't allowed to talk to him, and I don't think anybody ever had a fuck to give for his book anyway. 
[You were not allowed to talk to him? That's illegal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whrmk?context=5)|We never got a memo saying ""Don't take to the creepy guy at the pub or you'll be fired."" We werent allowed to talk about the company when money was involved. The guy didn't have enough of his own stories, so he would try to get us to talk, so he could finish his book and sell it. It wasn't exactly a secret, what he was doing either. 
[That is also illegal.  Surprising you didn't know that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjms1?context=5)|I've worked for many companies who didn't allow employees to ""sell"" information. I didn't think it was a big deal, and I never felt my rights were violated, and I don't care enough to sue.
[Why did you reconsider your political beliefs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9e6j?context=5)|Well, there were lots of little reasons... I'll just say I got tired of drinking the kool-aid.
 |You know the old saying that if you knew what went into sausage and how it was made, you'd never want sausage again? I made a lot of sausage during my time there. 
[Can you give us some examples of the sausage-making that turned you off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9k6p?context=5)|Well... When the economy started to tank while Bush was in office and all the other news channels were talking about how we were going into a recession and it might be another great depression, we had to show things were not-so-bad. For example, when the housing market bubble burst and foreclosures were happening left and right, I wrote a story that went a little something like, ""Housing prices are at an all time low and it's a good time to buy!"" When the market tanked- ""Cheap stocks to buy now!"" and countless stories about why we needed to invade Iraq. 
[If your story didn't approach the situation from the angle they wanted to frame it in would it get cut, or edited or what? What would they say if you tried to do a story in an angle they didn't like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4weibf?context=5)|It would usually just get edited ( a little re-wording here and there). Stories would only be cut as a time management issue, if we were running over time, we'd slide the story into another show or broadcast hour. 
[Do you ever feel embarrassed to tell people where you worked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcpxs?context=5)|Ha!Ha! This is an awesome question. Yes. At home (in the south), if people asked where I worked I told them because I knew they'd be impressed (bless their hearts). In NYC, when somebody asked what I did for a living I would say ""Oh, I work in journalism."" That would usually end the conversation. If they pressed me and asked where I would say Fox, and 9 times out of 10 they assumed I meant the Fox 5 (a local channel), and I would let them assume because a lot of New Yorkers enjoyed watching the Fox 5 morning program. They would ask me a lot about Ernie Anastos, and I would say he was awesome and fun to work with although I had never laid eyes on him in my life. 
[How is fox not a valid oranization ? Hollaback just cause you don't agree with their opinons don't attack the guy. And if you really wanna get into a flame war allmost all major news orgs are slanted. He is just telling his story, get off his ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc8n4?context=5)|Thanks for that, and you're right. Nearly all media have a slant. Let's say the stock market is crashing..again.. Fox uses this story to tell you why it's the perfect time to buy stock (because the prices are all so cheap!) They're right. The prices are cheap. I've used this phrase before, Fox is telling the same story **with their version of the truth**. MSNBC, CNN, Headline News consistently lose to Fox in the ratings. Why? Because their audiences are mostly liberal and the liberal viewers are split among three networks. Somebody should wise up and start another conservative news outlet to finally give Fox some competition and maybe, just maybe, dethrone them.
 |(I use the big three networks as examples because those are the most I'm familiar with)
[How does it feel, working for the corporation that canceled Firefly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdcqs?context=5)|It's also the corporation that brought you the Simpsons and Futurama. 
[It cancelled Firefly, Arrested Development and Futurama.  Unforgivable crimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wkxbw?context=5)|It's making Arrested Development into a movie!
[Hourly? That sucks. Is that normal for TV journalists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4way6g?context=5)|Depends on the position. The production assistant position was hourly. When I became a writer, I was given the option of being salaried or hourly. I chose to remain an hourly employee because I could make more money annually with all the overtime. This check was clearly from a slow news week. 
[I once saw a facebook post from fox news linking to an article on their site about all of the Christian persecution is the middle east, with a couple jabs about it happening in america.  The next post linked to a story about ""bizarre weather,"" going on all over america, but the storms didn't even really seem all that wild. Tornados in the bible belt, hurricane in the gulf, thunder storms in cali....  To me, it seemed calculated and hugely manipulative. Do you this level of manipulation is something Fox News is capable of pulling off intentionally? Or am I just being paranoid? Would they really use scare tactics like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcvyd?context=5)|They don't have to do much manipulating. Most of Fox News viewers and readers are conservative, live in the bible belt, and are crazy religious. They throw the bait, and the fish come to the surface.  The Fox Nation site, on the other hand, well... that's an entirely different beast. It was just starting when I was leaving. That's...that's.... there are no words for what it is. It scares me. 
[Please tell us more about the Fox Nation site! I want to know how they come up with the bullshit they put on there! A conservative fellow told me he read a story that some democrats flew a flag with Obama's face on it, he said he knew it was true because there was a picture... I said pictures can lie, there's such a thing as photoshop. He said, Fox Nation would never do that... But would they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wewkj?context=5)|I have no words. I can't speak with any certainty but I believe it was created by the web department. I'm not sure what the role of it is or should be except to piss people off. I can't even begin to guess what goes on behind the scene. 
[What's your current line of work? If you left the newsmedia industry, are you ever going to go back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|I'm working in a business related field in an entry level position. I've returned to school to get a second degree so I can advance.
[With all the (perhaps appropriate\) disdain for Fox News among most young people, are you worried that it will actually be a hindrance on your resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|Not worried at all. There have been times when I applied for jobs (like my current one) and worried that the hiring manager wouldn't believe I worked at a major news organization and now am applying for grunt work. The mole said he couldn't get a job because of Fox. I know plenty of people that now work for ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and Headline news who got their start at Fox.
[What exactly made you ""stop drinking the kool aid""? Expanding: what issues, circumstances, or events led you to examine your beliefs and shift your social values away from conservatism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc7y6?context=5)|I used this example earlier about how when the economy started to tank and the housing market burst, I had to write a story that went something like, ""Housing prices are at an all time low! We'll tell you why is a good time to buy!"" It **was** true, though, home prices were indeed at an all time low because of all the foreclosures and newly homeless people. It started as little things like that, but later there were stories about which I had to write an ""alternate view"" that I thought were just ridiculous.
[Are there any more upcoming Obama attack ads or stories that you know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9gpr?context=5)|I don't work there anymore. But it is an election year, so.....
 |I will say this, I honestly don't believe Fox considered it to be an attack ad when they aired it. They put a bunch of stats and silly graphics to scary music to present their version of the truth. 
[Where do you get your news from now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waohc?context=5)|Mostly online from pulse, fark.com, drudge, or google news. I don't watch a lot of network/cable news. Not even local news.
[What do you think of the scandals in Britain and do you believe it may effect Fox News](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4waohc?context=5)|When I first heard the news, I just kind of chuckled to myself. No, I don't think Fox will feel the consequences of it unless there's some sort of take over, but I'm sure there are plans in place to keep Fox News going if Murdoch was ousted.
[Do you feel you did the right thing working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|Do I feel I did the right thing by working there? I'm not sure what this means. Did I feel I had a message to spread? No. I applied for a job at Fox because it was my goal, as a young, naive journalist, to work for a major network one day. At the time, I was a fan of Fox News. It was relatively new and different then than it is now. I had no ulterior motive for working there.
[Do you feel you should have left sooner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I worked with a lot of good people who had no control over the content that was aired. If they didn't like it, why didn't they leave? Well, news jobs are difficult to come by, even at that level. Most people felt stuck, but they still came to work everyday and did their assigned duties to the best of their abilities.
[How do you sleep at night knowing the strife and misinformation your actions have spread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I'm not doing this to bash my former employer, and I won't. Did I agree with everything? No. Does anybody agree with everything at their place of work? No. Office politics is everywhere.
[How long were you struggling with the decision to leave before you finally decided enough was enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjb1?context=5)|I left because my ideals, priorities, and goals changed. Do I wish I had left sooner? There were times I considered quitting because I felt I was overlooked for a promotion and for other office bullshit. I think I left when the time was finally right for me.
[Well, regardless of what you think, your work definitely helped to set the limits on conversation in many families and helped to bring this country to the brink we're at now.

I didn't do anything to *force* people to think one way or the other.
[So in essence you're the guy who goes to a business (as a contractor or permanent employee\) and outlines what is worth their money and what isn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjjz5?context=5)|Not really, there are many careers in financing. I just watch where money goes and decide which risks/investments the company should take. 
[Thank you for doing this AMA because bias in media is always a hotly debated subject and as a man that cannot stand either side, yet due to some of my beliefs I am categorized as more conservative, I would like to ask you: As a journalist, what source would you recommend as the most unbiased and best way to get news, also was there anything that you did while working for Fox News that you actually enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wfkq3?context=5)|The Associated Press is a good source. Usually, it's just straight reporting. I also like NPR, and as Bellika pointed out its good to go to several sources and draw your on conclusions.
[Tl/dr: best unbiased news source and did you do anything you enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wfkq3?context=5)|I like most of the people I worked wirh. Also it was fun working on entertainment segments. I got to meet a lot of celebrities. 
[Thanks for the info, and also please don't hate all those that are conservative just because of what you experienced, unlike people from Fox News most of us with conservative views do not act like asses and are reasonable people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wn9hj?context=5)|I don't hate anybody, really.. except for maybe assholes.
[From your time working in the field, do you believe that Fox News operates on a much different level internally than CNN or MSNBC, or is it just a different audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbsvt?context=5)|They're all very similar in structure. There's a president and VP of content followed by executive producers, senior producers, associate producers, writers, bookers, researchers, editors and assistants. How information is delivered and the audience are the main differences. 
[Can you elaborate on those differences a bit more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wc62m?context=5)|[This](http://www.theoutdoorstrader.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=104406&amp;d=1338315595) is the best example I have ever seen.
[I remember watching a documentary in school about Fox News that showed how reporters in certain circumstances were instructed by a memo from high-up to frame a particular story in a certain way - often anti-Democratic/liberal - so as to directly cater to the Republican side of the matter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9nkw?context=5)|We are not *instructed* to be anti-anything by anyone. However, we cater to the audience. The audience isn't watching CNN or MSNBC, why? Because they don't like how those other channels present news, so we presented news in a different manner.
[Yes, Outfoxed was the one.  So if it was just catering to the audience there must have been some ""I can't believe I'm writing this"" moments on the production side?  I can imagine that would be frustrating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9svt?context=5)|Yep. See my ""sausage making"" comment below in response to a question from KatyRPishere and Catesby.
[ ... so we presented news in a different manner.  As a *journalist*, doesn't this kinda sound weird to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4walai?context=5)|Journalism is just a different kind of story telling. There are two sides to every story. We told the other side. 
[If presented the opportunity, would you return to Fox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbca2?context=5)|I had the opportunity. I didn't.

Colbert/stewart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wefti?context=5)|I really enjoy the Daily Show and Colbert Report. I had the honor of meeting Colbert several times. He's awesome and the people that work with him are super talented. I told him I wanted a job. He asked if I was any good and told me to send a resume. I didn't. I regret that decision. 
[How did you get a job there/internship there? Also, is Bill O'Reilly a nice guy off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4we16w?context=5)|I got the job there by applying via foxnews.com At the bottom of the page they have a listing of current openings. I didn't know anyone there, and applied on a whim. I had an impressive resume for somebody still relatively new to the business. I went through a few rounds of phone interviews and had to take a current events test before I was made an offer. Writers/producers were required at the time to take a writing test.
[What about my second question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wehbm?context=5)|Silence speaks volumes, am I right?
[Have you seen the movie ""Network"", and if you have, what is your opinion on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wdjty?context=5)|We actually watched it in my Intro to Broadcasting class. I don't know anyone who's killed himself over ratings, but working in news can be a soul crushing experience.
[Do you think Journalism is still a career worth pursuing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4we76l?context=5)|Not really, but I'm a little bitter and jaded. Some of my former co-workers still work in news and enjoy it, others do it because they don't know anything else. 
[How were the HR practices by way of movement or promotion within the company.  I.E. were you able to move around laterally within the organization provided you met the required competencies as opposed to the company making outside hires?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcnj2?context=5)|I think there were more outside hires for several reasons -- most of the positions that became available were entry level production assistant positions (because people would be promoted or just leave after a while). If a new show was launching, Fox would use a few in house producers and then hire writers and such from outside. Also, to keep costs low, instead of promoting someone from within and having to give them a raise, they'd hire from the outside and lowball salary.
[I've been around politics and news north of the border so I find the confluence of hiring practices between newsmakers and policy makers interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcnj2?context=5)|I can tell you this much, it's not easy to be promoted from within. You have to work your ass off. Some people try really hard for a while and then burn out, and keep their shitty jobs. It can be a soul crushing experience. 
[In your opinion, is Fox more concerned with reporting the news or viewership and ratings? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcngg?context=5)|They aren't concerned at all about ratings. They kill the competitors and it's been that way since they started. You might see ridiculous adds like ""11 years of being your number one news channel."" They have worked to broaden the viewership demographics. They've got the lock on the old white man market, but increasingly try to gain the viewership of the oft-coveted 18-35 demo. They work hard to ""improve"" (for lack of a better word) programming to gain younger viewers.
[What was your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w95cy?context=5)|I started as a production assistant (worked with the video department, graphics, and ran scripts). I was promoted a couple of times, and left as a writer. 
[What kind of writer? Politics,Sports,Technology,etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9933?context=5)|General stuff. The newsroom isn't split into different departments. We don't have a sports department to write sports stories or a political department to write political bits. All writers must be up to date on current events and on-going stories. I've written lots of stuff from bears falling out of trees, the market ""crashing,"" and bombings in the Middle East.
[Do you currently work as a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wblmx?context=5)|I may do some freelance work from time, but I no longer consider myself a journalist. Currently, I work in a business related field and I've returned to school to get a second degree to advance.

ulq7p,6,2012-06-05,Need advice: brother just came out of the closet to me and seems depressed. I don't know what to do.,Dontknowwhattodo987,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ulq7p/need_advice_brother_just_came_out_of_the_closet/,"Reddit, please please please give me advice. I don't know what to do and I don't know where to post this. This is so long and I don't know how to condense it. I just got off the phone with my younger brother (20 years old) and can't stop crying. I know he needs lots of counseling and therapy, but there's no way we can afford it, nor is he comfortable opening up to someone in general.


My brother has always been quiet and always keeps to himself. He has friends, but it doesn't seem like he gets super close to them. Today, he told me he was gay. I have no problem with, but I'm worried that my family will since most everyone else other than my immediate family lives in Asia. My parents will be somewhat uncomfortable, but I think will eventually come to be okay with it. We're not very close with our parents, which also leads to many problems. Before I talk about that, I want to write out what happened today.

He's been hooking up with guys that he's been meeting through on an app. He started dating one of the guys exclusively who is supposedly a sex addict. This guy told my brother the urges stopped because he met him. I don't know how long this has been going on for, but my brother said that this guy has met up with others from the app but ""hasn't done anything."" My brother doesn't know what to do. Gay or straight, it's too suspicious to me. My brother doesn't want to leave this guy because he's the first person he's opened up to ever and especially doesn't want to leave him if he's a sex addict (I don't know the dude, but it sounds like this guy is guilt tripping my brother into staying with him). I told my brother to leave him and nurse his heartbreak by getting outside, blocking this guy on facebook, hitting the gym (typical reddit breakup advice). My brother seems to be apprehensive about breaking it off with him. The guy told him that he stopped himself from doing anything with the person that he met up with because he thought of my brother. I think fucking bullshit. The intention was there. How do I get him to stay away from this guy?

I asked him if he's gotten tested and he said yes, so I think he's clean. When I told him to go to the gym, he just said that he just really doesn't want to be around people. It makes me so sad, I don't know what to say or do. I want him to be safe and I want him to be happy.

He's an only child and is the only boy in the family. I knew he always kind of felt this way, but today was the first time he's voiced it. My parents have always had higher expectations for him because he's the lone male child, and I don't know how to change that. He knows my parents care about him, but doesn't really feel it. He can't stand being around them and he wants to move out ASAP. We have a rough relationship with our parents and it's not because they're horrible parents, but they don't know how to show affection. Their way of showing us they care is by being on our cases all the time. I moved away for college and am now living in San Francisco doing an internship. They love us and we understand that, but there is a language barrier so it's hard for us to communicate. The kids don't really speak Mandarin, whereas my parents don't speak English that well.

My brother never comes out to eat dinner with the family, never really talks to anyone in our family. My parents are very asian and used to spank us when we were little. It stopped a long time ago after they realized that it's not acceptable in America. My brother said he's getting flashbacks to when they used to spank us. It seems like he's getting a lot of abandonment feelings and I want him to talk to someone, but he's not comfortable with talking to people and opening up. He's never really been very close to anyone, has always kept to himself. How do I get him to talk to someone? Do I refer him to LGBT for support? We have so many family affection issues that don't have to do with him being gay. How do I fix this? My parents can' afford counseling, I wouldn't even know how to bring it up.

My little sister is also young and I don't want her to go through the same family problems that we both grew up in. I consider myself a strong and secure person, but I think it's because I've always had a very close-knit group of friends.

I think my brother is thinking about suicide. I'm trying to be there as much as I can without physically being there. He didn't tell me anything, but I've had a friend commit suicide and this seems too similar. Reddit, I'm sorry this is so long, but can you help me with any advice please?

EDIT: He just said he's going to a gun range tomorrow. That's okay right? It'll help him get his mind off things? This makes me really nervous for some reason, even though I probably shouldn't be."

I was originally going to post this in /r/questions however I figured redditors here would have a better understanding of the subject. 

Long story short, I'm a business student looking for internships in marketing and I see many that require knowledge in Graphic Design, however I am unsure of what specific skills are required. 

**What would you consider neccesary to be able to claim knowledge of intermediate graphics design skills, compared to a basic or advanced level?**

If you want to answer my bonus question, **what is a good way to improve upon my graphic design skills.** I consider myself computer fluent (like most redditors) and can do the basics with photoshop and could probably navigate my way through some graphic design software with some practice, assuming it is not meant for users with a higher skill level.

The knowledge I have is introductory Circuits, Computer Systems, and C Programming (Physics 2, Intro to Computer Systems and Hardware, and Intro to Programming respectively.)

I was wondering if you guys have any ideas for hands-on projects to launch me intro my next semester at school, where I'll be doing all ECE classes. Some things I had in mind would be; Straight up furthering my programming knowledge, picking up something like an Arduino and trying to program that to do different things (need more inspiration here if this is a good route), or just picking up some reading on Circuits and getting ahead on the material.

Best case scenario, I'm doing something hands-on, and ultimately have something to show for it. Some early experience that simulates something I might be doing in an Internship (a ship that has not yet sailed for me, but working on it.)

I'd appreciate any input, and Cheers!"

Since I've started I have been programming from essentially 9-5, with an hour for lunch.

I must add that I'm actually enjoying working here because I am learning a lot and the people are cool, and so far I don't mind programming all day.

My question is, is this a common occurrence? Are people expected to literally program for 7 hours a day? Is this a recipe for burning out if it continues?"
unxaj,0,2012-06-06,"Reddit, has your life been rewarded with little work and feel that it really is unfair to other people?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/unxaj/reddit_has_your_life_been_rewarded_with_little/,"So growing up i was always a c/d student. My parents always told me that I wasn't going to make it in life because I just didn't try hard enough and did not care about school. Well after I graduated(2.1 gpa) I started at the local community college. I was working for a car wash and knew I wanted to work in computers (networking or something). 

Well I found a job and it happened to be where my dad worked. He is an engineer and the job was an IT helpdesk position (internship) So I applied and gave him my resume to hand it to them IT team. They interviewed me and must have liked me gave me a job. I was 18 making 12 bucks an hour and felt like a boss. Fast forward 2 years of basically browsing the net and doing some basic help desk duties I found another job making a few dollars more an hour. This job was a hardware manager and eventually full system admin position. 

I hardly did any work other than what had to be done. I got laid off from there after multiple rounds. It was my turn to go. I stayed unemployed for 6 months didn't even look for a job. The last week of my unemployment I'm like oh crap need a job. Interviewed at 3 places and one of them called me back and offered me a job that was better and making more than I was previously.  So i started immediately.

Now fast forward a few months and i'm offered another job making 20% more than the job i took so I told my them and they matched almost all at about 18% so I stayed. I am currently still working here and support everything but I keep everything fixed so there is nothing for me to do. 

I don't make a lot now 50-55k. But having no degree and being 26 I feel like it just isn't fair that I haven't even tried and it feels like it has been handed to me. 

I see people all the time working 2 jobs just trying to make ends meet and the work they are doing is 100 times harder than what i do. 

How has life been unfair in a positive way for you?

**TL;DR: No college degree 26 making over 50k/year and don't do anything at work. Never tried hard at anything.**"
unhdc,5,2012-06-06,Side Projects,danjam11565,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/unhdc/side_projects/,"So, to preface this, I'm only a rising sophmore in college studying comp. sci, and am probably getting myself a bit psyched out over nothing, but as I look into career options for CS, I keep seeing sites like GitHub mentioned, as well as the importance of having various examples of code to show off during interviews, like writing an app, or something similar. Do people have code from classes in cases like this, or do people really spend tons of their free time writing programs?

I'm just kind of wondering, is it realistic for companies to expect students fresh out of college to have written a bunch of code on their own time? There's always code from classes, but the way it sounds sometimes makes it seem like you have to spend your weekends coding just to get a job. 

I know that elite companies like Google will expect stuff like this, but do more average good companies, or do they understand not everyone (even good coders) codes their own programs during their free time for fun?  


Edit: I want to add that I know employers expect some sort of experience, and I definitely plan on applying for a lot of internships over the next few years, but do they also look for independent projects as a neccessity? "

[Was that really Dog the Bounty Hunter? If so, how did you get him and do you have any crazy bounty hunting stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlpip?context=5)|That was Dog!  We lucked out in getting him on board.  The director of the film, Alan Deutsch is also a producer and director on Dog's show so he pulled a few strings and got The Dog to come out to Austin, TX and do a cameo for a day.  He was incredibly nice to everyone on the cast and crew and was adamant about us getting exactly what we wanted out of him.  And he loves Pepsi.  A lot.
[What kind of Pepsi? Also, did anybody offer him ice with his Pepsi? If so, did he think they were referring to crack cocaine and give them a speech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd25?context=5)|Just regular Pepsi in a bottle.  Everyone knew better than to offer His Majesty, Dog the Bounty Hunter ice.  
[Any nudity in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmxtc?context=5)|Abso-lutely.
[Will it be on Netflix in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlqd2?context=5)|It will be.  Sometime this summer.

[Ok, I'll bite. What's the name of the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlhld?context=5)|""Austin High"".  It's listed on VOD services as ""420 Austin High""

It's more of a broad comedy that just so happens to include a lot of stoned-ness.  More Mel Brooks than Cheech and Chong.
[Any advice for independent filmmakers now that you've completed a feature film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm84p?context=5)|Don't shrug off post-production costs.  During filming, we were always running into things that cut into our post budget and we did what we had to do to just finish the film.  Then we got to post and had very little budget for editing, sound mix/design and music.  That's the real reason the film took so long to complete.
 |Also, next time I'm going to write a more simple story that takes place in only a few locations with a few characters.  I loved having all of our actors and set pieces but it was a beast to coordinate and pull off.
 |Also part deux, don't be a dick to people.  They're working for cheap or free to work in the film industry.  Be nice.
[I would have edited and mixed your audio and did the sound design for free. Independent artists need to help each other out and support the arts. Maybe next time, champ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wvg77?context=5)|You're a badass.  And I may just be in contact in the near future.  :)
[Budget?  Tech stuff? Camera? Edited on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlxde?context=5)|Budget came it at around 100k.  We shot on the Canon 5D and 7Ds.  Edited on Final Cut Pro.
[How did you feel about using those cameras re battery life? I was thinking shooting on my t2 but dunno should I look around and borrow something else.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlzxx?context=5)|Battery life wasn't really an issue because so many people on set had Canon products, we always had a few spares to go around.  The issue that we kept running into was the cameras overheating.  When that happens there's nothing you can do but turn it off and wait in the 106 degree heat for it to cool down.  
[What about sound equipment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd3l?context=5)|I'm not sure of the exact brand of sound equipment.  We used both boom and lav mics and had a field mixer.  
[Interesting. I've heard of overheat problems but never had it happen myself. I had the chance to work with the 5D mk III and it's awesome as a movie camera. All the crap you have to work around with the mk II, the 7D and the T2i is totally gone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wml4t?context=5)|Yea, the mk III is a dream.  I wish we had that when we shot.  
[Did you re-dub all the audio in post production, or was there not enough time/resources/money left in the budget? Or was it a purely artistic decision? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wvjnx?context=5)|We didn't re-dub all of it, just picked up some random spots here and there that were crappy on-set dialogue.
[How stoned were you while doing the film? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlurk?context=5)|Not very.  We were pulling 16-18 hour days almost every day so things were semi-intense.  Pre and post production were a different story...

[How old are you? What made you want to become a filmmaker? What advice can you give to an aspiring script writer/filmmaker like myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnawn?context=5)|I'm 27.  I've wanted to be some kind of entertainer since I was a kid.  After realizing I couldn't break dance, I started to mess around with short comedy films around junior high time.  Since then that's pretty much all I've focused on.
 |Only advice I'd give is to write/make your films.  I spent a lot of time doing internships and working shitty jobs on set and didn't get too much out of that.  It's good to network and meet people but you'll never get the opportunity to make your films if you don't have something to show.  Plus, you'll get a lot more respect as someone who's made a film rather than someone who talks about making a film.  
[That was for show, right? You didn't actually smoke oregano...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnizn?context=5)|No we did.  It was disgusting.  Actors hated us.

[Trailer looks awesome! I think I may have to give this a watch. I've always wondered though, what is that weed substitute they use in films? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm4ko?context=5)|Here's a little vignette with our chosen method of weedery: [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/b5QWPp1tbLA)
[The trailer looks hilarious!  How long have you been into making films and what was the budget for the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlnur?context=5)|Thank you!  I've been making films since junior high, although they're pretty unwatchable now.  I guess I've been serious about filmmaking since college.  Budget was around 100k which goes pretty quickly when you start shooting a feature film.
[There are a lot of trolls on this subreddit. Not saying I don't believe you, but is there any way to prove you made the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|I'm no celebrity so no reason for me to lie, but nonetheless, I linked a picture of me in my illustrious cameo role as DJ Tinklesqueez (which can be seen for a split second in the trailer).
[Anyway, the movie looks hilarious. I've always thought what it would be like if my friends and I all ended up teaching at our old high school. It sounds like making it took much more time than you expected. What was it that made it take so long? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|Thank you! It took so long because of our restricted budget.  The whole ""fast, good or cheap and you can only pick one"" saying was very true. We had to pull in favors at every stage of production so we couldn't rightly give hard deadlines to our friends that were doing us a kindness.  We also did a shitload of test screenings to make sure that our jokes were hitting their marks.
[Would it upset you if people torrent your movie rather than paying for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|Upset is a strong word.  I would prefer that they purchase it in some form or fashion so that we can make our investor his money back and continue to make films.  BUT, if it were between not watching the film at all and torrenting it, I'd prefer people get to see it somehow.  I torrent things myself, mostly when I'm not able to find something or when the distributor withholds the release of something (GoT).  That being said, let's torrent things like Battleship and throw the indie guys a bone!
[ even torrent the movie as a measure of judging the quality of the movie before going out and purchasing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|I'm not opposed to that.  There's a lot of shit out there.
[I just smoked is this movie on Netflix, HuluPlus or some shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wloo8?context=5)|It will be on Netflix very soon.  Netflix doesn't give the best deals to the independents.
[I've always wondered how that worked. Do you get a cut for every view or is it like a renter store where they just pay a larger amount up front?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wp3cj?context=5)|No cut per views.  They basically put the film on their site with the ""save"" function on.  Then based on how many people add the film to their queue, you got one flat fee for a certain agreed-upon amount of time.  It sucks.  I'm not sure how disc rentals work on there but Instant sucks for filmmakers without an established name or marketing campaign.
[Cool movie! Or so I think from the trailer! Do you have any ideas for your next movie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmz95?context=5)|Thanks!  I do.  And it sure as hell won't take place in a high school.
[Why, what's wrong with shooting in a high school?  Any stories to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wt7qv?context=5)|Nothing wrong with it.  It was just incredibly difficult to shoot an R-rated  comedy in a state-run high school.  Then when we finally found someone cool enough to let us, there was the problem of filling it with high school aged kid extras whose parents didn't mind them being in a comedy that glamorizes drug use.  
[Hehe sounds cool, what genre?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn1b2?context=5)|Comedy/horror.
[Together? Like an Evil Dead/Army Of Darkness kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wonat?context=5)|Yea.  I pray it's in the same realm as those.
[How can i watch your movie being in the netherlands? i never used itunes and i don't plan to, any other options?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn728?context=5)|We should be on Netflix and Amazon later this summer.  Otherwise, you may have to take to the high seas...

I appreciate that but we don't have our own distribution outlet at the moment.  Amazon Instant is coming soon, as is DVD and Blu-Ray through Amazon.
[How hard is it to actually make a profit in the independent world? Any ideas for future films in the making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn9ol?context=5)|Well, this is my first foray into the feature film world but I have a lot of friends who have been in it for a while and it's pretty difficult.  The studios and distributors don't want to make or release anything that doesn't have a big name attached or is already a viable property (comic book, reboot, toy).  But, Video On Demand is changing some of that.  It's getting easier to secure a release with VOD and if the film's budget is kept low then making a profit is less daunting.  We'll see how this one goes.  It's been out on VOD for a couple of months but we haven't heard anything from the distributor about what kind of numbers it's done.  Fingers crossed.  The real goal is to just make the investor back his money so I can continue to make more films.
 |I've got a few ideas in the works.  
[How do you go about finding investors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsjah?context=5)|We actually found our investor at Burning Man.  That's a good place to start I guess.
[How did you get your start? What advice do you have for film students who are trying to follow their dreams like you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsb9b?context=5)|I got my start out of film school as a post-production dude at a video game publisher.  Did a lot of editing and a little bit of shooting.
 |Keep at it.  Get around people who know what they're doing and watch and learn.  If you want to write or direct, do that as much as humanly possible.  That's more important than going to film school.
[What was the hardest part of the shoot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm19u?context=5)|The hardest part of the shoot was just getting it all in the can.  Because of our restricted budget we had to cram in a lot of things to a short period of time.  We had about 35 locations and close to 100 featured roles and 19 days to shoot it all.  Dumb.
 |Also, there is a rally at the end of the film that was particularly hairy.  We were trying to sell it as a jam-packed, city-wide event but getting extras to come stand out in the 100+ Texas heat for no dough was difficult.  It was an exercise in camera wizardry to fill the frames with our same 50 extras.  Hope that doesn't ruin the illusion if you choose to watch the film!
[I was able to find a torrent for this surprisingly enough, but me once being an aspiring filmmaker i could not make myself do it. 10 dollars to you good sir! But for the AMA part.  How did you get started in film making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I've been making films for a good portion of my life but sort of got serious about it when I went to film school.  I made a few films during school and did a lot of internships at local production companies and on sets.  Then I broke off and did my own thing.  Started a production company called Beef &amp; Sage with a very funny man named Will Elliott, where we made a bunch of comedy shorts.  www.beefandsage.com.
[How did you keep yourself motivated in the early stages of trying to become what you are now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I just have a crippling fear of failure that my parents instilled in me at an early age and that has kept me motivated.  Also, watching funny or great films is a big inspiration to try to make great work.
[Duuude! This looks awesome!! What was your favorite part to shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wwflb?context=5)|We shot at a place called Hippy Hollow.  It's a nude beach here in Austin.  That was really fun.

Intrigued?  I think there are a enough strong female characters in the movie to even out the hyper-sexualized ones that were shown off in the trailer.
[Edit: Still looks fucking awesome, don't know why I felt the need to ask a cynical question. Just waiting for the downvotes now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsyuz?context=5)|""Dinosaur eats man, woman inherits the Earth.""
[Trailer looks great, how was it working with Dog?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wni21?context=5)|Dog was a badass.  He had just come from doing something with George Clooney (not sure what but I want to see it).  He told us a story about how he asked Clooney if he had any advice for him.  Clooney told him, ""Just go for it.""  And he definitely did.  He was at full intensity every time he was on camera and we could all tell he was having a blast.  He's a good man.
[If you had a chance to make the movie over again, what would you do differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn3k1?context=5)|I would write a more contained story that didn't take place in a high school.  We had way too many locations for our budget and securing a high school for an R-rated stoner comedy in Texas was quite difficult.  That was the only location that was really hard to lock down but oh was it hard.
 |I also wouldn't shoot in June.
[Looks like a good film to watch while baked. Is it available to watch anywhere else other than itunes?

Most of them though were paid well below the rate they deserved.  Others were paid on a deferred basis which meant half then, half if/when we  recoup our costs.  So, they were sort of taking on chance on that second half of the payment.  We did have some PAs, Grips and Extras as well that were volunteer.  The real heroes.

undhw,0,2012-06-05,Do you feel that GPA is a good indicator of a persons skill?,oshidoman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/undhw/do_you_feel_that_gpa_is_a_good_indicator_of_a/,I am a recent college graduate and I ended with a decent GPA 3.0 as an engineer. I ended up getting screwed over in a few of my classes in college so my GPA was not as high as I had hoped. Even with a year of practical intern experience I feel that it is difficult to find a job just because of my grades. A lot of my fellow classmates had the higher grades but by no means are they smarter in my opinion. Yet just because of those grades they get the jobs. Do you guys feel that a persons grades in college are more important than work experience?

However, it all seems way beyond me, I'm sitting here thinking am I ever going to know all this stuff I need to know to get a job in programming?

So I was wondering if you guys could enlighten me on whats expected when you get a first job in programming? How much do I need to know? What kind of programs should I be capable of writing? Etc. The more I know that I need to know; the sooner I can get started on teaching myself it..."

I am currently a CS undergrad, so it seemed right up my alley at the time. The posting asked for a few months of experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and a little bit of Java. Not really any problems there at all. 

The problems came when I was given my assignment. I was told that I have one month to convert a VERY dynamic flash data visualization to Javascript. I don't get any training either. I was given access to the system, and a developer's station, and that's it... So I started boning up on Javascript and some of the data libraries. Still not bad, right?

Well, I find out today (on my first week of the job), that I can't build this visualization from the ground up. They want me to look through every single Actionscript file on the old visualization and begin converting it. Unfortunately, I don't really know AS and the code is a mess. There are 8 different AS files with atleast 1000 lines in each. From what I can read, they all link out to Java commands as well (to pass data, and build stuff). This is where I am starting to get physically sick and scared. I have no idea how to read all of this Actionscript. I feel like it will take a month just to understand these files, and then it will be past the deadline and I won't even have a start.

I know this isn't really a straight forward question, as I didn't include any technical data. But how should I start something like this? Where do I begin? Does this seem like a typical thing for undergraduate Interns? Help?"

us99y,2,2012-06-08,"How do you cope with the unexpected loss of a loved 
one?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/us99y/how_do_you_cope_with_the_unexpected_loss_of_a/,"Even though it's just started, this has been a really shitty summer. At the end of May, my wife and I had to put our 20-year-old cat to sleep. Then, six days later, our 25-year-old niece died in a car accident this week.

**tl;dr**: Please just go read some other post. Right now, I'm looking for understanding and support, not half-informed, off-the-cuff comments that are only tenuously related to what I'm talking about. I'm not trying to be a douche, but I'm just not in a good place at the moment, so I'm kind of grumpy.

She was the daughter of my wife's sister, but I've known her for 11 years, now. She wasn't much younger than us (my wife is the youngest of 9 children--this niece was the same age as my younger sister), and a few years ago, she lived with us for a year while attending a local community college. She and I hung out together and became close friends. She moved away to go to a different school, but she spent a week with us in March when she had a short internship here in town.

I'm fairly introspective and self-aware, and I'd like to believe that I'm quite articulate. I'm not the stoic, emotionless kind of guy, and I'm not the type that suppresses my feelings or refuses to talk to others about them, or that can't properly express myself when talking about how I feel. On the other hand, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, either. I'm normally pretty laid-back and happy-go-lucky, and although I have a wry, sarcastic sense of humor, I prefer to look for positives or find the humor in a situation, or simply let it pass, rather than dwell on the negative. But this situation is affecting me in ways that I don't understand. It's not that I'm particularly hard-hit by it, although I'm obviously upset; it's that I'm not as distraught as I feel I should be. 

On an intellectual level, this loss occupies most of my thoughts, and I haven't gotten much work done, but if I want to, I'm able to focus on other things without obsessing over this. I'm not at the top of my game (and I'm sure that part of this is due to my current physical condition), but I don't think that I'm noticeably distracted or absent-minded, or anything like that. I've noticed that I've been occupying my time with low-priority, mid-range intelligence/focus tasks, such as beefing up the security of my home network, cleaning the house and rearranging all of the rooms, etc. To some degree, that's because I'm a little burned-out; I had paper deadlines in April and May, and then I immediately had to prepare for a professional certification exam that I sat for last week. So right now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about jumping right back into the mentally-taxing tasks (i.e., more research, writing more papers, doing edits on others and trying to get them published, etc.) that are higher on my to-do lists. But I'm also aware that I'm not able to do my best work right now, so I haven't really been trying to tackle anything too complex.

Physically, I'm fairly messed up. My back and shoulders ache like I just climbed a mountain, and I've got a constant low-grade headache--both of these show up when I'm under a lot of stress, but usually these symptoms subside a bit once I recognize them for what they are and make a conscious effort to control my stress levels. That hasn't been the case (maybe because I have no idea how to limit this kind of stress), and I have other physical symptoms that are less normal for me. I can't sleep, although not because I'm up late dwelling on things--I just can't fall asleep. Insomnia isn't uncommon for me; I usually spend at least one or two nights each week tossing and turning, and even on good nights it normally takes me about 90 - 150 minutes to fall asleep on any given night. Now I'm lucky to fall asleep at all, and when I do, I wake after an hour or two. I'm also extremely tired in the morning. I expect that's primarily because I haven't been getting nearly enough sleep, but normally, I'm a morning person, and even if I haven't had enough sleep, I'm awake once the sun comes up. Unless I'm extremely sleep-deprived, I wake naturally 15-30 minutes before my alarm goes off, and I don't feel unduly tired throughout the day; I'm starting to cross that deprivation threshold, but I've felt abnormally tired and lethargic for the past week and half (basically since we made the decision to have our cat put down). My appetite has been disrupted, to: I'm able to eat if I remember that I should, but I haven't felt hungry at all, and I've been completely uninterested in food even when I do think of it. Alternatively, I'm occasionally--but rarely--ravenously hungry. Normally, I'm somewhat of a foodie. Also, I have a sore throat, and in general, I feel like I'm coming down with something (and I probably am--not eating or sleeping isn't good for you).

Emotionally, I'm not experiencing nearly as sadness as I had expected. I've had a few moments of intense sadness, and I've cried a few times, but most of the time it's just a generalized disappointment, like something that I was really hoping for didn't work out, and I haven't decided on an alternative yet. I'm familiar with the stages of grief, and I know that they're not as linear as they seem on paper, and I'm definitely experiencing some of them, but some of what I'm feeling doesn't fit into any of the categories, and some of what did fit didn't seem particularly significant (but I didn't notice a stage for ""not complying with the stages of grief"").

I know that part of why I feel the way I do is because it hasn't fully sunk in yet. After she moved out, we only saw her a few times each year, so I didn't have the shock of going from seeing her every day to not seeing her at all. Also, I've seen photos of her car after the accident, but I haven't seen her (and won't--she's already been cremated). I'm definitely the type of person who finds some measure of closure in seeing the body. When we had our cat put to sleep, I wanted to be there in the room, partially to comfort the cat and to be sure that it was as peaceful as possible, and partially for my own peace of mind, so that my last memories of her weren't of a stranger just taking my cat into another room. But I can't have that with my niece, and I'm actually feeling a little indignant about it, even though I rationally know that (a) it wasn't possible; and (b) as an uncle that married into the family, my wants in this situation are subordinate to quite a few others. In some small way, I'm also displacing some of what I feel about the loss and putting it into that--I feel cheated because I won't be able to see her one last time, but I haven't yet reached the point where I'm confronting her death directly.

Another part of my problem is that my wife's family is much more stoic than what I grew up with. As I said earlier, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, but my family (both nuclear and extended) was usually somewhat open about their emotions when it came to grieving, and we're the type of people that copes by talking about things. My wife's family, on the other hand, is much more guarded. Neither men nor women display much emotion. I don't think it's that they think men aren't supposed to show emotion, or anything like that; it's more that they aren't comfortable with emotions--for the most part, they're not even really comfortable hugging, which makes the first 10 minutes of every holiday with my side of the family particularly awkward for my wife. But because they're they kind of people that prefer to deal with their emotions privately, my normal support-giving/getting strategy doesn't work in this situation. (However, this doesn't make me upset, or anything, other than just feeling awkward, because the things I would normally do in similar situations don't seem appropriate in this one.)

Something else that really makes this hard for me is the fact that it happened so soon after we had to put our cat to sleep. First, the kind of comforting thoughts that I've cultivated over the months, knowing for a long time that our cat would never recover don't work when applied to our niece. I feel better about the cat when I'm able to say to my wife (or to myself), ""It's okay--she was 20 years old. She had a long, full, happy life."" And our niece wasn't much older than the cat, but thinking about the fact that she was 25 isn't exactly comforting. Second, I feel bad that I've hardly about the cat, because I did like her, but because this happened so soon afterward, I'm preoccupied with thoughts of our niece. And if I *do* think about the cat, I feel bad that I'm thinking about a cat when what happened to our niece was much more tragic. And third, I still haven't recovered from the stress or sadness of losing the cat--all of those emotions have just been pushed to the side, so I alternate between feeling like those emotions are going to evaporate before I have the chance to experience them, or they'll come rushing back to me much later. In the first case, I'll feel guilty about the fact that what I felt over the loss of our cat wasn't proportionate to how much the cat meant to me. In the second case, I'll either feel like it's unreasonable to be so upset about the cat so much later--and therefore won't let myself deal with those feelings properly--or I'll be upset because I'll most likely have forgotten little things, even though I cared about the cat.

But thing that I find most difficult about everything is the fact that it happened so suddenly and unexpectedly, and that the impact is so immediate and permanent. Apart from the shock, I'm still struggling to reconcile the intellectual facts that I know to be true with the emotions that I can't predict or control. It might be ridiculous or cliché, but I have to admit that I still feel like young people are relatively invincible--nothing seriously bad happens to us. People grow old and die, but that's to be expected. Cats grow old and die, and that's to be expected. But not only did I not have any time to mentally prepare myself for this loss, but a big part of me was successfully ignoring the fact that people under 30 are just as mortal as those over 70. This experience hasn't caused me to confront my own mortality, or anything like that, but it has been jarring to have my expectations realigned like this. And like I said, I didn't have time to prepare for this. I wasn't ready for it, and I hadn't been able to process the reality of the loss ahead of time, so it's hitting me all at once. But instead of being able to sit down and confront it, I feel like I'm so overwhelmed that I'm still just kind of in shock about it. In the meantime, I'm just sort of going through the motions of what I think I'm supposed to do, and trying to feel what I think I'm supposed to feel about this.

I guess the one positive thing I can say about losing our niece is that the realization that I'll never see her again or make any new memories with her has really pointed out how many happy memories of her I do have. Sure, I also have the memories of the ways that she annoyed me and the stupid things she did that everyone always comes to cherish after losing a loved one, but I can confidently say that I have many memories of hanging out with her that are geuniunely happy and pleasant, and that in the short time that she was in my life, she brought me a disproportiately large amount of joy.

I know this was a long post--I tend to wax prolific when I discuss serious matters. Thanks for reading everything. Although I _am_ asking for your thoughts and advice regarding coping strategies, I also wrote this post with the intent that it would serve a cathartic function, helping me to work through my feelings with my rational mind, rather than having a jumble of emotions playing musical chairs in my head. I guess to some degree, it has, but I think now I need some time to process everything, before I can make sense of it all.

To wrap things up, I'll leave you with a quote from my niece's About Me section of her Facebook profile. I know it seems a little trite--and stereotypical for a 25-year-old girl--but it seems entirely appropriate, if a bit painful:
""Some important lessons about life: What you see is not always what you get. Love always wins. Be true to yourself. Don't take a single moment for granted."""
urxi9,0,2012-06-08,How in the world do I fix my current social an economic situation?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/urxi9/how_in_the_world_do_i_fix_my_current_social_an/,"Dear Reddit, 

I’m trying to figure out where I went wrong and concrete solutions to my perceived problems. 

********************************
Start TL/DR;
********************************

My current situation is as follows:

•	20 going on 21 years old

•	Zero living friends (will elaborate later in this post)

•	Dead end job that barely makes ends meet.

•	Occasionally do questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.
 
•	Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 

•	Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating. 

********************************
End TL/DR;
********************************


To be frank, I’m fucking distressed. To put things into perspective, I’ve been homeless as a minor and lost my mother when I was 7 and still never felt this bad before.  My view on the list above is as follows: 


Problem A) Zero living friends. 


Most of my friends were in Seattle, WA. The short version is that most of them overdosed on drugs of their choice or combinations of them. It still doesn’t change how I felt about them or still feel about them. They were all I had in the world that I knew I could depend on. These aren’t the friends that are only there on Facebook and whatnot, these were people that stuck their necks out for me. Since I started college I haven’t been able to make a single friend or contact. My existence is one of barely making enough money to continue, school  and having just enough sleep to avoid getting into a horrible car crash. 


Solution A) Find Friends.


Much easier said than done. I learned quite a few things about the character of people from living in austere conditions, but it turns out that most people are just as shallow as I remembered. The ones who aren’t still give me the same funny looks, so I eventually adopted an “I don’t give a fuck” policy and simply spoke what came to my mind. A prime example of this would be what we call “The Porch Kids”. There was a smoker’s porch at my old university and it had some interesting characters on it. I was homeless at the time (2nd time around, longer story involving a backstab and failed attempt to get me and my significant other to Florida). All of them cracked homeless jokes. Some even started rumors about me being homeless. I was asked if I was homeless. When I told them the truth, none offered to help. They bugged out, actually. Once I was on my feet again, I found that most of them have called for various favors, but out of 8 or so, only one has treated me decently, and I actually view him as a role model even though I haven’t heard from him in a month. Most people also don’t believe I’m 20 and that presents a barrier when trying to make friends and network. Either way, I used to approach situations neutrally, got treated like shit, decided to not follow social protocol, still get treated like shit so I opt for not following protocol because it is easier. 


Problem B) Dead End Job that barely makes ends meet.


I started at FedEx Ground where I used to live and moved up from a package handler to QA then to a management. The city I used to live in was so expensive even as a full time manager, I still got by on the skin of my teeth expense wise.  I had to bump down to a package handler again for the transfer to the city I’m in now. The positive is that I can barely get by on 15 hours of work a week due to the extremely low cost of living. The downside is that my work environment is terrible. It’s a lot worse than when I was a new hire in my old city. To get an idea, you have 6 guys including myself at this facility. I bust ass and am responsible for not just one door, but all 4 doors while we have one guy splitting (not as difficult as loading trailers but still hard) 3 guys unloaded vans and trailers (cake compared to loading one) and we have another guy that literally sits and does nothing. The QA does nothing either. The Manager is the same as QA. I find myself doing the shittiest and most difficult jobs in the shortest amount of time then doing the QA’s and manager’s job. To rub it in, when I’m pulling for the QA’s and manager’s slack; I then get told I need to increase my load rate. When I point out that one guy can only do so much (my average load a night is 3600-4000 packages, all industrial shippers greater than 75lbs a box) they tell me to only do my job. When I only do my job, then I get told to do QA and the Manager’s job. Tonight I went into their office to get a battery for a STAR III scanner and both of them were watching YouTube videos. I really hate my current work environment. It’s not the job, but the environment. 


Solution B) Find a Better Job. 


This is proving to be very difficult. I can’t find anyone that is actively hiring right now other than guys who are in the good old boys network. I’m still hitting the beat and will do my best to get out of there before December. 


Problem C) occasionally does questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.


I’m not going to go into what I do specifically other than I’m nothing more than a logistics guy. I don’t steal or sell anything. I have to do this sometimes to make sure I can pay tuition and other expenses if they get too far out of hand. I’m pretty sure I’ve lost part of myself or the ability to feel as much as I used to. I grew even more acute eyes in the back of my head and find myself checking the rear view mirror constantly, or if there’s a knock on my door, covering the peep while I stand off to the side. I also became even better in the woods and better at driving on a variety of surfaces ranging from tarmac to gravel. 


Solution C) Join the Army Reserve or Something.

 
I figure if I’m already damned good at evading trained personnel, have a little over half of a chemical engineering education, a wide variety of job experience ranging from customer service to welding, can move through the woods like a ghost, and get to elevated positions like roof tops that are inaccessible, I might as well make myself legitimate and serve my country. It would also get rid of my college money problems. I just can’t find a recruiter that doesn’t seem hell bent on fucking me over in any branch. 


Problem D) Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 


It’s just a depressing environment. I go on a 2 mile run every night after work and it is painful to look at my surroundings. I try to zone out and not think, but I loop back to what problems I’m trying to solve, and many times I leave home with fewer problems than what I come back with. It’s a fucking self-destructive cycle. 


Solution D) Finish My Engineering Degree and get the fuck out. 


This is the only solution that doesn’t present more problems. It’s actually the only constant I have right now. 


Problem E) Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating
Since day one, I have been fucked by financial aid. I have presented proof that I was homeless and independent as a minor in addition to paper work going farther back that I was in and out of state custody for a 6 year stint. It simply was an aide counselor not wanting to work with me and both institutions. I even wrote my senator about the issue and I got what appeared to be a generic response instructing me to fill out the FASFA. To rub it in, grad school and internships are a dead dream with my 2.2 GPA. People don’t understand that 8-10 hours a day working and full time school makes a C+ seem like an A+. With the fewer hours at work, I can focus more on school.


Solution E) 


See Problem C. It’s nothing near ideal and it creates the same fucking self-destructive loop. 
See Solution C. I just need to find a recruiter that’s willing to not fuck me over. Last one tried to tell me 88 mike was the same thing as forward observer. Airforce recruiter is so full of it his eyes are brown. 

The disturbing part is that I find myself wanting to die.  I’d rather have nothing than any of this. I mean what the hell am I loosing that is positive? I can’t even enjoy sex anymore the rare time I find a fuckbuddy. The feelings of distress and despair get worse when I start looking around myself. The average  20 year old college student appears to be happy. They have friends. They have a family. If they have to work they typically have high paying internships or a good part-time job that has little bullshit in it. They have great grades, and often don’t have to worry about making ends meet. It seems so alien to me. Almost like I’m an interloper and do not belong in what surrounds me. 


I’m looking for viable solutions that can help me achieve my goals- Not pitty. I’m going to be a Chemical Engineer one day. Please help me to do this. Anything. I’m tired of this and want it to be over

If I get a Sysadmin position it would most likely be a very junior position since I have no experience with things like AD other than a small project I did for school(set it up and add users). I'm not really seeing jobs out there that they would be willing to take me on and train me a bit.

uqpg5,1,2012-06-07,Should I take an unpaid internship if there aren't any other internships?,herdyderdy,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/uqpg5/should_i_take_an_unpaid_internship_if_there_arent/,"This place offered me an unpaid ~2-month internship which can eventually lead to a job at the end of the two months. Basically I'd be going around with the IT guy and learning all about networking/databases/hardware stuff. The thing is, I'm a senior in CS(1 year to go) and I've never not made money for my work. I didn't even realize there were unpaid internships, but it's the only place that has gotten back to me (didn't realize it was unpaid when I applied).

Is this a bad idea? It's kind of either I do the internship this summer, or take classes. I'd much rather do an internship but I'm just slightly put off because I'd never heard of unpaid tech internships before.

Any thoughts?"

Not even sure where to start...

We've been together a year and one month. He's 23 and I'm 21. He's from Europe and moved here to be with me. We just moved into our first place together..

Because he moved here from Europe he has lots of friends from all over. On of them though, has always not sat right with me. She's about my age and before he met me they talked all the time. He says they have always had a teasing/playful/joking relationship but had never had a sexual attraction or any kind of physical interaction except a hello/goodbye hug.

My first time being freaked out by this was a month into dating. I saw a facebook chat from here where they were joking and he randomly mentioned that his dick looked bigger when shaved. Didn't sit right with me. I got upset, cried, yelled. That's not an appropriate thing to say to another girl when you have a girlfriend.

In fact, when we first started dating we had the ""What constitutes cheating"" talk. We both agreed right off the bat that sexting/flirtatious messages was cheating.

Anyway this occurrence led me to ask him to please tell me when they were talking, not ask me if he could talk to her, just inform me.
Fast forward 9 months are so. We are living together in a temporary place. As far as I know he's always informed me of when they spoke. One day, at around 6:30pm he tells me again that they had been chatting for a few hours. Something led to me asking when they had started, he said idk, i said check the time stamp, and it said 10:30am. I dont understand why he would lie about something that trivial. Maybe it meant nothing. I'm just telling the whole story.

A while after we had a fight about me being controlling. I told him he no longer had to inform me of talking to her. He was on his own with that.

Fast forward again to last night. I went into his home office to get his tablet to play a game on. It was open on a fb chat from her. I didn't read it all, just saw something he said that looked flirty. I asked him about it, he said he was joking, and i dropped it. But it kept bugging me, so after he went to sleep I went and read the whole thing.

It started out normal, then got suggestive. She needs an internship and told him she was ""his"" if he could get it for her. He asked her things like what we he get out of it, she replied whatever, and he said sexual favors. It went on like that. There were plenty of this winky faces and ""haha's"" suggesting that the conversation had a joking tone. It reached its peak when she asked him what the favors would consisted of and he said: ""Generally you, me, a bed, or possibly some other random piece of furniture, maybe a third party if you are willing to agree to that.""

There was never anything more intense than that. Neither mentioned bodyparts or even referenced them, nobody said anything about getting hard or being wet, there was no descriptive text about licking, sucking, positions... nothing like that.

So I lost it on him. We talked for hours. He told me that he's been under a lot of stress worrying about money (I haven't been able to get a job since I graduated six months ago, so he is the only provider). He says that he has no friends here. He works at home and I'm always home, so we are literally together 24/7. I know that this can put tension on the relationship, everybody needs some alone time. He had never mentioned this to me before though. He said he always felt like that if he had wanted to go out along, drive around, go to a bar, play games alone, or whatever, that I would cry and react badly. He's right.

In the past I have overreacted about him leaving. I've found it hard to trust him because of the incidents prior to this one, and I know he could very easily cheat on me without getting caught. I'm worried that when I have a job he will be here alone all day, making it extremely easy to cheat. Anyway, the point is that I havn't been understanding about him needing his space.

He says he's felt pressured because of that. He says he doesn't know why he started talking to this girl this way. He was working while he was chatting, and says he wasn't even really paying attention. Whenever I ask why he did it his best answer is that he doesn't really know and that he thinks it may have been a subconscious lash out because of him feeling trapped in the relationship. I understand this, because I had a similar situation in my previous relationship.

Sorry this was so long.. I guess what I'm asking is what next? We have talked for hours and both want to work things out. I've told him that I forgive him, but i have not forgotten. I don't know if I can forget. The words just keep rolling around in my head. Probably worth mentioning, I told him it's me or her. He said me and I explained that that means he can't talk to her again, break off the friendship, no talking ever, no updates on life ten years from now. I said I want to see this message to her before he sends it and I want to be told if she ever tries to get in touch with him in the future. I feel bad about asking this of him, but at the same time I think I am within my rights to do so. He says he understand and would probably do the same if it was a reverse situation.

So what should I do now reddit? I'm having trouble letting go of this. I can't forget it. My trust for him is gone, and yet somehow I have to trust him to go out without me so that he won't feel trapped. Should I break up with him? Forget about it? Am I overreacting? Please Help...

**bold**TL;DR Caught boyfriend flirting by chat, forgave him but don't understand why he did it. Want to know what I should do now.

Edit: He just took the keys and went ""out"". Says he doesn't know where he is going or when he'll be back. This blows..."

I'm a computer science major, and just got my first internship at a small startup about a month ago.

The company consists of just 3 principles trying to launch their business.  Since being hired I've designed and configured their MailChimp, and am now building their site off previously established mockups, as their developer is no longer able to work on the project.

The principles are pretty computer illiterate and I am pretty much building the entire infrastructure of their web presence.  I recognize that they are at the very beginning stages of their business, and was told this in the interview, but...

I had hoped to be engaged in a learning environment, and I feel as though I am sort of being taken advantage of, and teaching instead of learning.

Is this standard for most internships? Should I look for something else or be grateful I am intimately involved in their business?

What doesn't make it easier is that it is a very exciting concept to work on, and the principles are extremely nice, cool people...

Any advice is greatly appreciated

**Edit:** Wanted to throw an edit in here to first thank the shit out of you guys for the advice and support it's been great.

Also wanted to defend my currently employers(?) to a certain extent.  They are nice, friendly, and smart people with impressive backgrounds.  But as noticed by the community, they are pretty disconnected from the actual process of implementation - even though they have mapped it.  

In thinking this over, I think it will be beneficial to both parties if I decline the web project in a manner where I explain the magnitude of the process in hopes that it gives them a better understanding of how necessary the employment of a professional developer is.

Really appreciate the advice, and opportunities that have resulted from this thread - you guys are great."

Thanks!

I loved to think spatially and always had a curiosity of how the world around me worked. Even while very young, my teachers would mention to my parents that I would rather study the bottom of a toy car than play with it. After being exposed to physics in high school, I developed my curiosities for why a horizontal wire would hang in a hyperbolic shape or how forces transmit through structures. I have also always had a strong desire to create and can recall many hours spent making 3 dimensional computer environments, building my first computer, and Friday nights at the bookstore fulfilling my curiosities of such things. Following a desire to learn more about spatial structures and systems, I decided to pursue my undergraduate degree in civil engineering and planned on obtaining a graduate degree in architecture afterwards. However, after exposure to flexure theory, Müller-Breslau principle, and the likes, I had become infatuated with the analysis of structures. I found the understanding of their complex interactions to be the most beautiful and fulfilling of any kind. Wanting a deeper understanding of their engineering applications, I have decided to pursue a master’s of Science in structural engineering at “said” university.

While studying at the “ugrad school” I became involved in structural health monitoring research as an undergraduate research assistant for “mentor”. Having an interest in the dynamics of structures, the opportunity for exposure to sensors and data analysis, and coming from a summer internship in the space guidance and navigation department of “electronics company” aerospace, led me to become heavily involved. As the only funded undergraduate on the research team, I worked closely with graduate students. At first my tasks were simple and involved writing reports on market searches for wireless sensors, embedded computers, work on cad drawings, and publication formatting. Then I became responsible for larger tasks and projects and had an opportunity to solve open-ended research-related problems. I worked closely with two graduate students on the possible implementations of using infrared and high definition video cameras for more objective bridge inspection methodologies. With the aid of the two graduate students, my responsibilities included the design of a candidate bridge prioritization algorithm, the organization of the research report, and the operations planning for a bridge site visit. I made a presentation to the “state” Department of Transportation on how such nondestructive evaluation technologies could be implemented into the current inspection methodologies. I discovered that I have an ability to organize and implement an idea. Realizing a need for more structural oriented industry knowledge and exposure, when the “state” Structural Engineers Association was looking to start a student chapter; I contacted them and sought out the feasibility of starting such a student chapter at my University. When I noticed that I could improve my grades through organization and technique, I meticulously developed smart study habits and corrected inefficiencies in how I held a pencil or my typing technique. The benefits of this came to fruition when I made a 4.0 during a semester of my senior year with 4 upper level engineering courses. 

I see the possibilities of integrating computer technology to stream line the design process and hope to have an opportunity to influence its advancement. My intentions are to continue developing my skills and deepen my understanding of structural engineering with a Master’s of science degree from the “grad school I’m applying to” and then go on to have a unique impact on the field of structural engineering.

This is a beast of a computer that I'm not sure I quite need (if you guys remember my old post about me hesitating to build one in the first place). However, I just landed an awesome summer internship so I thought I'd treat myself to something NICE. 

I mean I could probably swing 1400 but I don't want to pay that much for something I'd only use for school and *some* gaming (nothing too heavy either). I think ~1000 is more my price range. Where are places on this build that I could trim some fat?

Also, is it possible to make a Hackintosh *easily*? I despise Windows, and would like to dual boot Mac OSX with Windows. I might just end up running dual boot Windows/Linux if that isn't possible though.

Give me your stories and advice on choosing careers and changing careers as well!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwr3o/askreddit_how_does_one_decide_on_a_career_im/,"**My situation:** May 2011 I graduated with a degree in civil engineering from a decent state school. Even though I didn't really WANT to be a civil engineer, I picked my major because it seemed at least moderately interesting. For the ~18 months leading up to graduation I wasn't too enthusiastic about my major, but I figured I'd go with it.

Graduated with an internship, 3.7 GPA, and EIT designation (passed FE Exam junior year). I also worked throughout college to pay for my education (no help from parents or anyone). I have pretty good social skills and interviewing skills for an engineer: I was ""runner up"" in my first interview out of 20 candidates, and at my second interview was offered a job 15 minutes after leaving. 

Not trying to brag with that last paragraph (anonymously on Reddit with a throwaway, yeah right), just trying to say that I am a capable worker and I think I can do anything I set my mind to. The only thing is that my mind isn't set to anything.

13 months removed from school and I have had a temp job for 3 months and a job as a structural engineer for 9. I have no desire to succeed in my profession or get my PE license. I know I'm lucky to have a job, but should I be satisfied for the rest of my life with the thought of just having a job? I don't think so.

I'm only 23, but I'm getting a little panicky that I have no idea what to do from here on. Everyone says ""oh, you'll know what you want to do, don't rush it"" ... But what if it never comes? It seems like any path I might be even slightly curious in is a huge risk (see: money) for something that isn't even CLOSE to guaranteed? I know engineers often become teachers (summers off maybe, not much money) or bankers (big money, 100-hour weeks), but both of these would require me going back to school. $60,000+ more in education is so steep for just something so unsure.

**So, AskReddit, I would love your input.** I am looking for advice on my situation, or your own stories of how you chose your career and the risks you took to get there. Did you just ""know"" what you wanted to do? Are you happy with your choices? Do tell!"

I thought finding a job might be rather easy. Eighteen freaking months later, I finally got a job.

As most people graduating from college nowadays will tell you, you run into the ""You can't get a job without experience and you can't get experience without a job"" Catch-22 HARD and very quickly upon graduation and it can be annoying and discouraging.

This post is to try to encourage those out there who have yet to find a job (there is hope, I can tell you from experience!) and to ask for any pointers from those smarter than me on good habits to get into during this difficult phase of life. Some quick pointers from me that I picked up during my 18-month stint to start off:

1) As discouraging as it gets, *always* keep working to get a job as hard as you were when you started looking. It can get incredibly discouraging, especially when you start hearing the seemingly condescending ""So....why haven't you worked for a year?"" or ""So...what have you been doing for the last year?"" questions, but don't ever slow down.

2) Don't be embarrassed to collect unemployment if you're following pointer #1. Collecting unemployment can come with the negative stigma that you're being lazy on others' dollar, but don't let that stop you. If you're legitimately looking for work, that's what unemployment is there for.

3) Some people, maybe even your friends, may start talking to you like you're not doing your best. If they aren't giving you *constructive* criticism (ie if they aren't just talking to you with a ""You're being lazy"" tone), ignore them and keep working your hardest.

4) Stay busy. And I don't just mean ""play video games or watch movies all the time."" You won't be unemployed forever, use the enormous amount of free time that you have to do productive things now, while you can. Try starting a business if you have the money in savings (but of course, be wise!), try writing a book, or try using any of your talents/hobbies to make some money. If it doesn't end up making you any money in the long run, at least you were able to do something with your time that was productive. And, on top of that, you'll be able to (honestly) tell your interviewers that you've been doing something other than playing video games all day!"

I'm a 21 year old guy about to enter my last year of college. I'm going for a degree in my school's fairly new IT program with a minor in English. Anyway, since I didn't land an internship this summer I've just been thinking about what will happen when I try and find a job in IT. Anyway, I have some questions:

1. If you work in IT, what do you do? Do you like your job?

2. What kind of things should I be searching for when looking for an IT job?

3. My program kind of exposes you to everything but doesn't make you a master of anything. For example, I just took a class on Python last semester, but it was mostly just basic stuff. Next semester I will take a class on Java but it will also be basic, as well as a basic database tech stuff, etc. Anyway, when I look at job postings I see a lot of people want someone who is a glorified computer programmer so how important is it to be really good at something like Java to get a job in IT?

4. Anything I can do to spice up my resume this summer?

Thanks for any help reddit."
uwhxz,25,2012-06-11,"I'm a hiring manager at a well-known non-profit, with lots of strong opinions about applications and the job search. Ask me about it!",robertgfthomas,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uwhxz/im_a_hiring_manager_at_a_wellknown_nonprofit_with/,"I did an AMA a while ago, but I don't really want to answer questions about my penis size again. I'm happy, though, to answer any questions about the hiring process!

Please take my answers with a grain of salt, because every organization and business is different and looks for different things.

Off the bat, let me say that I see there being two main ways to market yourself to a potential employer: you can market your expertise in some particular skill or area of knowledge, OR you can market your individualism and personality.

You can try to market both personality AND expertise, but your résumé's only a page long and effectively making both of those come across in such a tight space is really, really difficult.

Instead, pick one, and commit to it like there's no tomorrow.

If you're applying to a job where you're going to be doing pretty mindless number-crunching all day, then the employer is going to want to see expertise over personality. If you have a BA in Accounting, really flesh out all the stuff you studied, and any practical experience you might have had. This isn't the place to say you were the star of your college's performance of 'Evita'. DO include a few things that paint an image of you as a human rather than a robot, but limit it to a line or two of ""hobbies/interests"" at the very bottom of your résumé.

On the other hand, it seems the vast majority of people on Reddit are 20-somethings who are fresh out of school. Odds are you've had a couple jobs here or there, took some relevant coursework, and were in a few clubs. (If you've already published a novel and you revolutionized Goldman Sachs' finance department while you were an intern there, then you probably don't need to be reading this because you already do what I'm talking about.)

Do NOT take the approach I see in 75% of the hundreds of applications I read every month and try to make your position as Publicity Chair of Alpha Beta Gamma or your summer job as stockboy in Walmart sound like something more than it was. 

You were NOT an Inventory Management Specialist; you were a stockboy. I was hired to this position in hiring because I sniff out bullshit like an Irish setter, just like every other hiring manager in the world. There is no shame in saying you were a stockboy. There IS shame in trying to disguise that fact, because it's basically lying to me.

So what the hell are you supposed to do?

My sister's an actress. Casting directors, like hiring managers, get those jobs because they're great at sniffing out bullshit. Most people when they go into an audition try to anticipate what the director wants. They think, ""OK, they're looking for someone funny, but not TOO funny, and someone whose voice sounds like this,"" and so on. Basically, they're trying to read the casting director's mind.

The problem here is that the casting director is human. This means a three things: 
First, they're looking at hundreds of auditionees that day most of whom are trying to be mind-readers and who are probably all going to assume more-or-less the same things — with the result that they'll all look exactly the same. 
Second, the director probably has a vague idea of what they're looking for, but they won't really know it until they see it. 
Third, the director really does NOT enjoy sitting through hundreds of auditions. They want the first person who walks across that stage to be IT. Second-best would be for every person auditioning to be at least be an easy ""yes"" or ""no"".

When you're auditioning — as with when you're applying to any job — don't assume you know who the director wants. You don't. Instead, think about who you already are. Think about a specific personality trait or style that is quintessentially You, and then just commit to that personality or style 100%.

Get a piece of paper or sit and stare at a wall and marinate in these two questions, until you get answers that are as specific as possible:

1) What are you doing when you're most ""in the zone""? What activity is the easiest for you to get lost in? ""Looking at cats on Reddit"" is a perfectly acceptable answer.

2) What are the things you're mildly ""obsessive compulsive"" about? For example, I HATE having unread e-mails and I HATE being around people who are giving each other the silent treatment, and I'm going to get really frustrated and anxious and worry about all that until I've done something about it.

Then, look for patterns in your answers. What you're going for are the behaviors that are most fundamentally and sustainably You.

Working for a non-profit, I see lots of people who ""just want to give back to the world."" That's very nice, but the reality is we're far more sustainably motivated by the things we DON'T like than by the things we DO like. You might really care about ending child poverty now, but your interests will probably change in the next year or two. However, if the concept of child poverty just drives you crazy to the point that you lie awake at night and worry about it and just want to solve it so you can get a good night's sleep — THAT would be appealing to me.

When you're writing your résumé, think about the things that you just don't have a choice but to do or to be because they're fundamentally who you are. They might not seem like strengths, but they're a tremendous asset in that those are most likely to be constant sources of energy. The things that drive you crazy now, or in which you can lose yourself now, will probably stay the same for a big part of the rest of your life.

As an employer, I want to see that. I don't want you to walk in wearing a banana costume — unless tense situations are one of the things that drive you crazy and you'll do anything to dispel them. If I'm looking for a technical editor, then sure, I might not hire you for the job — but I'll DEFINITELY, definitely remember you and feel much more of a connection to you, and since you showed me a clear picture of who you are — instead of a fuzzy picture of what you think I want — if I'm aware of something else that might match your style I'll be far more likely to refer you to it.

At any rate, I'm rambling.

TL;DR: You don't know how I think. So figure out how you think and commit to it 300%.

Ask away!"

I know everyone hopes to find one after graduation and that may not happen for most, but what would help someone in order to at least have a good chance?

What I'd like to do as a career in the long-term would be to work in the gaming industry within the fields of either Communications, Public Relations, Marketing or anything else related to those.I would like to get into the actual game companies or even just gaming magazines as well. I'd love it. Technology was another thing that had caught my interest as well - computers, phones, hardware etc.

I have gotten into writing for a gaming website and I have been doing that since March. I also did a little writing as a Digital Marketing Intern for another company. I'd like to further my experience and skills so that I get a good start. I was also trying to think of ways to gain experience in regards to skills in web or graphic design or even programming a bit, because I feel that maybe that'd help.

A friend of mine mentioned to hand-write letters saying that I am interested in getting into this field and ask what sorts of things do they look for in a potential employee and just go from there. It'd show that you are dedicated and interested from what he had said. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I am writing to you today to offer my services. You see, I am in a bit of a spot, as so many of us are. I graduated two years ago from my beloved OSU with a Major in English Literature and a Minor in Women's Studies.

Unfortunately, I was sick for the last few months of my degree and failed to consider an internship or my after school employment. I have since moved back home with my parents, and have been half-surviving on odd jobs unrelated to my schooling. And that is how I have found myself here.

I need to have experience in order to have my resume looked at by employers. I didn't get that experience in college, so I have been trying to find freelance work. A lot of that freelance work also requires experience. What is a girl to do?

I am looking to break into the editing and/or publishing world. I have the beginnings of a keen eye which will only grow sharper with... you guessed it... experience. I read constantly (I carry a book in my purse at all times), am working through writer's block and I do the odd editing/proofreading/brainstorming job for my friends.

I have a passion for learning and personal growth. My time as a substitute teacher has taught me that, while I may be good at it, I am not cut out to be an educator long term. Literacy is very important to me as well and I think that it is something that has sadly fallen out of style. I would love the opportunity to put my talents to work at a great company with similar interests. The opportunity to help women grow and prosper would be a big bonus for me, but who am I to be picky in these times?

And so I shall conclude this letter by saying that I will gladly accept any constructive help. Maybe you would like to help me through networking with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/connections?id=55823772). Maybe you have some sage advice, which I will consider even if I've heard it before. Maybe you are in the same boat as I am and would just like to talk and share some resources with me. And just maybe you are in HR at a company in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, and you would be willing to take some sort of chance with me by letting me get my foot in the door, even if it's just getting coffee and lunch for editors. I shall accept it all.

Help me Reddit: Forhire, you're my only hope!

Best,

uvssa,1,2012-06-11,In what unexpected way did you end up meeting and dating/marrying your SO despite the odds?,fbea,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvssa/in_what_unexpected_way_did_you_end_up_meeting_and/,"I'll go first. I met my girlfriend while working at a fashion internship with a start-up fashion site. She and I were both interns at the company. This was my first internship ever and wanted to impress so I would typically walk into the office dressed in skinny jeans, a tight dress shirt, dress shoes and the whole nine yards so that I'd ""fit in"" as a fashionable guy. My girlfriend didn't quite dress particularly in feminine clothing at the time, but rather chose to wear t-shirts and boy shirts (not fashionable at the time), which I understand the reasoning for now that I think about it. Our job was to interview people on the streets and hand out promotional material (essentially bitch work), and seeing as how our job required us to walk about 20 miles a day from one end of the city to the other looking for stylish people while baking under the sun. Gf was smart to wear comfortable clothing. I on the other hand was not as bright (pun intended).

More than half the other male interns were gay, so my girlfriend assumed that I was gay. I can't blame her considering that I was painting a mannequin's fingernails during a marketing project, which was part of an idea that I was responsible for having come up with. For some reason or another, I thought my girlfriend was lesbian. Two months of the three month-long internship passed and we didn't think much of each other. Apparently she didn't quite like me at the time and I shared the same sentiment. We may have butted heads a few times during projects. It ended up that in the final month, myself, and my girlfriend were the only ones left working on the mannequin project. The other interns had dropped out. Every day my girlfriend and I would walk around New York City with a mannequin in tote. We'd take pictures and coming up with story lines for a page that would go on the website. Eventually, we became friendly because we'd end up talking every day and we'd chat via text about work and non-work related stuff. During this month I began to develop feelings for her when I began to realize that she wasn't a lesbian after all. We'd take long walks around the city, and on several occasions she talked about the guys she dated in the past and was into. Funny enough, she (she's Asian) explicitly mentioned that she had only dated white guys, and here I was a socially awkward virgin Korean American guy who had never had a legitimate girlfriend (I've had teenage flings), trying to figure out if she liked me. All signs pointed to NOPE, but I was hopeful. I asked my friends, painted a picture to them of the situation where she was calling me ""dude,"" despite spending quite a significant amount of time with me, and every single one told me that she wasn't interested in me. I then in my final effort asked one last friend, who told me that my yet-to-be-gf seemed to be interested in me. Not sure why she came to that conclusion honestly, but it was good enough for me. 

The last day of the internship, my yet-to-be gf and I hung out till the wee hours. We decided to say our goodbyes, walked into the subway station, was about to swipe my Metro card, when I said fuck it. I was extremely nervous and socially awkward as fuck, but asked her if she wanted to grab drinks. I was one month into my 20th year of life at the time and toted around an obviously fake and blurry international ID card, but I thought to myself, hey, why not? I was naive and look like a 14 year old (I'm turning 24 and I still get carded for purchasing lottery tickets), and the thought that I'd get rejected with my ID never crossed my mind. I went to one place that a couple of older friends had told me about. I presented my ID to the bouncer at the door and he laughed at me. My girlfriend was two years older than me so she had no issues. I stood my ground telling them I was 21, which was obviously a lie, and the bouncer decided to call a manager down. The manager took my card, looked at me, looked at my fake ID, looked at my girlfriend, looked at me, looked at my girlfriend, and then handed the card back to me. He waved us in. In 99% of cases I'd never allow a minor into a bar myself, but I'm going to be a hypocrite and say that I'm forever grateful to that guy for letting me in. To my hypocritical defense I also did shell out a decent chunk of change that night. My yet-to-be-gf and I chatted about life, love and got drunk that night. We left the lounge buzzed, and while we're walking and my brain couldn't formulate rational thoughts, I thought to myself, FUCK IT (for the second time). I asked her if she wanted to be my gf. She said that's nice, but unlikely. She was going back to college in the East Coast and I'd be back to college in the Midwest. Of course I didn't think that part through. It was pretty awkward for about 2 minutes while walking silently next to each other. Then a third FUCK IT moment came to me thanks to alcohol (and no I don't condone underage drinking, but I'm going to have to be a hypocrite here). We ended up waiting for the light to turn green on a corner while cabs and people were whizzing by, and I mustered up the courage to take her in my arms and kiss her like I had watched in the chick flicks (I dipped her and everything). 

We kissed for a while, and eventually she invited me to her place, where I finally lost my v-card. I GFed her that night.

We decided to undertake a long distance relationship for almost 2.5 years, and after my graduation I lived with her for about 6 months. She actually recently moved overseas for a job, while I'm working in the states, so we're going through another long distance relationship, but I think we're managing. Of course it's not easy.

**T(fucking)LDR; Met gf at internship. Gf thought I was gay, and I thought she was lesbian. Worked on long project, got to know her better, I was socially awkward as fuck so I didn't know if she liked me. Decided to listen to the only friend who said my yet-to-be-gf liked me. Final day, despite my shitty fake ID, I was accepted into a lounge where I got drunk, got enough liquid courage to ask her out (twice kind of), and I lost my v-card. Now she has been my gf for nearly 4 years**

Any one else have any fun stories with meeting their SO despite the odds?"

My degree is in engineering but I am working as a technician atm. I have been doing very good work which I feel has been over looked for the past year. Because of my degree I am able to do the work of an engineer and the technician which makes me twice as productive at times. However I feel my boss does not see this. I have been working twice as hard as many of my coworkers so I was given a really tough project. In the year I have been making big strides on the project which has brought its completion to realization. I feel that my boss is not letting me leave my position now because of the work I did for this project. ( Because I am more valuable where I am than someplace else.) However because of that I am not given the opportunity to progress my career. So I missed out on this years intern program because my boss wants to keep me on this project. Now I have absolutely no chance to move from my position at this company because I missed out on the opportunity to become an intern and get an entry level position. What should I do to help my boss see that I should get an entry level job there. Or should I just look to leave?

I really want to lose weight and get more toned. During the school year, I did go to the gym and I did a lot of pushups, and my arms have gotten a lot bigger, but also there's a lot of fat on there too. Also my stomach has started to show, and I've never been able to see it before so it is very distressing to me.

And all they could offer me was a summer internship with the possibility of full-time employment in August if I can perform well (no guarantees). The internship is for 10 dollars an hour and the full time position is for 42,000 a year.

Both offers felt a bit underwhelming on the salary side but I can feed myself and still afford entertainment on it and that's all that really matters.

Is it worth it to take a hit in salary early on if you feel it'll be a true learning experience for you? Or is the experience I get likely going to be similar in all companies and I should just aim for the highest salary?"

It's a very crappy salary, and it's slightly depressing especially knowing a couple of friends are working in Apple and Goldman Sachs making over 90K straight out of school. I live in the NYC area as well, so I know for a fact that this salary is crap for where I live.

I've built custom frameworks using various libraries and basically learned more about web programming in 3-4 months than I have my whole college career. 

My development to maintenance ratio is probably 9:1 which is the best part. The environment is also very relaxed, and we joke around a lot. But there are also days where I have to stay late and get work done, although it's relatively rare. 

The job is great, the only problem is this awful salary. Should I stick it out and suck the company/developers around me for all of their knowledge and then switch? Or should I wait another month or two and try to ask for a raise? Any other tips would be appreciated as well (or similar situations/stories and how you guys have handled them)

PS I've been working here for about 5.5 months now. "
uxlxv,1,2012-06-12,"Help with out of state speeding ticket (live in IL, ticket in WI, first violation)",notspeedinginwsc,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/uxlxv/help_with_out_of_state_speeding_ticket_live_in_il/,"Hi-

I have a bunch of questions regarding a ticket I received for speeding on a freeway (11-15 mph). 

Details:

First off, my car (silver 2001 ford escort) and license have Illinois registration and I was driving East on 43 in Walworth County on Saturday afternoon at 3:40.  I was heading back to my college town from my internship site in northern WI to give a speech at an opening of an exhibition I curated at a museum, and had been driving for about 2 hours.   I was running a bit behind because of a housing emergency and water was leaking in and needed to wait for a plumber.My car does not have cruise control.  While I do not know how fast I was going when I got pulled over, the officer (a state patrol officer) showed me the laser radar at 87 in a 65.  I do not believe I was going that fast, but he was positioned halfway down a fairly steep hill.  He lowered the speed to 80 on my ticket, stating that he normally lowers the speed for people who cooperate.  I did tell him I was running late for an opening that I was headed to, but I did not admit to speeding (though I realize now this could be considered an implication of guilt). 

My fine is for $200.50 with an estimated 4 points on my record. This is my first ever violation on my record and I am 21 year old female and have had my license for 4 years.  I honestly can not afford $200 at this time as I am living off of grant money and I do not want this getting back to my insurance in IL as I can equally not afford an increase in my rates there, nor do I want to have to deal with my parents about it.  It will be difficult for me to attend my court date as I would need to request the day off and require me to drive 2 hours again, but there is a chance I could do so.

My questions are:

1. Should I contest the ticket in court or just pay the fine and be done with it?
2. If I contest the ticket, what should I plead in order to increase my chances of not paying/reducing the chance this will end up on my record?
3. I've heard of people writing to the judge, like this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i9r34/speeding_ticket_advice_needed/ . Is this a viable option in the state of Wisconsin? 
4. I've heard Wisconsin is one of the few states not required to tell other states of your driving record in state.  Is this true?
5. If #3 is true, do I have to worry about the insurance rates increasing?  I have Allstate if that helps.
6. Should I worry about mail being sent back to my parents house (residence as listed in IL)?"
ux7jg,1,2012-06-11,Grad School question.  Is it worth it?,klin324,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ux7jg/grad_school_question_is_it_worth_it/,"So I have read and heard from multiple sources that if you can't get into a top 10 or 20 (I hear different thresholds) compsci grad program then it is not worth going between the monetary cost of the program and the opportunity cost, especially considering how hot the job market is now for compsci grads.  I'm only talking about a master's program, I have no interest in working in academia so I'm not even considering a Ph.D.  I love computer science and I would thoroughly enjoy studying it (and conducting research) for two more years in an academic environment.  I recognize that getting a master's typically means a pay raise, and that is appealing to me.  I'm not looking for the typical response: ""If you're doing it for the pay raise you'll be miserable in a M.S. C.S. program"".  I'm just looking for someone to shed some light on the validity that there is some sort of threshold when it comes to going for a graduate degree.

Also, realistically, how many undergrads obtain research experience?  I know this is a primary factor during the admissions process, but I'm curious what the typical 'competition' looks like for the various levels of grad schools, top 5, top 20, top 50 etc...

Do internships hold any weight during the admissions process?

Thanks in advance for any insights."

I was a college junior at during that time and was seeking for an internship that would lead to full time.

I was rejected by almost all of them but eventually landed an internship at the end. This company will offer me full time employment upon satisfactory completion of my internship.

I've done a large range of interviews, from 10 minutes to 6 hours. I've been asked some weird questions and have received weird responses. My experience made me painfully familiar with the interview process and I know more or less how these things go.

What happened?",CookiesandCandy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v3fuy/redditors_what_are_your_unrealized_or_failed/,"When I was 10 my family took me to New York City and on a tour of 30 Rock. It was the best day of my life, and the day I decided I wanted to work in television. I spent my life working toward getting back to NBC. I bought my first camcorder at 12, worked in the newspaper in middle school, and took Video Journalism in high school. My senior project was a video yearbook. I moved to Washington, DC for college and majored in Media Studies in college, holding internships at CosmoGIRL! Magazine (lots of video and web content), CNN, a film festival, and a production company.

In 2009 everything started going south. I had another internship at Sesame Workshop I had to turn down because of graduation (no one's fault, just disappointed that another great love went unfulfilled), and an unofficial job offer at CNN was rescinded because of the bad economy causing a hiring freeze. No one else was hiring, either. I submitted my resume to the page program but never heard back.

Around the same time, I fell in love and when I didn't immediately get a job I moved back to North Carolina, since I could at least be happy with him while I looked for work. I applied everywhere - I didn't care where I went, he promised to go with me. About 10 months after graduation, after nothing but retail work, I was finally able to get a job at an amazing local news station. After about a year of working there I applied again to the page program. I was completely willing to leave my loved one to go to New York to follow my dream. He could follow me there - I was always more ambitious than him.

But the page program never happened, and I was unable to support myself on the minimum-wage rate I had at the television station. So I left, taking a salaried position in the sales department of a publisher.

It just hit me last night that I'll never be a page - I'm getting a bit old for it, and now I've spent about a year out of the TV business. I'll probably never live or work in New York like I had dreamed my whole life. I have a great life anyway, so I'm not terribly upset, but I'm definitely mourning the lost dream. I did everything right, but it can't work out for everyone.

She's definitely already disappointed and discouraged because she was not able to land an internship with a major studio, as a result of the senior portfolio reviews (or whatever you call them).  So now she's looking for basically any job, and the job market is already as shitty as it is, much less for someone with a degree in art/illustration.  She's gets more and more discouraged each day she does not get a desirable response to a job application.

Whenever I talk with her, it ends up going back to the topic of ""I paid $100K to go to this school, and I havent gotten any response from companies.  This school was a scam, they should have given us more help and informed us of companies that are hiring blahblahblah."" 

I personally find this to be a very self-entitled attitude, HOWEVER I do feel for her at the same time, and I remember what it was like when I was job-searching as well.  I remind her to keep searching, don't be discouraged, you will find the right place, don't take it personally, job searching sucks, etc.  But it doesn't seem like shes in a place to hear these things, and just wants to stay negative.  She's only been out of school for about a month, and has already been talking about how she may need to change careers, or go back to school for a second degree.

Any have any tips on how to help a friend not get so discouraged?"

I don't really know her that well, but weve spent quite a few nights together studying and coding up CS assignments, to the point that it became a pretty regular thing.  And over these study sessions, id begun to develop a crush on her.  We never hung out outside of that though.  We'd had tentative plans to go see a movie together, but those kinda fell through because of finals. 

During that week, I told her that I'd be going to Albuquerque for an internship, and she said that ""I should come visit you there!"".  I had thought she was joking at the time, but it turns out she was not.  I got a text from her the other day asking about hotels, and two days after that, she had bought her ticket.

I have trouble believing she has any kind of romantic feelings for me, mostly because this girl has seen me at my absolute worst. Unshaven, wearing dirty clothes, half asleep, etc.  But at the same time, there's a lot of evidence suggesting she does.  For example, she talks to her mom about me quite a bit.  She even told me her mom thinks I'm handsome.  And just yesterday she was lamenting the fact that I ""didn't give her a hug before I left"".

So how can I make sure we have a good time together?  I'd love for this to turn into something romantic, but I've never been too good at those sorts of things.  Any advice?

I am having so much trouble getting acclimated to this code base. It's orders of magnitude larger than any of my personal projects (Largest personal project was 10k lines, this is several 100k). Moreover I don't have access to actual product, so I can't toy around with it, nor is it really hostable on my local machine.

I don't feel like I'll be able to wrap my head around how this entire thing fits together before I'm done with the internship. Any advice as to how to start to piece the thing together in my head?"

You will be sharing a room with another girl, so females are strongly preferred (Sorry guys. That's how it goes). The side is unfurbished, so hopefully you have a bed or a desk. If not, our rooms are carpeted and we have a living room, so no worries there. 

We're located at La Scala, so its super close to the bus/shuttle stops to take you to school or anywhere. We've got a pool, a gym, and an office center where you can get access to free printing. Also within walking distance to Ralphs/Trader Joes, so food needs are easily met here. Move in date is on July 1, and you'd have to move out around Sept 8th. 

A little bit about us: one student (lit major) going to summer school at UCSD, one doing a computer-science-y internship, and another that works from home. We're all easygoing, relatively quiet, and pretty chill, so it'd be nice to have someone that fits this profile as well :) Also if you like board games, that's a plus! 

This is perfect for UCSD students who are looking for summer housing or anyone who needs temporary housing. And that want to avoid the BS of Craigslist. Feel free to message me if you're interested, we'll set up a meeting and what not. "
v2lk6,0,2012-06-14,Preparing for Internships,HerpMasterFlex,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/v2lk6/preparing_for_internships/,"Fairly common question I imagine, however I may not be using the correct search terms, my google-fu is lacking. 

Intro: High school student, going to an engineering college with few basic pre-req courses complete. Studying Computer Engineering, hoping for a minor in Economics. 

Question: It is common knowledge that freshmen internships are hard to come by, and things don't start getting ""interesting"" until Junior year, when the pre-requisite course work applicable to the position is completed. What I would like to know is what should I do to prepare for the various tasks ahead for internship application. Are there any specific materials I should be going over in preparation for the various interviews? Starting a collection of any projects I'm working on when I go to college for presentation. I realize this varies greatly from job to job, but I'm not sure where to start. Anything that I should specifically work on that will help me from the get go? Any adjunct material I should cover on top of my coursework that will give me a clear advantage or distinguish me from other candidates. 

What I know to do or have done: 
- Visit the career webpage of my university
- Prepare and revise a resume 
- Create a LinkedIn Account 
- Got to the career services office often, and meet with an occupation counselor 
- Go to career fairs held at the university
- Visit prospective company internship pages and understand the requirements for each position
- As with above: watch any supplemental material for preparation for internships
- Maintain a 3.0 GPA. 

Prospective companies I've thought about (of course this list will change, I'm just giving my naive and inexperienced look into a very competitive field which is engineering internships): 
- Freescale
- Marvell Corp
- Micron
- Texas Instruments
- Qualcomm
- Intel
- Nvidia
- AMD
These are highly competitive fields, I don't expect to land a position without proper preparation. Obviously, this isn't all the companies with internships for Computer Engineering. I don't have access to the internships board at my university (maybe I haven't looked correctly), so this is prior to actual ""investigation"" 


I'm rather ignorant in this regard and appreciate any help in this matter provided by fellow redditors. Thank you for your help. "
v55kn,5,2012-06-16,I left my home town and now I'm completely alone in a new one,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/v55kn/i_left_my_home_town_and_now_im_completely_alone/,"I just left my old city for a college internship out of town. I thought it would be a good idea to get some job experience in a different city. 

The problem is I want to be alone but I'm not. When I was looking for housing I signed up to live at a house with 4 other people. Its only been the first day and already I'm afraid to leave my room to go get breakfast. I wish I could see this place as a home but I feel like I'm trapped in my room and when I leave I'll be confronted by strangers.

The only two people I can say I would feel comfortable living with is my girlfriend and my old roommate/best friend back in my hometown. I need help. I have no where else to live but I want to avoid these people. But then on the other hand I don't want them to think I'm antisocial and never come out of my room. The feeling of not being at home in your home is killing me. I can feel all my old anxiety I thought I had under control rushing back and I just don't know how to deal with it.

EDIT: I finally made it downstairs for breakfast and one of the roommates was there. Made small talk. And I ate and came back up. I'm starting to consider keeping some food products in my room so I don't have to leave it so often."
v4y32,11,2012-06-16,Should I quit my internship?,KAMFlamenco,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/v4y32/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"Back in February, I was thrilled that, after numerous attempts of getting an internship, a utility company called me up for an internship and fast forward, I got the job.

At first, I was just happy enough that I will get some ""real"" life experience before I graduate (this upcoming December) so it will definitely boost up my resume (and it's nice to have a paycheck coming to your mail).

I applied as an part time electrical engineering in the GIS Dept. during spring semester. After few weeks later, however, it got really mundane and unchallenging (my work, I kid you not, consisted of drawing squares all day). I asked several times if I could do different task, but HR did not respond to my email until the very end of my termination. But I decided to stay with them because it was close to school, they were flexible with my schedule, and again, that small paycheck are what made stick with them for 14 weeks.

Now, after HR finally responded my email, she apologized and mentioned that there was a summer intern position (full-time) available and she sent me an email about it. It looked promising since it gave me a description of applying engineering skills (even though the pay rate was lower than my previous job, I value more on experience). So I applied and got the position.

Just after working in my new internship in my third week, I feel miserable. Here are the cons:

-My job ended up being as mundane and unchallenging as before. I basically just help organize files onto to computer. No engineering skills is really needed
-Prior to going there, my boss mentions that HR still wants me to the same task that I was doing during spring (why???)
-The facility is much further away from I school, so gas-wise, it's not helping (35 min drive vs 15 min drive)
-I am taking senior design this summer semester and I feel I should really spend more time on it than I am currently right now
-In addition, I should really spend time studying GRE (working full time really wears you out)
-Lower pay rate (significantly lower now that I've realized with tax included)
-no real engineering experience

The pros:

-Very laid back work environment
-I got my own office with a window (wooo!)
-A job is better than no job
-In the end, if I stick with them, I can possibly get a good letter of recommendation (I hope)

So what should I do reddit?

If I do end up quitting, I do not want to leave it in bad terms because I may use their resource when it comes down to reference and letter of recommendation in the future.

v4g51,1,2012-06-15,"I'm sick of the U.S. immigrant worker policy. H1B visas suck. I've been here for all of my adult life, yet have no real means to remain in America legitimately at this point. What the hell am I supposed to do?",throwitfarfarfaraway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v4g51/im_sick_of_the_us_immigrant_worker_policy_h1b/,"Hi Reddit. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this rant associated with me. Long post follows, and thanks to those who read. I'm trying to be objective - I'm really quite humble when it comes to describing myself (not in interviews of course), but I'm trying to be candid, and I assure you that my qualifications and recommendations are indeed true and well earned.

A little bit about myself: 

I was born to Indian parents in the UAE, and have an Indian passport. I've never lived in India, though, and spent the first 18 years of my life in Abu Dhabi (UAE's capital, often overlooked for Dubai). I came to the US to go to college, and earned my bachelor's as a dual degree in science and the fine arts from a school ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I then got a master's in graphic/digital design from a university whose graduate design program is also ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I've had great feedback from every professor I've studied under, both undergrad and grad. I've had good internship and freelance experiences and solid portfolio reviews from professionals and academics. My master's thesis was considered among the most well written and produced among those in the last five years of my program.

I've been looking for full time jobs in the US since I graduated in December, and I'm currently on [OPT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training), which allows me to work unrestricted for a year after graduation. This comes with the caveat that I can't be unemployed for more than 60 days, so I accepted an internship offer to work while I hunted for full time jobs that would sponsor my visa application. Since then, I've had offers for jobs that have been rescinded because of my sponsorship requirement, and also offers that I couldn't accept because the salary proposed was less than that required by the H1B visa petition process (the salary has to be higher than the [""prevailing wage""](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/wages.cfm) for the occupation and geographical area - yet one more hurdle for me, because I'm willing to work for peanuts to get my career going - just as any determined American would.) 

To add to this, the number of [H1B visas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) allowed per year is limited to a certain number (around 65,000). There's a specific start date to that application process (April 1), and the end date is whenever the cap is reached - which happened to be June 11 this year. So I'm out of fucking luck. My backup plans right now are: 1. Look for jobs with non-profits and Universities, which are exempt from the visa quota (want a funny story? I can't transfer this visa, if i get one, to a for-profit organization in the future, and will have to reapply under the quota if I want to make such a career change. HAHA.) 2. To move to the UAE or, if that doesn't pan out, India, and look for ways to come back in the future.

The funny thing is, I feel more American than anything else. I have no real attachment to living under a pseudo-benevolent monarchy in the UAE, and no attachment to living under a corrupt patriarchal government in India. The U.S. has its own problems when it comes to government, sure, but it's the only place I feel at home anymore. In addition, I've met the girl I want to marry here (but unfortunately can't, yet, due to family obligations and conservatism) and we're terribly in love, so this feels like a forced separation. I've considered the EU, but it's equally hard to get in there being an Indian citizen (and I'm quickly coming to despise this status).

Anyway, the primary issue here is that the visa quota for the year was filled this week, and I'm feeling very despondent. I'm incredibly frustrated with all the hoops that I have to go through to get a fucking job. I've tried incredibly hard, and seen candidates much less talented than myself (I'm trying to be objective here, I really am) get sponsored. I hate this situation, and I hate that I might have to leave the one place that I feel I can call my home, the friends who I think of as family, and the girl who I hope to one day have the financial stability to propose to. 

I know my options, but I hate them all. I guess I don't think I'm looking for advice, since I think I've covered every option I can think of - I'm not sure? I think I'm just looking for someone to read this, and understand what a shitty situation this is. Maybe I don't know what I want from Reddit. I dunno.

I'm frustrated at myself, angry at the U.S. and its policies, and just flat out depressed because I've been doing this for the past six months now. I wanted to get it all out, so thanks for reading -your time and comments are appreciated.

TLDR; H1B visa application processes suck. I've been here for 7 years, and feel like this is my home, but I'll likely have to leave anyway because of the U.S.'s draconic immigrant worker policy. I'm looking at non profits and higher-ed jobs that are exempt from the quota but things don't look hopeful. Shit sucks, man."
v7678,1,2012-06-17,"My older sister and I have nothing in common, she's controlling, a compulsive liar, and we don't have a relationship. Is it possible to have one at this point?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v7678/my_older_sister_and_i_have_nothing_in_common_shes/,"I'm 20 years old (male) and she's 24. When we were kids up until about when I was 9, we got along fine. She did the normal older sister stuff, bossing me around, we fought, but at the same time, we were able to have a relationship. Probably because we were kids... Once she got into middle school, she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. Drug users, people who drank alcohol, and just... weird. Not to mention a lot older than her. I'm sorry but it's weird if someone in high school is hanging out with a kid in middle school. Since then, she got into loads of trouble, got shit for grades, always lying to my parents about every little thing, and it put a huge strain on the family and my parents marriage (I think). My mother is more free-spirited, so my mother and sister have always gotten along for the most part, but my dad was the one who was trying to put some sort of order into her life. Like any normal parent, he set curfews and RULES. My sister has just never been someone who did what she was told. 

And then there was me. I can't remember the last time my parents needed to tell me that I had to do my homework, clean my room, etc. I just always did what I knew I was supposed to do, and never got into any trouble. I got along with both of my parents and never really had any issues with them. 

What the hell went wrong here? Fast forward to about two years ago. She was 22 and myself, 18. My mother went to Florida for a week to visit her mom, and my dad was always working at the time. I haven't had a curfew since I was 17, went to a friends house, and get a call from my sister, screaming that I needed to be home. It was 2:30am, but I was watching a fucking movie at a friends house. Forgive me... I get home when the movie ended because let's be honest, I'm 18 years old, and I'm not going to let my degenerate 22y/o sister try to enforce a rule that she just made up for me, and she just... yells. Telling me I need to be home when I was told, blah blah blah. She calls my dad, who's at work and doesn't have the time to deal with petty crap like that, and tells him that I shoved her, and just started spewing more lies out of her mouth. I ask calmly to talk to him, she pushes me, I grab the phone from her hand and she proceeds to grab my hair, kick my balls, scratch my face and hit my kidneys. At that point, I was pissed, but I knew that if I hit her back, she'd call the police on me and come up with some elaborate story to get me arrested somehow. I finally get her off of me, and I just leave. 

I'm convinced that I was more mature than her 22 year old self, when I was 12... I'm in my third year of college, just got an amazing internship, doing well and have good prospects for my future. My sister dropped out of community college that my parents paid for, and now works as a hairdresser who can't make enough money to move out of the house. At this point, whenever I see her, I'm just irritated. She doesn't even wash her own dishes. I can think of a million other things I don't like about her, but it'd be pointless. My parents also bought her a horse and 2 cars. All of which had to be sold/junked because she couldn't afford to maintain them and neither could my parents anymore. She's a parasite. Because of the financial strain she put on my parents, I had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans just to go to school. I know I'll be able to pay them off, but I can't help but think how much better off my family would be if she wasn't around. It sounds terrible, but I have no reason to get along with her as you can see. Recently she tried blaming our lack of a relationship on ME. This was after she called me, again screaming, telling me that I needed to get home and go with her to a wake that my mom said she had to go to, or she was going to ""kick my ass"". I just hung up, because obviously, that had the opposite effect that she expected. Now we're just not on speaking terms, as usual.

My question is, what can be done about this? After texting her and convincing her that she was indeed wrong to threaten me, she still thinks that until I'm ready to have a relationship with her, we won't have one. At this point, why the hell would I want to have one with her? She's just so different from me, and we obviously cannot get along because of her control and perhaps jealousy issues. I really don't know. People keep telling me that we should try to have a relationship, but at the same time, why should we have to force something like that? I just can't. I choose my friends wisely so that I can keep drama out of my life and have done so successfully. But, I couldn't choose my sister, and she is the only source of drama in my life right now. It's toxic. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I had to explain some specifics."
v6vuy,1,2012-06-17,"Reddit, I recently had a TERRIBLE experience with my orthodontist. What should I do? ",g3t0nmyl3v3l,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v6vuy/reddit_i_recently_had_a_terrible_experience_with/,"So, the other day I went to the orthodontist because i needed to get my teeth cleaned. When you get your teeth cleaned when you have to get the wires in your braces taken out.

My orthodontist usually has only interns. Fresh out of college. They never know what they're doing, they always hurt me, and sometimes it's as stupid as what happened the other day.

This intern lady had the simple task of putting my wire back in, but it was obviously too long. I thought she realized and would stop to cut it, but I started day dreaming and didn't say anything because I thought she would have it handled. So, she gets it in, and she needs to pull it out for god knows why. But It wasn't to cut the wire because she realized that later. Okay so she starts to pull and yank, and it hurts like a bitch. So she leaves me there for about 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing with half a wire in my mouth while she silently calls 2 other people over to help, so then I had 2 other people try and pull the wire out and no one said why it needed to come out. So they just end up saying fuck it and the actual orthodontist main person comes over and says ""oh, we'll just push it in if we can't take it out!"" and pushes that shit straight in to my gums.
Okay so now I'm bleeding, and he doesn't really notice, and then he calmly says ""oh, that's a bit too long. I'll cut that out for you."" okay so this wire cutter that he uses does in fact cut the wire. But once the wire got cut the excess wire just went deeper in my gums and they spend 2-3 minutes to try and get it out. Then he pushes the other side in my gums and that hurts like a bitch, but wasn't as bad.

Since they were pushing and pulling so much my mouth was sore for almost a week. (this happened about a week ago and my mouth is still kinda sore.) and come to find out, while they were pushing and pulling so much, it made one of the brackets (the big metal pieces on each tooth) come off my tooth. I know that it wasn't me because my mouth has been too sore to eat anything besides ice cream and really really soft stuff. The bracket is currently barely attached to my tooth, but I don't want to go back because of that experience.

I have had maybe one or two good - OK experiences in the 3 years I have gone to that place, but this has been by far the worst. My supposed to be 15 minute appointment went for 110 minutes.

But it's not like I can just stop going there because my parents already paid it all off. But that was just ridiculous and shouldn't be ignored.

[How can a recent college graduate get on a path leading to similar work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|There is no single recipe here. The thing that worked best for me is to be relentlessly driven by the desire to solve problems I really care about, and to be open to changing my mind along the way when I learn new things. A lot of successful entrepreneurs do this. They pick a vision of something that's important, and work as hard as they can to make it happen. It can be done inside companies. They all try to solve important problems. Act as if you already know that you won't fail. What would you do if you knew that you wouldn't fail? (credit to Regina Dugan for this question). And have a healthy disregard for rules. There are way too many rules, and they usually have only one effect: to slow down those how are active. If you believe your activities are in the best interest of the company that employs you - yet you fear you have broken enough rules that you might be fired - then you are doing well.
[What are the career prospects of someone who wants to do cool research and coding or robotics projects (as opposed to manufacturing automation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Now - on to education. We are trying to design Udacity around the idea of student empowerment. Rather than lecturing to you how to solve problems, we let you, the student, solve problems. I am a strong believer in learning by doing. I believe you can't lose weight by watching someone else exercise. It's really hard to learn by watching someone else solve problems (and lecture about it).
[How can self-learners organize their education so they don't have gaps in their knowledge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|I wouldn't really worry about ""gaps"" in the education. Even if your education is gap-less right now, it'll have tons of gaps 5 years from now. Worry about skills. Worry about that you feel empowered to solve hard problems.
[How do you aim to provide that guidance at Udacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Mentorship: There is a on of mentoring going on at Udacity, although I agree, we have a long way to go. This is one of the holy grails in online education. Can we educate at scale, yet still empower all students? Is 1:1 mentorship by an instructor really required, or can peers mentor each other with the appropriate guidance? We hope to explore this going forward.
[I'm sure you know the people involved with Coursera. What are the top differences that you see between Udacity and Coursera? What is your relationship like with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt3c?context=5)|I really want both entities to succeed. I really like Coursera a lot, and the founders are amazing individuals. Both companies are trying to being high quality education to everyone. We need more entities doing the same.
 |A lot has been written about the commonalities and differences between Udacity and Coursera. You cal easily Google people's opinions. At Udacity, we are trying to change the pedagogical approach. we don't just aspire to bring the existing classroom experience (lectures, assignments, exams) to the online world. You find that Udacity classes are focused around student exercise, not lectures. Videos are minimal, often less than 90 seconds long (although some are longer). At Udacity, you will spend more time thinking on your own than listening to a professor. I feel the online medium is so amazing, we should really go beyond the replication of the classroom experience.
[What keyboard layout do you use? based on the ""cal"" typo, it doesn't look to me like you use qwerty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ihjh?context=5)|Oops. Can. It's qwerty and I have no clue what happend. Perhaps UC Berkeley was on my mind (=Cal).
[1\) What would you say to people who want to learn to code?  2\) What programming languages would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|Of course.... I highly recommend CS101 at Udacity and the subsequent classes. All of them focus on making you learn coding by doing it yourself.  I recommend Java, Python, C sharp, Ruby, and perhaps C++ - depending on what you are using it for. C++ is great for systems level work. There are of course a lof of special platforms, like iOs, which requires Objective C. I don't recommend Fortran :) 
[3\) What programming languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|I should add: I know only a small number of programming languages. Some are archaic: Basic, Fortran, Lisp, Modulo II, Pascal. This dates me! Most of my professional programming has been with C++. I have also taught Java. Pythin is my most recent language, and I am not very good at it - as some people remarked for my CS373 class. But I am getting by :). I love python. I also love Matlab. It's amazing. I do a lot of prototyping in Matlab.
[At what point will there be too many classes on Udacity? Also, what is the one class you would like to see be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqsi?context=5)|I'd like to throw this back to the people on this forum. What classes do YOU want to see on Udacity? Please reply!
 |Wow - I love this thread. Thanks for the many suggestions - and keep them coming. You just wrote the roadmap for Udacity!
[Professor Thrun,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|Would love it. I hear form the Department Education that they are pouring $2B into the development of open source educational materials. They have an amazing vision. Anything ""open access"" is great.
[I am curious on your opinions on the development of high-quality open-access textbooks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|BTW, I wonder what happens to the idea of a text book in the video age. One of the things that frustrates me about books is that they ""don't talk back"". I can do the exercises, but the book won't tell me what I am doing wrong. I really want to see innovation on that end as well.
[Software is eating jobs, and self-driving cars are going to put a lot of people out of work who currently make a living driving vehicles.  Do you have any thoughts on how society should adapt to what seems to be a ""new normal"" of higher unemployment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hh5e?context=5)|Ever since time, and certainly through the Industrial Revolution, have seen a restructuring of the workforce. Over 90% of all people used to work in agriculture and now it's about 2% in this country (number may be inaccurate). Are we better off or worse off? I think better off.
 |This is just my personal opinion. I believe society is wasting huge resources with ""inefficiencies,"" and when we invent methods to overcome these inefficiencies, society tends to be better off.  I think we have to be socially responsible to the people who might be negatively affected by all this, but just retaining things as they are cannot be our guiding principle going forward.
 |Just my 2c.
[Do you believe that online schooling will eventually replace all classrooms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqo1?context=5)|No! Absolutely not. Cinema hasn't replaced stage play either. What online will do is to reach many more students, those who can't afford being in classrooms. And it'll augment classroom teaching to enable teachers to focus more on the tutoring aspects of learning, and meaningful small group interaction - over giving lectures.
[I have several people with Ph.D.'s tell me not to go on for one after my master's unless my career path genuinely requires one. Are doctoral candidates really that badly used and abused as a source of cheap academic labor with little hope of fulfilling the dreams they hoped they might achieve by earning a Ph.D.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt1a?context=5)|I would not share that opinion.
 |I recommend all my student to do a PhD if they would enjoy the process of getting a PhD. Getting a PhD is really all about learning to do research. Research is often frustrating, since you don't just find solutions, you also have to find interesting problems to work on. And someone who's great in college isn't necessary great in research.
 |A PhD is a significant time commitment. Make sure you'll enjoy the process, and you feel good about the process.
[Do you think something like Udacity will eventually lead to PhD level education, or is the general idea better suited for undergraduate work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hd52?context=5)|I don't think so, at lest any time soon. The PhD is a very personal experience where the interaction with the mentor is really essential. I don't think it easily scales to the Web. I think Udacity will go to Master's level for now.
[What is your favorite project you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glsm?context=5)|Self-driving cars, Google Glass, and of course Udacity. These are all very amazing projects to me. Plus - very importantly - helping my son to grow up (he's now 4 years old)
[What do you see as the major challenges for AI/Robotics now and in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h7e4?context=5)|I think we should really try again the big goal: create human level intelligence. I think this is totally doable. We now have faster computer than ever before, more data than even 1,000 humans can comprehend during their live times, and much better engineering. If I ever run out of things to do, that's what I'll do.
[Welcome, mr. Thrun. I'd like to thank you for your work on Udacity and being one of the people responsible for the current wave of online education that, I hope, is only just getting started. As someone who dropped out of university the ability to keep learning this way is wonderful, both personally and for my career. I'm also a mod over at /r/OnlineEducation, so please excuse me for promoting that subreddit here.  Udacity is planning on broadening their subjects into other sciences and humanities. You have also said that you think/hope Udacity and other online universities such as Coursera will largely replace offline higher education.  Coursera has Standford, Berkeley, the university of Michigan and others backing it. EdX is the work of Harvard and MIT. Udacity has no famous 'real-life' names supporting it. Do you think this will be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gy0m?context=5)|First, let me clarify. I don't think online education will replace higher offline education. Quite the contrary. I think it'll draw more people into education. Movies draw people into theater. Radio brings people to live concerts. It's long been known that MIT's Open Courseware program has drawn students to MIT.
 |I believe that online education will improve the educational experience and the outcomes. It'll give existing colleges and universities much more reach, and reduce their costs.
[Were you speaking English language in childhood? If not, was it difficult to you to learn English? How many natural languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glg6?context=5)|I learned Latin, English, and a little bit of French in high school. I pretty much forgot all my Latin and French. I learned English mostly by living in the US.
[Most courses in Udacity are at the beginner/introductory level. I also noticed that each course covers less material than its semester equivalent in a university. As university graduate, I would be interested in taking in-depth graduate courses in CS. Does Udacity plan to cover fully that need in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|This is a great suggestion. We hoped that CS212 and CS373 were graduate-level advanced. But I agree we need more advanced classes.
[How come you abandoned a successful career at Stanford? AFAIK you advise your team for a few hours a week? Do you plan to return in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on my decision to teach online at my DLD talk (google me and DLD video). I really am intrigued to help hundreds of thousands of students worldwide, and to empower them.
[Do you have different views/approaches on online education with your Stanford colleages (Ng, Koller\) @Coursera? Which are these?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on Coursera above - I am excited to see so much activity in this area. Together we can change the world!
[(transferred this question from previous thread\) **How do you complete a project (that's not part of a class\) where it's not clearly defined, and you don't know what you'll need to learn or what steps you need to do it?**  I can complete classes because they present material step by step and give you exactly what you need to solve the problems that they give you.  But when I want to do my own project, it's not clear what I have to learn to solve it.  Furthermore, I'll start learning a topic to solve it, then find that I'll have to learn something else.  It's not clear how far I'll have to search and how deep to finally get my answer.  Often it's frustrating. As a result, I often give up on completing the project.  So how do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51het5?context=5)|I agree, this is had. The best rule for project completion is to complete it. When you get frustrated, I bet you get frustrated because things don't proceed as you want them to proceed. That's a learning opportunity right there. If you give up, you miss out on the most important part: the opportunity to learn something surprising. If you understand this, and use this as a learning opportunity, and develop pride once a hurdle has been taken - you will complete your projects!
[(I'm copying 2 relevant items from the previous thread, here is #2\) As systems become more autonomous and intelligent, what kind or research do you think needs to be done to make sure the machines ""understand our wishes"" properly? Specifically what do you think about SIAI's efforts in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gmrf?context=5)|I think this is key to intelligent systems. In the end we build smart systems to help us, the people. Not to serve themselves. A lot of existing technology doesn't really connect to people. But.... the machine doesn't have to be human like. My calculator perfectly understands my wishes (by pushing calculator buttons) without smiling at me and asking me how I feel.
[**1. As a child/teengaer, did you always thought you were going to grow up as a person of major influence? Did you always knew you were smart and perhaps always one step ahead of your peers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|I was just the opposite. I didn't think I had a talent. I honestly didn't care much about school, and it took me until college to realize I am actually good in math.
[When did you start getting into computers/coding?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|Two things I always had were: passion, and a gentle disrespect for rules. If people say it can't be done, then likely those people are wrong. But instead of arguing things, I really tried to do things, and to keep my mind open for learning new things.
[Also, could you please do a C++ class for udacity? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|So be passionate, try things, and when you get stuck don't give up. See it as an opportunity to learn something new. Every wall can be climbed, any ocean can be crossed.  
[You mentioned at one point that designing good questions is key. Do you use trial and error for designing questions or something more systematic? Have you thought about hiring an instructional designer to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51grfo?context=5)|We don't do a great job with this quite yet. In my own class, I usually do things twice. The first version of questions is okay, but will be rejected by our internal instructors. The second version is then much better. We still don't do a great job with A-vs-B testing, and we don't yet have a good mechanism for student feedback.  So much more work to do....
[1\) How long would you estimate we have, before we are all riding around in self-driving cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|Highly recommend a visit to Google. The company is truly amazing.
[2\) Is Google's campus really as awesome as I've heard it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|As for time: I wish I had a crystal ball. We are still focusing on getting the technology right.
[1\) What is the reason that Udacity's coursers are easier than Coursera's coursers and graduate level courses in general? Is it deliberate approach? 2\) Are you planning to implement sort of holistic approach when students may get equivalent of knowledge that brick and mortar universities give? Or you are going to provide just special courses for someone who needs just to broaden his knowledge? 3\) It seems that Coursera provides coursers under brands of universities (Princeton, Stanford, etc\) and Udacity provides coursers under name of its authors. Why is it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hacg?context=5)|Some people thought the Udacity CS101 was harder than the Coursera CS101. I haven't paid much attention to the other courses on Coursera's Web site, sorry.
 |We are trying to make complicated material as accessible as possible. And we are trying to shift the focus from lectures to exercises. I generally believe exercises make material easier to learn.
[Ai-class was highly connected to Stanford University. Why did you decide to make Udacity completely independent of any university?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|I love edX and what MIT and Harvard is trying to do. The more of us try to do meaningful online education, the better.
[What do you think about edX (MITx + Harvard\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|Udacity is independent because we want to radically innovate. I think as a Stanford entity, it would be hard to issue meaningful certificates without confusing the entire world what these certificates mean. And remember, in AI Class we graduated 23,000 students with a certificate (and we never checked IDs).
[Thanks for Udacity! It's a great place!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|We have an excellent relationship with Stanford. President Hennessy and I meet regularly. 
[Will google glass ever be... real?  Please! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ijhr?context=5)|Babak Parviz and the team are working on it!
[For Google Glass, are you currently beta testing the devices with people out in the world?  And if so, is there any way I could get my hands on a pair?  Also, you're pretty awesome both for your neat Google stuff, and for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h845?context=5)|Thanks!! Glass: A few of us at Google are testing them in public right now, and it seems there is now a good number of photographs of people who spotted us.  But we are not handing them out to others right now.
[What do you think of the future of Symbolic AI?  In what areas would Statistical AI not be suitable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hcl3?context=5)|I feel the pendulum swings into one direction, then into another. If you look at the best of AI in a company like Google, there is a lot of symbolic AI. But it's different from the symbolic AI from the 1980s. It's using extensive machine learning, and it marries symbols with probabilistic methods. I believe symbols will be in, but in a very different way from how it all started.
[Professor, I took the first CS101 course on Udacity and I have to say it was amazing. What else are you doing to encourage technology and the sciences? I've always felt that Google should have some massive expo for kids like the Stark Expo in Iron Man 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h17h?context=5)|For high school students: I very strongly endorse US First. Dean Kamen and the First team are doming something amazing for the Nation. If you haven't heard about this, Google it. A great way to spend your time!
[I think Udacity is a brilliant idea, and I'm really excited to see where it will go in the future. I was wondering, are there any plans to expand into subjects outside of computer science and mathematics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gywb?context=5)|We have decided to stay within technical fields for now, especially in areas where there are ample employment opportunities. We are getting a ton of interests from employers, and many students asking about meaningful certificates that employers would accept. Once we have figured out how to make it work in CS-related fields, we will think about extending this to other disciplnes.
 |So let me turn this around: People on Reddit: what subject disciplines would you like us to cover???
[Is there a future for Udacity to give degrees or will it always be just a learning service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51imx8?context=5)|We are moving into certification. We soon will be offering in-person tests through Person VUE. We are working with employers to give meaning to these certificates. We already placed students in jobs.
 |We won't give a ""degree"" any time soon, and we are not accredited.
[Are there any plans for networking courses?  I'd really enjoy a good class on that, especially as the world becomes even more connected.  Thanks for doing what you're doing!  Keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51indm?context=5)|Thanks - will add this to our list. I agree this would be great to have!
[One Question: I'm fresh to the tech industry, coming from and currently on the business side of a start-up. One inefficiency I notice all over SOMA is that businesses are so silo-ed between those that can code, and those that cannot. Certainly the best productive value is had when someone is proficient in both domains, but it's a difficult and rare medium to achieve. As you built a team of researchers, how did you evaluate the proportion of the team which would be focused on each? Do you favor the silo-ing methods, or do specifically search for people with both sets of knowledge? Or instead is having business-focused people superfluous at the beginning of a tech-project?  Second Question: This is the age, once again, of the amateur scientist, so they say. I believe it. Do you believe that great innovation in the next 10 years will come out of garages, or instead do you believe that it will take the foresight, risk taking, and bank accounts of a company like Google to to underwrite impactful research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51olqs?context=5)|I much prefer people who can do things. Talking is one thing, doing another. We have way too many people who talk, and way to few who do. In Web start-ups, programming is a big part of doing. But there are many other ways. Get things done, don't talk about how to get things done. This is my mantra.  I think great innovation will first and foremost come from great people. People with vision, skill, and determination. (and we only teach skill at Udacity). Innovation can take place at large companies or small companies - even in Government. But often bureaucracy kills innovation.  
[Could you be awesome and do Physical Chemistry? There appears to be little to no online lectures for this tough subject.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c521o9s?context=5)|Noted! :)
[To second this, Udacity's focus on mix of making you write your own code and interpret existing code really solidify the new content they've introduced.  Also, they introduce concepts in a way that really allows you to understand the building blocks leading into more complex constructs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ir33?context=5)|Thanks! Cudos to Dave Evans. He's amazing.
[I second this. My company is committed to employee growth and we spend real resources on it. Something that was designed for internal skills training would be sweet. Our CTO currently teaches interns and qa how to code in weekly classes. That's expensive time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51i8ro?context=5)|Yes, we are interested. Although I am committed to open education. We can't lock up education in silos.

v5sv4,3,2012-06-16,Question regarding internships,french_toast_morning,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v5sv4/question_regarding_internships/,"Hi all, I will be starting my third year at university this fall, and I'm studying computer science. I have an internship this summer doing IT work that doesn't involve coding/development in any way, it's more of a managerial/project management program. 

I've decided that this line of work really isn't for me, and that I want to go into software engineering/development. Is it going to be a difficult transition for me? I feel like as long as I continue to develop my technical skills through coursework and side projects I should be fine, and that exploration of multiple possible career paths is one of the purposes of having an internship. Still, a part of me feels like having this on my resume is going to work against me, and push me into roles similar to what I am doing in this internship in my future.


Any advice anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

Today I went into work knowing I'd only left myself a handful of tickets. I figured it would be a (relatively) relaxed day. And it was, for a little bit. *Cue ominous music...*

Around 11:00 my boss busts into my office in pretty much full panic mode. Apparently there are two new interns he wasn't told about, that I need to set up with accounts and a machine (a full day of work at top speed). This would be fairly standard, had we been informed two days earlier. But we hadn't, so there were two interns sitting downstairs at their desks, twiddling their thumbs and looking bored all day, because they needed computers to do their jobs.

*facedesk*

TL;DR: Someone in management is probably trying to get the sysadmins fired"
v8rgx,3,2012-06-18,Making the transition from internships to actual jobs/job offers.. How do I do it?,sambunny,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/v8rgx/making_the_transition_from_internships_to_actual/,"I have an AA in journalism and intend to continue my education at some point.. That being said, I feel as though I have enough experience and enough skill to start applying for jobs in my field.

I have tons of experience working for my college publications but I've also had an ""internship"" with a local newspaper. I was really a paid reporter for the news and features desk, writing more than 30 stories in the few months I was there.. I was not offered a full time position because of layoffs and budget cuts and freelance wasn't worth it.

I then had an internship with a major television corporation. I worked with a division of NBC Universal and wrote several articles and worked very closely with many of their main columnists/editors.

Is this enough experience for me to start asking for actual career positions? Or am I going to be stuck in the land of internships forever?

I know I could get another internship, but I'm ready to be paid for my work and I know that my portfolio is strong enough to prove I can do it.

So, do I send out my resumes and cover letters asking for paid positions? I'm not really sure what to do at this point. Do I still search for internships and try to find companies that will offer positions if I prove myself? Help r/jobs!"

:--|:--
[Parents..........go! how do they act? any instance of special asshattery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wri8?context=5)|Parents, I've been waiting for this. Anytime someone asks me if my job makes me hate kids me response is ""It makes me hate the adults raising the kids alot more"" so experiences with parents usually goes one of the following ways.
 |If the kids been hospitalized before, the parents are usually pretty chill, they know the routine etc.
 |We then have the parents who refuse to leave their child with us. Basically in MA if a section 12 is filed on you, you must be hospitalized for up to 72 hours for obsevation. Alot of the times parents will refuse to leave the hospital or will try to take their kid with them. This is when we have to call the cops to deal with the parents.
 |I have two instances of special asshattery.
 |We have ""passes"" on the weekends where a child and their parents can visit off the unit as long as they stay on hospital grounds. Mom took the kid on pass then just drove the kid home. AFter we called the cops and got the kid back, she filed abuse charges against everyone on out unit...all unfounded but still a pain to deal with.
 |We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff, fighting at school, making suicidal statements, drinking a bit. She comes and her mom is a bitch to her the entire time, swearing at her, telling her she hopes we keep her for months etc. Cut to two weeks later, the girls discharged to her mom (we informed DCF about suspected abuse, they didnt see an issue) Girls back three weeks later because her mom tried to kill her and her little sister. My patient actually caught her mom choking her sister and fought her off. But yeah, if I ever see that mom again I will kick the shit out of her. No questions about it.
[*We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff...drinking a bit.*  I did a double-take.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yi0s?context=5)|When I first started I thought it was silly they didn't have a kid's admission packet that omitted that substance use questions, after the first week I realized just how many kids were using drugs/alcohol.
[It's kind of sad that an 11 year old drinking a bit and making suicide attempts is ""pretty routine""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yeyr?context=5)|Just a clarification she was making suicidal statements, she didn't have any attempts.
[Most fucked up / scary story to tell ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w0o0?context=5)|There are way too many. One that comes to my mind right now involved this 5 year old boy we had, he was severely sexually and physically abused and thus had a history of sexually acting out. One day I was sitting outside his room playing with him.  Out of no where starts telling me to suck his dick. I try to talk him down, he then pulls his pants down, and proceeds to grab my hair and tries to pull me head down to his penis, i was able to get him off of me but still having a kid that young, already acting that violently and sexual to this day fucks with me a bit.
[Are you make or female? I mean, as much as the whole situation is fucked up, the degree of how fucked up it is changes depending on your gender. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y2as?context=5)|I'm female.
[Are there ever kids or adolescents coming in who you consider so dangerous, like psychopaths, harming others and fully aware of what they're doing? and would you think it's better to keep them locked up for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wlg1?context=5)|One kid (a 9yo boy) in particular comes to mind. He's been in twice, once for killing his neighbors dog and once for trying to murder his baby brother. He came at me with a toobrush he had snapped in half once He was such a good liar, and manipulative and could be so charming. You can't diagnose a sociopath that young, but none of us who worked with him will be surprised if he's the next Ted Bundy.
 |But in spite of that, as far as children go, I am completely against forced institutionalization 
[Wow i'm in shock, i was actually expecting to hear: no that only happens in movies or something. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wqlq?context=5)|I guess I should add that it is pretty rare. Even my coworkers who have been in the field 30+ years said he was one of the worst kids we had...so it happens but rarely.
[Sometimes clinicians (that I've known\) have diagnosed child antisocial PD under PDNOS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xbx0?context=5)|Yeah most I've worked with prefer not to just because technically according the DSM you can't be diagnosed antisocial until your 18, even if its under PDNOS. Most I know will label it as conduct disorder (which is pretty much just a child version of anti-social PD)
[What's PDNOS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y4nd?context=5)|Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
[I'd always heard ""PDDNOS"" - Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified, but it's nothing like what you are describing - at least not what I've learned of. Do you know if they are just to very similarly-named, different disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yjcb?context=5)|Yeah, PD is any type of personality disorder. ANd most psych disorders have a NOS category, for example Anxiety NOS, EDNOS (eating disorder NOS etc)
[Oh my goodness, we need to have an actual popular holiday in appreciation of people like you and other staff working in jobs like you! Do you have anymore stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xuyn?context=5)|This is probablly the only time I've been full on left speechless by a kid running their mouth. This 7 yo girl (who was one of the cutest things ever) and this boy are having a fight. I seperate them but they're still yelling down the hall to each other. SHe tells him to go suck his dad's dick. He says that his Dad is dead. She replies ""Good then go dig up his fucking bodies and suck the maggots out of his dick then""  There was defiently a good 20 second silence while me, the coworkers, and other kids tried to take that comment in.

[Do you not get drug tested when working with kids? Also I think everyone has read way too much into the fact you have few beers and a blunt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5240wf?context=5)|We got drug tested upon hire, and once a year but thats it.

I had gone over to the adult unit just to provide an extra body becuase they were having a pretty hectic night and all the kids were sleeping. I'm just chilling over there when all of a sudden this women sees me and goes ""Fuck you bitch! You think you can fuck my husband and steal my crocodile""then proceeded to try to punch me. Good times.
[Why did you steal her crocodile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ydaj?context=5)|A crocodile's a dangerous item. I can't have that shit roaming my units.

Do you see yourself continuing to do this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xkf3?context=5)|I personally like working with the kids more, but the adult unit is also really interesting. I'm starting grad school in the fall to get my master's in counseling so I see myself staying at this particular job until I have my masters.

[What is the youngest child you have had admitted?  Roughly what percentage of children you see do you think will be able to be independently functioning adults?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51vnlz?context=5)|The youngest age we will admit is age 4, and we have had a good amount of them while I've been working there.
 |The functional adult question is a little bit tougher. Ideally, I hope with intervening this young, most will be able to function as an independent adult. Realistically, I'd say probablly about 50-75% will be able to do so. Most of the cases where I think they'll have problems as adults, are the severely abused and the ones getting bounced around in DCF custody. The system sucks, so I have less realistic hope for those kids.
[What was the four year old admitted for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51z70d?context=5)|We have had a few since I've been there. One told his pregant mom he was gonna kill the baby then stabbed mom in the belly with a fork. Another recent was a 4 year old girl who lit her mom's bed on fire (while her mom was sleeping in it) because she ""wanted mommy to go to hell so she made it hell""
[Was the child abused? Or does this just happen for no reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5202go?context=5)|Yeah there was abuse in both cases, most of our kids have some type of trauma history.
[Do the kids have to wake up by a certain time?  Can a kid stay up later than 8 or 9?  Male to female ratio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|Kids can stay up later than 8-9 but they have to be doing something quietly in their room after that time  Male to female depends. We can have up to 14 kids, and the ratio varies all the time.
[If one of them is schizophrenia, how are you told to deal with it? Are you told to act like some of the hallucinations are real if the child is young and doesn't know any better?  How many patients are there per room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|We don't have too many kids with visual hallucinations but when we do how we handle does depend on the age and if they are able to grasp the concept of a hallucination. Its not ideal, but sometimes we will pretend they're real if its the only option. For ex, this one 4 yo would always complain of seeing snakes. If we ""killed"" the snake he would calm down.
[Most fucked up example of parenting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|All the rooms either have 2 patients or 1 patient.

[On the other hand, do you feel that sometimes the institution you are working for is bad for a particular child recovery and may be pushing him down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c523kqi?context=5)|It can happen sometimes. A big thing that happens is alot of the times certain kids will bully another kid. Us as staff do our best to keep them seprated or are civil to eachother but kids do tend to bully eachother which is obviously not the best for their recovery.
[I don't know if you have experience with this, but what happens when the child's family disagree with the doctors about treatment, i.e. refuse to treat with medications? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ww3y?context=5)|Well we cannot give meds without the parents consent to each specific med so in that case they just do all the therapy and stuff without medicine. 
[Are social services more likely to be notified about a family if the parents do not consent to medicines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ygv6?context=5)|Nope that's entirely in their right.
[Have there ever been guardianship issues when the parents are being ""holier than thou"" and the therapy alone isn't working?  Just curious.  Not saying a pill cures all (it doesn't, working in pharmacy I get sick of this question\).

But since we are designed as a short term unit, unfortunately what happens in this case is the patient is discharged even if they aren't better.

[So, job interview! I ask you why you decided to pursue a career in this field. Do you give me that true story or go with the safe bet and make up some nice BS? Personally I think I'd go with the true story (it sounds very poetic\) but replace the ETOH / drug use with something less severe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c52fxt1?context=5)|I used a toned down version that didnt involve the inpatient stay but mentioned that i stuggled with depression and anxiety when i was youner

I do believe that starting talk therapy and learning coping skills at a younger age is beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, alot of these kids are of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics etc, which I think in the long run is worse for the kids because their tolerance level is similar to an adult, so the meds lose their effectiveness.
[I feel the same way about the talk therapy vs. drugs. Diagnosing mental abnormalities in children and prescribing psychotropic drugs to 'correct' them is a very slippery slope.  How long do patients stay in the childrens wing for? Have you bonded with any kids in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w3rh?context=5)|Most kids stay about 5-14 days or so. Though if a child is still having problems they will stay for longer. We have had kids there for 3 or 4 months before.
[My question: daily seeing all these kids that are messed up, do you think you would ever want one of your own? Do you already have one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zmwt?context=5)|I don't have kids, and working here does make me slightly terrified to have on haha but yeah I do still want kids eventually. Also, its made me consider adopting kids  more seeing all the foster kids we have. I'm considering adopting a few older kids just because it sucks seeing these kids who have been in the system for years and are probablly not ever going to be adopted because of their ages and histories.
[ off, thank you so much! It takes a strong and special person to do what you do.  Sorry if this sounds really nihilistic, but are there any patients that you don't think will ever be able to function in society? Any hopeless cases? If so, what is their future like? Institutions? Group homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ylie?context=5)|Not so much on the children's unit, but on the adult units there are weekly trials to determine if patients should be institutionalized at a state hospital.
[Are these children coming from abusive home lives? Trauma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zd05?context=5)|Yeah about 80% of these kids have some type of confirmed abuse or trauma history. And of the remaining 20% there are definetly some kids who have abuse/trauma but are not disclosing it.
[Yea sorry! Like what is the difference between this and a normal hospital. Are there group therapy sessions, or that sort of regular event? Is it kind of like a prison in a way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xdv9?context=5)|Yeah there are group therapy sessions run a few times a day. We are strictly a psych hospital, so we don't have the same equipment/set up as a regular hospital. And as much as I hate to say it, there are some similarities between it and prison. Locked doors, strict routine, unbreakable windows etc.
[Have you had any patients you especially bonded with? was it hard to say goodbye?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zw2v?context=5)|Yeah, actually oddly enough that 5yo who tried to force me to give him a blowjob. He ended up being there for three months, and he needed alot of 1:1 time just because he was so volatile with other patients, we bonded. And it was def hard to say goodbye, esp because his abusive parents were giving custody of him again and he was being discharged home. Hands down the most upsetting thing that ever happened 
[How did you get this job? Do they accept volunteers on the floor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xd5j?context=5)|We don't have any volunteers, everyone is salaried. My position is entry-level in the psych field so some hospitals only will require a high school diploma while others require an associates or bachelors. Personally, I have a BA in psych.
[Is parenting getting better or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xq77?context=5)|The head child psychiatrist once told me the following and I think it answers the question. ""The one constant in this field is that some parents will suck and others won't"" I personally  dont think is a generational thing thats improving or devolving.
[Has your hospital received any donations from Child's Play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xvmv?context=5)|No we haven't unfortunately. The latest video game system he have on the unit are gameboy colors.

[I am a student in psych (studying personality and psychopathology\), and I have a sister that works a similar job to you (though much less stressful and intense\). I am primarily research-focused, but am working on an internship in a MFT clinic. What in your opinion is the best method to bridge the gap between research and practice? I sometimes feel like I'm doing nothing useful for the children you see when I'm sitting in the lab doing lit review after lit review. Even the terminology is euphemized in the literature, so far removed from its' actual human presentation. It takes a lot to force yourself to think about what ""negative urgency, etc."" actually means. What are your opinions regarding this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xeur?context=5)|I definetly think research plays is just as important as clinical work. Most of the time I'm using all the concepts I've learned in my classes without consciously realizing them. For example, when a kid has a good day and I decide to give them an extra 10 minutes to stay up before bed even, or make them go to bed early if they had a bad day I dont think to myself ""Why, thats some nice operant conditioning."" when really thats all it is

I guess it would depend on the severity of the issues, the kids age etc.
[ off, thank you for what you do.  Do you or someone else use any art therapy techniques with your patients and if so, does it help? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ztzb?context=5)|Yeah actually we have an art therapist do a group with the kids almost daily, and most of the kids love it and I think it does help them process things that are hard for them to vocalize. That being said most of the adults patients think its bull shit haha.
[Have you ever seen that documentary, Child of Rage? (you can find it on youtube.\) Have you ever had kids who acted in that manner? if so, do you have some examples?

[Ever have a patient be incorrectly diagnosed? What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zb0h?context=5)|Not too often, most of the time people come in with diagnoses they've had  for a while so we don't often do any intial disgnostics. The most common thing though is when someone comes in with depression symptoms, and are given anti-depressants, often times if they are actually bipolar instead of depressed the anit-depressants will make the patient manic.

Often, people start working here and then realize its not what they want for a career. Also develop a thick skin, you will be called every insult imaginable at some point in your career.

On the 3-11 shift, if the kids have outdoor privs, we take them outside for a few hours. After that they have dinner, then a movie, then bedtime's between 8-9 depending on the kids age.

I currently have a System Administrator job at a small eCommerce company with a Salary of 50k a year. I worked my way up from an intern to helpdesk to system admin over the past four years. However, I got a call this morning offering me a job as an Active Directory Admin offering 90k a year + benefits.

**So here are the pros/cons for my current job:**

**PROS**

-Good salary 50k + benefits

-Been here 4 years so I know the network very well

-Very lenient with hours/college.

-Learning all technologies, not just one IT area.

-Know most of the management and they know me.

-Only 10 miles from my house

-Stable in my position, I don't see me being fired or let go soon, however, the CEO made a comment the other day ""Here are the IT guys, we decided not to outsource this department yet.""

**CONS**

-I do everything, network, DNS, DHCP, routing, switching, fiber, SAN. So when something breaks they always bypass everyone and call me, I have become the ""IT guy.""

-Terrible health insurance, almost $300 every two weeks for just me.

-Company is not improving in profit, been about 8 million a year profit for the past 5 or 6 years.






**The Pros and cons for the offered job:**

**PROS**

-Better Salary 90k + benefits

-Fortune 1000 company so much more profitable.

-Better Health Insurance and other benefits (life insurance, cell phone discount)

-Will only be doing Active Directory only, so I only focus on one item.

**CONS**

-Farther away from my house. (about 35 miles)

-I only know one person (guy whom offered it to me)

-Iffy if they will be lenient on my school or not.

-Will it be stable? 

-Still learning powershell and in their job position they state that is a plus. I guess being thrown in head first is a great way to learn it.

-Will only be doing Active Directory, so learning opportunity as a whole is decreased.

Any opinions on the matter, I love learning all the stuff at my job currently. However, I could use the extra money, and I get to learn in-depth active directory (a new car as my current one is about 15 years old).

**EDIT:** I will have a daughter to look after too in about a month. So im trying to decide what is best for me/her. "

Only full time positions are available, no internships, part time, or summer work programs. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

All of our developers have the freedom to pick the best tools to solve the problem at hand. Some specific technologies we like to use include Java 6 (soon to be 7), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, EHCache, PostgreSQL, H2, Web Services (SOAP and REST), Asynchronous messaging, Apache Lucene, Java Server Faces 2, Primefaces, HTML 5, CSS 3, WebSockets, JQuery, Android, Swing, TestNG, Selenium, Maven, JasperReports, Jython, Bash, Geoserver, OpenLayers.

vb9wd,1,2012-06-20,"My mom recently had ~$30,000 worth of jewelry stolen. We have a good idea who's responsible. Police are doing nothing. Please reddit, need some advice!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vb9wd/my_mom_recently_had_30000_worth_of_jewelry_stolen/,"Just got off the phone with her. Might be a little lengthy but here's what I know:

My mom was out of town for Memorial Day Weekend and was gone for about a week. She didn't notice anything was missing until last week when she went looking for some old jewelry. Everything was taken - engagement ring, family heirlooms, bracelets, earrings, GPS, possibly more that's yet to be discovered. Basically every good piece of jewelry she had acquired over 30 years plus some other items. 

She filed a police report and was told she had a detective assigned to the case. After not hearing from anybody for a few days (aren't detectives supposed to come ask questions, check out the scene?), she called in asking for the detective, whose name she had been given, nobody at the station knew who she was talking about - turns out it was an intern. Yes, an intern had been assigned to her case. (Isn't $30k worth of stuff a pretty serious deal?) She has a friend of a friend who works for the sheriff's department. Having this friend inquire about the situation resulted in a very angry call from a real detective who was pissed that she went asking about it. He threatened to just close the case.

Here's what we know concerning the actual robbery. We're pretty sure we know who is responsible:

My mom left a key to her place with one of her best friends of 12 years or so. Wonderful person, definitely not her. This friend, however, had recently taken in someone to their home. This someone is a young 20's female who we know had been kicked out of her home, kicked out of her church. She has a history of drug abuse, prostitution, etc. but we're being told has since ""found God."" My mom's friend &amp; her family are just great people and were willing to take her into their home. This young woman had very easy access to the key, full knowledge of the dates my mother was out of town, etc. Additionally, the circumstances of the theft were such that every object was so meticulously opened, replaced, and looked untouched, that it is obvious the perpetrator knew very well that he/she had plenty of time to do the deed. There are also no signs of forced entry: all of my mom's windows were locked and appeared untouched. The sliding back door had (and still has) a piece of wood preventing entry - it would have taken some SERIOUS work to get through it and would have left clear evidence. The only logical option is that somebody walked through the front door. Even more: the upstairs neighbor knew that my mother was going to be out - a very nice older lady who we're pretty certain couldn't have done it. She reported to my mother that she saw an SUV pull up to the house, two young 20-something females got out and entered my mom's apartment.  This neighbor had just assumed my mom got home early and these girls were helping move in (my mother had moved in only a couple months prior and has been slow in unpacking/removing items from storage). It's seemingly clear who's responsible for this.

Back to the police. My mother was given an ultimatum: she can request that the detective call in my mom's friend for questioning, or just close the case. So we're currently sitting at the detective saying ""Well I'll be out of town for a few days, so I'll probably call in [mom's friend] Friday or maybe Monday."" At best, this leads to questioning of the girl. At worst, that's the end.

Now, we are pretty certain she won't get anything back. Weeks have gone by, things could have been pawned off at any number of locations, etc. But we both feel it's absurd that there is little to no interest being shown by the police. My mom has had her security and privacy violated, has been having nightmares since she found out, and a general paranoia/anxiety. Nothing too serious, but not a good situation.

My advice to her was to, as soon as they close the case and do nothing, go to the media and start a shitstorm that way. She's afraid of getting a bad rap locally and causing the police to shun her in the future should she ever need their help again.

So, reddit, please help! Is there anything we can do? Is this just a lost cause? Is there any chance of justice here?

I'll try to answer any questions based on what I know, but can call her tomorrow and get updates as necessary. Thanks so much ahead of time."
veqm4,1,2012-06-21,How would you approach putting a mediocre project/first work experience on your CV?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/veqm4/how_would_you_approach_putting_a_mediocre/,"I just graduated with a BS in CompSci. During the last semester of my degree, instead of taking classes I did an internship, developing a kind of add-on web application for an existing application the company used.

While I do feel like I learned a lot, I'm not 100% happy with the final product that got deployed. Due to time constraints and, particularly, lack of direction, mentorship, and communication from supervisors that were overseeing my work, I feel like it's not up to the standards of more mature development environments at the bigger companies where I'd like to apply.

Additionally, while I don't think my past employer would say anything very negative about me as a reference, I'm also not sure her recommendation would be glowing, as she didn't seem to like me on a personal level for whatever reason.

So although I *could* link to the github repo and let potential employers browse my work, I'm not sure that's the best idea. Of course, none of my potential employers would know it was an open source project, but if I use my supervisor as a reference (and should I, considering? but wouldn't it also be bad to *not* have a reference from an internship?) but I'm still not sure how to best sell myself and my capabilities with these concerns in mind.

Any tips or thoughts? Thanks in advance."
ve32y,1,2012-06-21,What is your worst affair story?  I need to know I am not alone. ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ve32y/what_is_your_worst_affair_story_i_need_to_know_i/,"This last two years have been living hell for me. I have been through a lot of therapy. I just want to feel like I am not alone right now ... so here is my story first.  I found out in November of 2010 that my husband had been cheating on me with my pregnant really good friend, since before we got married.  She was also our realtor who sold us our house right before our wedding.  She helped me do the wedding favors and pinned the boutonniere on my dad and brother. They started their affair before she got pregnant by everything other than sex in December of 2009 (before the save the date cards went out for my wedding). They made a packed that they wouldn’t leave their significant other and that they would make our two family's really close.  She made herself out to be my best friend after that.  When she found out she was pregnant that meant they could do everything else.  

We got married and she helped me paint my new house.  Things seemed normal through the summer.  She spent a lot of time at our house since her husband was a Doctor doing his internship.  I would pick her up on my way from work and she would stay the night in our extra room.   In September my husband and I started to try and have a baby. She acted so excited and told me I should tell her first and our kids would grow up together.  (luckily I didn't get pregnant)

She had the baby in October and she stopped paying as much attention to my husband (they would have lunch trysts before because she didn't work other than sort of real estate but she only sold two houses one of which was ours) My husband in turn withdrew from me.  I looked at his email after seeing them play footsie under the table as we all (her husband included) played cards and played with the baby.  

My world came crashing down.  She chose to stay with her husband.  My husband said he wanted to stay with me.  So I tried for a while.  We went on a preplanned trip to his family in for Christmas.  He swore he was done with her.  I found out right before we came home on the plane that he was still trying to communicate with her.  I had to fly the whole way back with him sitting next to me.  She wrote him and me a letter stating she wanted no more contact.  She called the cops on my husband.  I was stupid and continued to try to make thing work as he told me he wanted to stay.  He became obsessed with her. He would talk about her and there trysts in detail (to try and get me to leave I think) I did in may after our anniversary when he didn’t try to do anything for it.  She filed a stalking order against him this spring.  I don't have communication with him but it was at the court house I work at.   

The whole thing led to a lot of therapy.  Friends doing intervensions with me because I was saying crazy things.  I paid him off for the house (probably shouldn't it’s a little over my price range but I found the house and did a lot of work on it and I didn't want him to have it because he bought it thinking that he would have a relationship and family with her in it someday.)  So I spent the last year remodeling things myself.  I have become a master at tiling.  Totally re did my kitchen.  Its sort of hands on therapy.  

I have had to come to grips about a lot of things.  The fact that I have gotten older and may never have kids.  The fact that I will never have my big wedding again (my parents paid for the last one and he didn't pay them back).  

But on the good side although probably a little too quick I do have a new boyfriend who treats me very well.  Things are looking up.  I don’t cry going into work everyday,  I don't have panic attacks,  I am starting to see a future again.  

Is there any hope of being with a man who doesn't cheat... I am scared to death that if I marry again I am just setting myself up for failure.

I got a 3.5 unweighted GPA sophomore year of HS (two honors classes) and a 3.9 unweighted GPA junior year (5 on AP physics c electricity mag, 4 on AP physics mech, 5 in AP compsci, 5 in AP calc bc). 2150 SAT, 800 math II, 760 Physics. Extracurriculars were cross country and competitive pokemon TCG. I applied under the computer science major (which was probably not a smart move) and got rejected.

So yeah, I'm going to either davis or santa barbara for computer science.

A couple of things that I *already* have going for me is that I got an internship at a Silicon Valley startup literally a few weeks after I submitted my UC Application, been working there for 6 months. I get paid $20/hr but I might get a raise to $30 soon. The startup is doing really well and is expanding very quickly. When I started we had 11 employees, now we have 60.

Yeah, so for the transfer applicants for computer science at UCLA, how hard did you have to work to get to that position? What kind of GPA did you have to get / extracurriculars / etc?"

Now, my mother is not a bad person, not at all, she fought for me all my life. She ran away from my insane abusive father when I was a baby, and ended up homeless. Then her cancer returned, yet by herself she managed to juggle radiotherapy and caring for me. She really sacrificed alot.

However, I've always paid the price, we have no family or friends, I put up with her guilt trips, her caring needs, her hatred of me having ""middle class aspirations"", going to uni, wanting to do well for myself, wanting to live at home, not wanting to live at home, it goes on.

OKAY HERE'S WHERE I NEED ADVICE - My uni offered me to apply for a paid internship which would be invaluable to me, not to mention paid, as me and my mum struggle financially, this would allow me to do it.

This sent her, in short insane and abusive. She's been drinking very heavily of recent and this was tipping point. She has decided that if I take this one month internship away from her she's downsizing to one bedroom place because I clearly don't need her anymore.

If I mention friends she says I value them over her and I should live with them.  She screams down the phone day and night, destroys my things, demanding all the money I have from me and seems to take pleasure from throwing me on the street and telling me I'm awful as I try and look after her.

My question is, what do I do? I have no savings, she has drained me dry for bills. I abide by her rules, but I have no real life or prospects as I am expected to stay here forever and care.

If I stay here, I may be kicked onto the streets anyway, and that would mean I couldn't continue my education (which she says I should experience because she never did) and there are no jobs even to take as an alternative.

I feel awful asking, but I feel sheltered, hopeless, scared and unprepared for ending up on the street because of her issues."

vg2cz,1,2012-06-22,I'm a senior in college and I still have no idea what I want to do with myself after school. I'm in need of some advice or suggestions.,DarkEpsilon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vg2cz/im_a_senior_in_college_and_i_still_have_no_idea/,"Hi reddit. As the titles says I am a senior in college at SUNY Cortland, and I have no idea what I want to do professionally after school. As a bit of background information, I started as a Physics / Mechanical Engineer dual major at Cortland, but the workload was much more than I have anticipated after just coming out of high school. Needless to say it didn't work in my favor and I changed majors to Sociology with a minor in Computer Science. It was a difficult decision for me, and a very drastic change from physics. I really do enjoy learning about Sociology, but have no idea what I could do with it after school. I am currently floating on a 3.4 GPA in the sociology major, but from poor grades from some physics it looks to be much lower. I am going to spend next summer at school to retake the courses that need improvement to help myself if I decide to go to graduate school. 

I have thought long and hard about what I want to do, and still have come up with nothing. I have no idea what I think is best for me, or what interests me enough to pursue. 

At school I have taken a few courses in Computer Science to see if that can take me somewhere, because I know that it does interest me a lot, but I fear for job security. I have taken a visual basic course, and html 4 course and really enjoyed them, but it took me a long time to get used to a different type of thinking. In one of my sociology classes I had to create my own study about consumerism which was fun, but I don't think being a researcher is something that interests me enough. 

My father is a homicide detective in Manhattan, and knows a good deal of people and has good connections with them. I have thought about becoming a detective before but am still unsure about it. If I did follow through on it, I would be able to start off better then others in whatever precinct I would want to be in. My father also works construction as a second job whenever hes off, and I have been working for him since I was around the age of 12. I work for him every summer and it is how I make my money at the moment, and help pay for school. 

I have also thought about law school for myself, and think I would like it, but at the same time I know nothing of law and feel that I am in no way prepared to get into any schools without any prier knowledge. Again, my father has told me about his childhood friend who is now a very powerful lawyer who is willing to give me advice and maybe even some kind of internship over the summer. I have no idea what I would have to do, or if he would be willing to allow it so I haven't gone through on that either.

As you can see I have no clue of what is going on around me, and no idea what I want to do. I'm asking you, /r/AskReddit, for any advice or suggestions that could in any way benefit me in my situation. I'll try my best to answer any questions you have.

tl;dr: Have no idea what I want to do with myself after school. Sociology major with minor in computer science. Father has connections in police department, and with a lawyer friend. Law school possibility? Need advice."

vf7tt,15,2012-06-22,Is College Worth It Professionally?,mxmm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vf7tt/is_college_worth_it_professionally/,"Just for background, I'm studying at Cornell as a rising sophomore in Computer Science and Math, and I have absolutely no intention of dropping out, I just wanted to see what you guys think.

What made me think about this is the comments on this /r/programming topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ve31x/so_you_dropped_out_of_college_after_gaining_some/

The way the top comments talk down on education was a little surprising to me, as if it would be better for me to drop out now and get experience than to finish college. I mean, I am working as a programmer this summer and fully plan to shoot for a good internship next summer, which it seems my school would facilitate. As for background, I was really more of a math geek in high school who decided to learn Java 2 weeks before university, and so far I love the courses and have done well in what are usually considered the ""weeder"" courses, so I'm pretty sure graduating with a good GPA is feasible, if this matters in your advice. 

After going to university for a year and developing this summer for almost a month so far, I feel like I know infinitely more than I did a year ago, and can't really imagine understanding the theoretical basis of what I'm doing as well from self-study (I'd have neither the resources nor the motivation), and I can't imagine having as many big-name companies looking for internships in one room at one time in my hometown.

I'm sorry if this post sounds somewhat gloatful, since that honestly wasn't the purpose. I just want to put down all the reasons I feel like getting this education would be useful as long as I'm not putting a ridiculous financial burden on myself. However, many members of this website would imply just the opposite, and I'm curious to see what points I'm probably ignoring here. After all, I do come from a culture that puts a lot of value on education, so my opinions are likely quite biased.

Thanks."

In addition to gaming, this will be used for various work related things - I often run several VMs at a time, use Photoshop a lot, do a bit of video encoding, and sometimes even launch Adobe Reader...hence why I went with an i7 instead of the i5. On that note, should I stick with LGA 1155 or switch to an i7-3820 and find an LGA 2011 motherboard? The prices seem pretty similar.

~~Concerning the SSD, there is an ""OCZ Intern 120GB Agility 3 Series"" available for cheaper but some reviews said that it's a fair bit slower than most SSDs. Plus, Intel sounds a lot more trustworthy. Or is there an even better alternative?~~ EDIT: As suggested, switched to the Samsung 830.

Unfortunately, since I live in Sweden, the sweet deals on Newegg are out of my reach. I have labeled the components with the local prices here. It would be much appreciated if y'all could look over my list and check that I'm not inadvertently creating any sort of bottlenecks or getting hugely mismatched components. Thanks! :)

I've just finished up my first wave of actual IT classes that went over network security, java programming, html, and css. I’ve started learning a little c++ on my own and I'll be taking a class on android application development in the fall.  I plan on spending as much free time as I can picking up either php or javascript and getting into more advance concepts in java during the coming semester.  I've been using photoshop for over 8 years and love designing things for organizations at school whenever I can such as flyers, business cards, banners, websites, and whatever they want as far as advertisement goes.
 I've been looking for internships or jobs where I can get some solid experience programming or doing anything really that is computer related. I have spent hours upon hours scanning craigslist, monster, and even physical newspapers o_O looking for jobs in the field and I do not qualify for what seem the most basic of positions.  Everybody wants people with experience, and many of these part time jobs require experience in things that I'm not even sure I will get taught by the time I graduate and thus I have turned to reddit for advice.
I realize that my degree program itself will not teach me everything I need to know to get a decent job right out of college and that I will just have to teach myself the things that are missing. Fortunately I am well acquainted with the methods of online learning and have no problems figuring out where to go to learn what I want. The problem is I don’t know what I need to learn exactly and don’t want to waste time on stuff that won’t really add to my “hire-ability”. I know that a strong foundation in any language will make picking up other languages easier but as I said what I want to learn now is basically whatever it takes to get my foot into the door so that I can get some experience and maybe something worth putting on a resume.  
What are the things that I can pick up that will help me land that first job in the field? Is there some place that I’m not thinking of that can help me find a job that is computer related?
Thanks for any advice you can offer. 
TL;DR IT major with basic programming skills, wants to know what to learn/do to get that will help get that first job.

[Hi. you have done a great job with Reddit. Reddit is unique and has raised a very outstanding community which can be never found in the internet. And I love it!  What made you start a website like this? what was your inspiration?  What do you think about the current Reddit community? Is Reddit now as exactly as you imagined? or do you expect anything more from the current community?  How do you think the future of Reddit will be? and what do you expect the future to be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542dso?context=5)|Thank you. But to be fair, this thing has grown *far* beyond what Steve and I started in that Medford apartment with. Sure, we can take credit for starting the planter box, tilling the soil, adding seeds, and watering, etc, but it's since grown into a freaking ecosystem.      We jumped at the chance, took the next train back to Boston and met with him for about an hour. He pushed us to drop mobile (it was 05) and think about a web app that we'd personally want to use every day. We left that meeting with a phrase in our heads that PG crafted ""front page of the internet."" Then it was just up to me and Steve to make it.      At the time, we were intrigued by delicious/popular, which was an interesting byproduct of their bookmarking service. Incidentally, we didn't learn about digg until weeks after we launched. It goes to show how much our ignorance helped, because you may remember all the blatant digg-clones that came and went before digg did -- Steve and I weren't trying to just copy, we were thinking about solving this problem from a clean slate.  I need to get better at distinguishing between the many varied reddit *communities*. The culture &amp; community on /r/NBA is very different from the culture on /r/aww and reddit is just the platform that enables such varied discourse. Steve and I always debated about subreddits vs tagging and I'm happy he won, because although it's taken longer to grow and develop, it's resulted in this marvelous variety in communities all using this common platform. So in a way, all of these varied communities are what we'd hoped for, but we've still got a ways to go until the reddit platform really is the ubiquitous way online communities share and discover content.
[Out of curiosity, what was the idea with tagging?

[Now that subreddits are established you should introduce a system that allows the same post to be submitted to a number of subreddits, but only appear on someone's front page or /r/all once.

[What are your thoughts on the subreddit SRS? I know most people will view this from a ""lost karma"" perspective, but I don't care about karma, I mean from the perspective that a lot of thoughts and ideas are downvoted and never seen because this group doesn't agree with their thoughts. In my opinion, it kind of kills the spirit of reddit.  Also, what are your thoughts on subreddits like /r/picsofdeadkids and /r/beatingwomen (or whatever its called\)? Do you feel that these are ruining the credibility of the site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fn4?context=5)|I, like most, find people who use the reddit platform for awful stuff to be awful people. Just like [@deadbabygoon](https://twitter.com/#!/deadbabygoon) *(I didn't spend much time looking but this is rather offensive)* doesn't ruin the credibility of twitter, I don't see why these awful reddits would ruin the credibility of the reddit platform.
[Do you feel like there is enough sexism/racism/homophobia etc on Reddit to warrant a subreddit like SRS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5433pp?context=5)|I think there's enough sexism/racism/homophobia in the world to warrant people calling it out when it happens.

 |The biggest product enhancement reddit needs atm imho is subreddit discovery, which we're working on. That'll be a glorious day when we nail it.

 |Oh, and cats. Please spay &amp; neuter!
[I recently read about how you and Steve made hundreds of fake accounts at the beginning to get the site going.

Maybe tens. I don't have a good enough memory. We submitted links (there were no comments back then) for the first month or so while we bugged friends into helping. The day about a month an a half in when we didn't have to do anything, submit a link, or even vote, was awesome, because we'd set a tone and apparently people didn't hate. it. I'm always telling people about the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) and why it's so important to treat those first hundred users well.
 |Remember, there was no 'social media' to speak of back in 2005, so all I had to spread the word was begging small bloggers to do writeups about a company they'd never heard of with a misspelled name and silly mascot.

I even got taunted by a guy at an /r/NYC meetup a little while back because he asked how long I'd been using reddit and I said I'd been a user for quite some time, joking that it was ""before reddit was popular.""
[How long did it take you guys to reach 10k users? Is there a chart somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5443ke?context=5)|Oof.

[Well I guess the anger could come because of hipsters really. I met a hipster not too long ago in the nearest city to me, complete with ironic hat &amp; glasses, and I found him ridiculous.

[Do you think you have become an inspiration to many young      Armenian and Armenian-Americans.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I don't know. I did an interview with [Yerevan Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEAsrMzjnu0) and another [Armenian publication](http://www.haytoug.org/1755/alexis-ohanian-gains-perspective-in-yerevan). I grew up in a suburb of Maryland where I didn't know many Armenians so I was rather isolated from that half of my identity. I knew the history (and food!) of course, but I grew up far from Glendale. I actually know the community in Yerevan better from my 3 months living there. But if I can inspire, that's awesome. I get inspired by people I don't even know on reddit every day.
[What type of influence did the Armenian Culture have in your career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I hate to bring it back to the genocide, but knowing what sacrifices my relatives made was incredibly motivating. As is the case with many immigrant stories, it creates invaluable perspective. I got to go out-of-state to UVA ($$$) without a single student loan because my great aunt, Vera Ohanian, saved money all her life for my college fund. She had no children of her own and wanted to be sure that I could go anywhere I wanted for college. So you can be damned sure that when I got to UVA, I took full advantage of the tuition. That's why I double majored in business and history (with high honors) and minored in german. I was told by deans that they'd never seen anyone complete a distinguished majors degree in the college *and* a degree in the business school and a minor to boot, all in 4 years.
[What is the greatest thing you experienced when you visited Armenia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|But maybe they didn't meet many Armenians ;) we're tenacious.

I hope I can do great things as an Armenian just like you! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I must've eaten it every other day in Armenia. I don't eat a lot of meat these days, but as a general rule I wish 'the typical American diet' were less based around packaged and fast food. [The long-term effects of this](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html) are going to be awful.
[Here's an interview he did about the story of reddit, and some of his personal life. One of the best interviews I've seen. Really hit me hard for some reason.  **Edit:** Here's a text version of the story written by Alexis himself. It's really a touching story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54373y?context=5)|Ah, thanks, that was the first time I was ever asked about my mom. I don't talk about it a lot. The whole thing was pretty cathartic. I was happy I did it.
[Having been through ""mom has cancer"" and ""daughter has cancer"", dude...you are an inspiration.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543za1?context=5)|Fuck. I'm so sorry.

[That's a lot to go through, especially when rolling out a huge site like this. You've got my respect for sure! Also cancer sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543kcj?context=5)|It does. I'd had such a great, stress-free life until that summer.

[Do you get a lot of pressure to more effectively monetize Reddit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542lfo?context=5)|I'm the one putting pressure on our CEO, Yishan :)
 |In all seriousness though, we never want to sacrifice the community for revenue. We've grown (costs) slowly by having a small team and I believe we can keep that up while also responsibly growing the business.
 |Stay tuned. Yishan and the team have some nifty ideas...
[When it started did you ever have any wild ideas in how you might monetize or was it really all about creating something people love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c544zl2?context=5)|We thought if we could in fact become 'the front page of the web' it'd be valuable real estate to advertise on. Little did investors know we'd want to be so good to our users and not have obnoxious ads ;)
 |But sponsored headlines have been a not-awful way to make money in that they both make money and it's not an awful user experience (sometimes actually kinda fun with commenting).
[How have you seen reddit gold play in to this monetization? Is it an actual source of revenue or is it more like a fun optional ""proudly show your support for reddit"" kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54be3h?context=5)|More of the latter. But it's given us some great ideas because of how it's gifted. I totally stole the idea from Drew Curtis btw (Total Fark) - he's a gentleman about it.

And it gets harder each round because quality and volume go up. I'm not actually the best person at YC to ask because I don't have nearly as much data as the partners. But we want to see a team we can believe in, which we largely gather from what they've built together in the past. It's not a science, though, and it continues to impress me that YC has had consistently great rounds of startups (FD: I'm an employee of YC and [investor in a bunch of startups](http://alexisohanian.com/pages/investments))
[Do you think it's necessary to move out to the bay area to be successful in today's startup world? What are some other great places to work on a tech-related startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542sac?context=5)|Definitely not! We started and sold reddit from Medford and Somerville, MA! And I live in NY now not just because I was born here and family is close and I love New York, but it's also a great place to do a startup. Only downside is our Mexican food isn't as good as SF, but I'm dealing with that.

Not just their butter/garlic stuff, but also ranch, and then some really random (not good) stuff... cheese sauce.... 
[Had no idea -- but then again, I've never eaten Papa John's in my entire life. I've had Dominos more times than any human should. Their deep-dish pizza is disgustingly good. Also, their cheesy bread, holy shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542gk3?context=5)|I was a Pizza Hut dishwasher/cook/waiter through most of high school. After I left, I never ate there again. I'd always been partial to PJ, but recently tried the new Domino's - everything went better than expected. I might give it a second go. I live in Brooklyn, though, so it's my guilty pleasure to order delivery PJ's from time to time. Please don't tell anyone or post this knowledge on a public forum.

Yes, pun threads win the day in the more mainstream subreddits, but take a look somewhere like /r/askscience. It's pretty awesome.

Launching hipmunk compared to reddit was night and day because of all the different ways people can now share awesome things. Granted, there's more competition, but it's only gotten cheaper and easier to get something going (e.g., we had to order servers from newegg, build them, and install them in the colo facility back in 2005 -- now just AMEX the AMZN EC2/S3 account or just heroku it!)

[Yowza that made the tears stream pretty freely, it does lead to another question though, had circumstances been different and your mother health not been an issue would you have held onto reddit longer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543lcm?context=5)|Maybe. But the benefit of hindsight and experience would've had even more of an impact. Ultimately, I don't spend a second wondering. I've been really fortunate with the way things turned out (and continue to turn out). No regrets.
[Ignoring the internet drama portions, you have to admit that ""witchhunting"" is a rather serious flaw in the community and site. The fact that users can be targeted and effectively silenced with a sea of downvotes solely because the community hates them (because of legitimate reasons or misunderstandings\) is a violation of redditquette on a massive scale.

[One thing I really admire is that you've seemed to stay so level-headed throughout all the media coverage and success that you've had- is this difficult?

I don't think too much about my public image but what you're telling me could be a lot worse ;)
 |All of the live TV coverage SOPA/PIPA brought was a great education in how to deliver a message in a short time period to a distracted audience.

I look for safety schools for a CS PhD in the US that is good for theory. I lean toward algorithms kind of theory, especially computational geometry, but complexity is also ok.

If I was asking for general CS, I would expect to see lot of answers. CS Theory is so ignored in this subreddit, I have seen so many questions about what to do to get internships, but none about how CS theory undergraduate can progress to their next destination.

I have a [cv](http://chaoxuprime.com/files/cv.pdf) if it helps one determine what level is a safety school for me.

Here is a list of schools I have considered:

1: MIT, Cornell, CMU (5% chance)

2: Georgia Tech, Berkeley, UIUC, Brown (20% chance)

3: UW–Madison, Rutgers (50% chance)

Safety: Stony Brook, Clemson. (90% chance)

The problem is that there is a large gap in between 3 and safety, the only reason I know about the 2 safety school is because I have actually been there. "
vj25s,1,2012-06-24,America to (almost) Anywhere,Hollow_Hills,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/vj25s/america_to_almost_anywhere/,"I've been kicking the idea around for years now and I've realized I really need to start forming a real plan if I'm to actually ever get out. 
Like most other people it seems, Western Europe/Australia/NZ are the top choices but I'd definitely consider other options.

Relevant Info:

Age : 27 (female if that makes a difference)

Education : Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, recently returned to school to get a Bachelor's in Bio-Molecular Engineering. 

Real Job Skills : Extensive customer service work (i.e. retail and fast food peon). I do have basic computer skills like Office and Excel but who doesn't these days. I can pick up necessary skills pretty fast but obviously I don't have anything to really set me apart from most people in the 15+ age groups these days. You can see part of why I'm back in school!

Language Skills : Very basic French- I'm willing to learn more of it or any other languages if it will help. I can also sort of guess at written German and Dutch if it's very simple stuff for whatever that's worth.

Criminal Convictions : None

Alternative Destinations: YES

Temp. or Permanent: Permanent

I'd also like to mention that though I'm in school for Bio-Molecular Engineering, I've only just started so I'm at a point where switching majors to something more likely to help me get out would be considered. Most specifically I'm nursing as other engineering disciplines don't really grab me as much and healthcare workers are always needed. (I don't get very excited about the idea of being a nurse though. But if it gets me out....) A general Chemical Engineering degree (what I'm going for now is an offshoot of that ) would be ok but I'd need to switch schools and I can't really afford to live on my own right now. I could commute but it'd be harder to have a job and still keep up with school that way. If necessary, I could even just have my degree as a back-up and teach English in SE Asia or something. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible if it can help me get out!

Another thing I feel I should mention, as I don't know how it may or may not affect my chances is my health. I have asthma, but am otherwise in good shape. Would something like that hurt my chances or are there any precautions I would need to take with it while getting out? It's something that I need to make sure is taken care of because without medicine to control it my asthma can become a problem.

One more thing: School outside of the US is likely not feasible for me at this point. It's cheap enough for the school but the money required to travel over is not something I have. If I found something that was essentially guaranteed my family *might* help but as it stands they're in some weird mindset that leaving America is harder than walking to the moon. Even trying to talk to them about it seems to get them irritated and they go all doom and gloom and I just get frustrated.  I do have the option of an exchange program next summer in France but I don't know how much that would help me in getting out unless I was able to make some awesome connections in the space of a month. (Or if  an exchange program would be helpful to this goal at all). I'd consider an overseas internship, but I don't know if such things really exist. (If they do I imagine they aren't easy to get either!)

Anyway, I hope my post makes sense and that at least a few of you can give me good and useful advice.

vip4r,0,2012-06-24,"Stuck in an internship job I hate, trying to get unstuck.",kevtice15,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/vip4r/stuck_in_an_internship_job_i_hate_trying_to_get/,"So on Monday, I will start the 4th week of a 10 week internship I have at a big tech company (by big I mean global, 10s of 1000s of employees, jobs for people to do in pretty much all areas of CS) that will remain unnamed.  I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May and I will begin a graduate program in the fall.  The company sent out a spreadsheet to all the interns a few months ago with a list of all the groups in the company taking interns and asked us to fill our top 7 into a survey.  I get an email the week before the internship starts saying I'm going to be in a group that isn't even on the list, so I can't even check to see what the group I got placed in does.  But I figure, whatever, I'll see what happens, maybe I'll enjoy it.  A bit of backstory: &lt;backstory&gt; in my last semester of my CS degree, I took a class about data communications and network programming.  I learned a lot about networks themselves, but the biggest and most important lesson I learned is that I don't like network programming, and I'm not very good at it.  The class was a struggle and I praised Turing when the class was over. &lt;/backstory&gt;  When I arrive on the first day of my internship, my manager, after thanking me for picking this group, begins to explain to what it is I have to do.  Of course of all things, this group deals HEAVILY with network programming (if you're familiar, specifically the Data Link and Network layers of the OSI model, so pretty low level stuff).  My heart drops. I can't help but wonder how this has happened.  Firstly how the internship coordinators could not place me in any of my SEVEN choices.  And secondly, even if I really, for some reason, just could not have one of my SEVEN CHOICES, how did I have the intense misfortune of being placed in a group that deals heavily with one of the only topics in CS that I could not bring myself to enjoy in any way.  Even after this meeting, I try to have a positive outlook. Having a job isn't class, so maybe network programming in the real world could be fun.  They proceed to have me read documents to get me up to speed on what I'll be working on.  So I read ... every day ... 8 hours a day ... for 3 weeks ... about network programming ... in which I have utterly no interest.  Then at the end of the 3rd week, I have another meeting with my manager and he gives me my actual assignment (which I'm purposely not going to explain), and it sounds like the 5th circle of my personal hell.  I feel like I made a big mistake not trying to get transfered to another group in the first week because 1) I don't know what other managers would be willing to take an intern for 6 weeks, and 2) I don't know how good of an internship experience I'm likely to have even if I switch.  I wake up everyday with a huge sigh and struggle to get myself ready to be at work on time. I really feel like I'm not going to be able to do this and I don't know what I should do.  Should I tell my manager that I hate my job so he can at least know even if I'm unable to switch?  Would it be worth it to switch?  Any insights into a course of action would be much appreciated.

tl;dr - Lost the internship lottery at a big company, hate my job, 6 weeks left, should I try to get them to switch me to a new job?"

I'm just finishing up my second year (at community college..) and transferring to a UC to continue. 

Currently the CS-related courses I have taken are: Intro to C++ (two quarters), Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in C++ (one quarter). C as a second language (one quarter), Intro to UNIX/Linux.

I don't currently find any of these skills useful as no one is looking to pay me to create a program they can run in a console... 

I also noticed that most employers of interns are looking for either Python/Django experience or Java/Javscript experience... So what the hell am I doing with C++??

Furthermore, what can I work on this Summer, and which courses should I sign up for (this coming school year) so that next Summer I will be able to actually flex my CS muscles and get a powerful internship?

Some other ideas I have thought about was diving into Android App development. Where do I even start with this? I know it doesn't use C++ (I believe its Java based?), so would I need to start learning Java? What else? How long will learning this take? 

Also any other idea on how I can make money with my major before I graduate?

I've graduated recently from a Boston university with a degree in Marketing Communication. I have extensive internship experience with a  well-known Boston agency as a Media Buyer. I have experience with DDS, am highly proficient with excel, and know my way around MS Office. My experience is predominantly traditional media: specifically broadcast with some radio, promotions, and online, but I am up for a challenge and ready to learn! I know the basics of AdWords and have worked with GoogleGrants but I am not certified. I also know the basics of Facebook ads and a bit about promoted tweets. 

In addition to internships, I managed to hold down several jobs on campus (all marketing and social media centric) while maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have also worked on several accounts through NSAC, a national student marketing competition via AAF. 

Beyond that I'm an energetic person that loves meeting new people and learning new skills. I can (and WILL) teach myself any skills necessary to my job. I have a passion for media and knowing what makes people tick/ why marketing works.

I've been searching for months (job posting sites, LinkedIn, Alumni job listings, even newspapers) and have had several interviews but nothing has panned out. I'm becoming a bit worried I won't find something. I'm looking for any entry-level marketing leads in Boston. Tell me if you want to know more! I would love to network with people in the area.

vk0a2,4,2012-06-24,Suicidal Thoughts. Thought a reddit post might help.,AlmostBreakingPoint,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vk0a2/suicidal_thoughts_thought_a_reddit_post_might_help/,"**TL/DR  college graduate. No job, no call-backs, loans about to default, stressed out too much, looking for advice** 
So, here's the gist of things, and this may or may not be a throwaway account. I have graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree a year ago. After an internship, I stayed at my sister and her family's to help watch her kids while I searched for a full-time job. I would like to point out her husband works full time, she worked and took college classes, and she was pregnant. Now, after baby complications (sick baby) the kid is doing allright, and I have had several decent interviews. 
However, here are the biggest problems. I am not getting hired, anywhere. My nest egg for rainy days has now reached near empty, loans (90k at least) are near defaulting, I am basically mooching off her and her family, and I can't even get a minimum wage job.
I would like to point out that I love my sister and the rest of my family. I am beyond appreciative of how she has been willing to put up with me for this long. She, however, doesn't think I am looking hard enough, despite looking for both jobs for my degree and any minimum wage job I can get in the mean time. I can see her point of view of all of this. If I had the money, I would move in with my brother and hope job prospects are better where he is.
Here's the thing though. I can put up a good front, but I am psychologically fragile. I have no close friends, and barely keep in touch with anyone, besides random Facebooking. Nobody realizes how often I think of suicide. Wrists, drowning (convenient river nearby), car accident, window jumping, I've thought of ways and ways. and my sister has passive aggressive down to an art, so I end up talking to my bro-in-law, who is waaay too understanding, and has it rough being between the two of us. 
I know the reasons not to. Mostly, right now, it's that my sister's kids are used to their uncle and I wouldn't want them to see it, let alone deal with it. I also don't want one of my bros being stuck with the loan they co-signed for (+4k).  I've always told people, but I do't think they realized how serious I was, that one of the reasons I haven't gone through with it is that I'm too curious. About what's happening next in a book, seeing a new movie, wondering if I might actually get a date sometime soon. *sigh* and it doesn't help that whenever I start to get too upset after thinking about all of this, I get physically ill. I get flushed and heated, nauseous, and my throat burns. Sometimes it gets so I have to leave and go walking around at night to get tired enough to rest.  
So there you have it. Any advice, beyond the obvious ""don't do it!"" ? I've had thoughts like this before, but never this strong and this sustained. I'm not good with speaking about my feelings, especially with family. We've never been that type. And mom and dad passed away a few years ago. I've thought about joining the army but not sure how much that would help me out.
I should be on for another hour, and will probably check this again in the morning.
*edited in* I should also point out that along with all this, I have no health insurance and am currently getting teeth pain. I probably have a cavity or two, despite dental hygiene, which occasional pain doesn't help me much either.

**1hour gone**
So, not sure how to add the new little post below this, so just editing in here. I'm tired and my eyes are heavy so I think I will sleep now. Will respond to anything new when I wake... I should also point out that the past two nights I've had nightmares... and I haven't dreamed anything before this in several months. So this doesn't help my mental health much either. Thanks for the current responders, even if I can't yet and am unsure how to post this in the SW subreddit. Hopefully I will feel a little better in the morning."

While the college diploma would help connect me with an internship and help me enter the work force faster, I feel that it might limit me in my career growth.

Most of the 'good' job postings I have seen all require a BSc which makes me lean towards that route.  There are a couple of large companies in Toronto which could be potential employers (Ubisoft &amp; IBM off the top of my head)

I'm really hitting a brick wall with my classes, and it's not because of effort. I came into university at age 20 with a severe lack of math and science skills (no substantial knowledge of math past algebra I), but somehow made it through the first 2 years on time for the most part. I was able to pull off a lot of A's and B+'s in the Calc sequence, in some of my Chem classes, etc. I've always worked hard. But I feel like i'm falling apart as I move into the actual engineering courses. I have gone from a B- to C+ and now a D in the ChemE classes i've been in (the D is a class I am currently enrolled in, Thermo). Last semester I get an A- and B+ in Multivariable calc and Diff Eq, but the C+ in energy balances. If you look at my GPA outside of engineering, it is wonderful (outside of Orgo 1, but i'm doing great the second time around, i'm taking that as well this summer).

I'm trying, i've readjusted my study patterns. My notebook is filled with notes in completely logical manner, split up by class notes, quizzes, online notes, etc. But I always fuck up on the quizzes that make up most of our grade, and it's just starting to eat at me. I basically have to start getting consistent 10's or I might fail... which will set me back a whole year with regards to graduation since the fall class is already full. I've been just as confused and frustrated in Calc and Physics before, yet found a way to get a good grade. I somehow got a B+ in Physics I while simultaneously learning Trigonometry. In the actual engineering courses, I never improve, it's like I have 600 puzzle pieces and i'm always missing a few pieces to complete the puzzle.

I feel guilty beyond all belief for so many reasons. My mom is paying for my college, and I went to community college for two years before university (tried accounting, my mom forced me to go). I feel like if I am able to graduate, it'll take 7-8 years at best at this rate. I also have a lot of stress in my personal life since I am transitioning from male to female, and have no idea how I am going to actually come out, or when, and how to correlate that to my classes. Or if my internship will even want me to stick around if I came out.

I have just finished my first year of University studying Computer Science in the United Kingdom, after seeing so many people on my course it's really motivated me to set myself aside from everyone else come the end of the third and final year.



From my understanding, the best way to achieve this is through Intern ships, personal projects, open-source involvement and a display of passion.



Firstly, my University is teaching us Java, I believe actual coding only goes on until the end of the second year so I am eager to leave Java behind as it's continually stapled as a bad language to get into programming jobs (my desired field).



Now, Internships - specifically in the UK, how do these work? and how do I get involved? I've also seen people mention working for your Universities research department but I don't know how likely that is to happen. 

Personal Projects - Got ideas up my sleeve, but waiting to make the change over to C++ before I start making anything worthy of showcasing.

Open-Source: With my limited knowledge set of programming as of yet, how do I go about getting involved in open-source projects? I've looked through a few and they're all very very much out of my league. 


Thank you very much for your time, appreciate any replies and comments you have."
vn2tp,3,2012-06-26,First Programming Interview,seyfarth,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vn2tp/first_programming_interview/,"Hey guys,

I'm fresh out of college with an MIS degree and am interviewing for an entry-level programming position.

I've been working in databasing and business intelligence throughout my internships, with various one-off projects done in C#, Javascript, etc.

Any solid advice for interviewing without much real-world programming experience? I do have plenty of real-world experience for a recent grad (linkedin: http://www.linkedin.com/in/tonylechner )"
vmxbv,3,2012-06-26,Domain Upgrade,haggeant,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vmxbv/domain_upgrade/,"Dear sysadmin,

I am interning for the summer at a small business and they want to do a Domain Upgrade this summer. We have about 30 users, and I have just a couple of questions. What do you recommend for Anti-Virus, Backup Software/Method. I am sure I have hardware right as my specs have been on par with what consultants are recommending. One consultant thought backup to disk was fine, and the other thought it was ridiculous and the only way to go was tape. I was thinking it would be reasonable to use our DC with raid 5, w/ hot spare, and a NAS w/ raid 1 for backup storage. I understand the want for storing data off site, but our off-site storage is only a mile away. The building is a new brick building with excellent fire suppression, we don't get tornadoes often (southwest Wisconsin), the it room is in the same room as the severe weather shelter, and if it floods 1000 feet above sea level we have bigger problems. 

Do any of you know of a good Domain Upgrade Checklist so I can be sure I haven't missed anything in the install plan.

Thanks,
Intern"

**Facts**

I am in the technology field, and have been working mid-level positions for about 5 years. I have about 6 months of community college under my belt before I dropped out and started working full-time. I also have a fiance and a 2 year old I am supporting. I make enough to survive, but not enough to break away from living check-to-check or save much of anything.

**Decision**

I've been feeling super stagnant the past year, I've been drowning hours into a salaried position with no recognition and falling off the cutting edge of my field do to my family demands and all around exhaustion. This led me to start looking for a new job on the side. I sent my resume out to a few places, and one of my old colleges from my first job noticed. He works for a prominent start-up in my field.

I said what the heck and interviewed. Five 1 1/2 hour phone interviews later, I got an offer. They really like me, but feel that I need a bit more polish before they can accept me for the full-time gig. Their offer, a paid internship for &lt; 6 months with the option of that full-time job I was shooting for. The job is in San Fran (re: $$$$) and I am in suburbia ($$) across the country, 2 months into a lease with 2 dependents. I haven't replied yet, but the full time gig came with a relocation package, I'm not sure if this does, and how this would be feasible or safe for my family.

So I ask, what would you do? I will online all day today."

I want to end things.,ThrowAway89625,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vmbm2/how_do_you_deal_with_losing_the_love_of_your_life/,"I'm honestly thinking about ending things. The love of my life broke up with me right before I went off for an internship. Things were bad, the trust was broken, and it wasn't healthy. It's been a month now. I've never met, and after trying to date again, feel like I never will meet someone who was so beautiful and a great match for me personality wise. She was just too proud and didn't handle conflict well, and us not being able to handle conflict led to the demise of our relationship. It's tragic. I'm not sure that I want to live without her. I have everything in the world going for me aside from this, but I can't convince myself that it is worth it without someone I loved so much. I'm a mess, I feel like I can never love someone again. I'm still in love with this person. She has my dog and still some of my things and we haven't talked in a month so it would be a clean break. I just want to end things. Sometimes I feel good about myself again when I'm in blind denial about losing someone I loved so much and block out that she existed, but times like now are just so disheartening that I don't want to live."

[What does a vagina look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55afe7?context=5)|Actually relative to the course of humanity, no question is more relevant for a man to know definitively.
 |But knowing what it looks like is less important than knowing how to get there. And if long-term enjoyment is your objective, you also need to figure out how to stay.
[Also, what do you think of Dell's announcement that they're going to move away from consumer computers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ams1?context=5)|Every few years, Dell says they want to move away from low-margin consumer PC where they can't make much money.
[Isn't HP pretty much in the same boat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55erbf?context=5)|Yes, but they're #1 and do a lot of other things.
[But what's the long term value in remaining in that market? It seems applications and content are where it's at. A company that can support that growing sector with enterprise hardware and services has an advantage over a company that puts too much into consumer hardware, especially as Apple slowly takes that space away. Wouldn't Dell want to make that move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fzxy?context=5)|I think so, but have to do it via M&amp;A since Dell has almost zero R&amp;D in house.
[Their enterprise services are basically being eaten away by Oracle and they are widely viewed as less competent than IBM.  They are #1 in the printer market but isn't that a shrinking market due to tablets etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55hebt?context=5)|Services - they have some work to do, but the infrastructure is all there. Need to rebuild their bench of talent and wrap up all the bad contracts signed under Hurd.  Networking is a decent business and they are maintaining their position there.
 |Printer is in secular decline, but a very strong cash generation business in the mean time.
[Do you have any insight of the workflow how such incompetent pricks end up in the high level management of tech companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Quite often, the guy in the CEO's chair was (a) extremely lucky at some point in his career, and (b) stuck around long enough to get full credit for it. My opinion of most corporate executives is pretty jaded after having met so many of them. But doing their job is no picnic and the average tech enthusiast I meet understands less than 10% of what the CEO needs to know or do to run the company. There's actually an extreme shortage of qualified people to run big tech businesses.
[Realistically, what do you think about the so called ""talent shortage""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|There is a shortage of talent in markets that are new and growing fast, and an excess supply of talent for industries that are old and not growing.
[Do you base your analysis purely on public information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Yes, but the amount of information I can put together on company A working full time and utilizing every available public resource is many times greater than what the average armchair quarterback can do at home working a few hours a week. Investing is an incredibly cumulative job, so the longer you do it the more you can see patterns in the data. I spend a lot of my time doing detailed models for every company I invest in, which I think can be a huge competitive advantage. Not just for knowing how a particular trend will impact the business, but also when something is announced or a company upstream/downstream from them says something, I know what it means and how to react. 
[What doing your analysis do you have  bullshit meter for each company your analyze? Which one is the worst offender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Ha great question. I have had to develop an acute bullshit meter over the years. The worst offender is no longer a publicly traded stock.
[Could you be specific as to the markets that are new and growing fast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55glkk?context=5)|Smartphones, wifi, solid-state storage, to name a few.
[Ok, this is sweet. So it sounds like I'm on a good track; I'm starting research today in fact with one of my prof's, and have an internship quasi-lined up for next summer at Apple.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|Minor = doesn't matter. If you need some electives, take accounting and corporate finance. Helps when you transition to the business side of things if you can speak the language.
[Have you noticed a difference between colleagues/friends of yours that chose to go to grad school vs going into industry? Would a minor in anything in particular be useful in retrospect? Also, best and worst part of getting your EE undergrad? What made you go to grad school for your MBA and not EE/Physics/Comp. Sci?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|If you are really brave, take OB.
[What is ""OB""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55eln0?context=5)|Organization Behavior.
 |Aka, how not to look like a complete asshole when you're in a management position.
[How long do you think it will be before RIM is bought out or goes bust? What do you think of the rumour that they will be purchased by Facebook?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ag78?context=5)|RIM is attractive for its net cash position, IP portfolio, and long tail of BBS subscriber revenue. The hardware/phone side is worth nothing. I am surprised it hasn't been acquired yet.
 |Facebook, lol.
[At what point does Steve Balmer get forced to leave Microsoft?  And why has he been able to stay at the head of that company for so long with so few successes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ay05?context=5)|Ballmer should leave today, imo. He is running a terrible farce. Windows8 is awful. And as much as they like to point to the scoreboard (earnings), Microsoft has been awful at seeing and capturing technology changes.
[*Windows8 is awful.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fsmm?context=5)|Fair points.
[Why do you think he is so awful?  I mean not his specific failings, but why he actually has those failings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55mr6l?context=5)|Monopoly power and ridiculous amounts of money flowing in. Perfect combination to give everyone there (especially at the top) all the evidence they need to confirm they are awesome. Even when they suck.
[What did you think of the Skype acquisition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bvq5?context=5)|Waste of money.
[What are your thoughts on MSFT's new Surface tablet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|On your bio, TL;DR sorry. Anyone can make it into a top MBA program. See my other AMA where I answered a lot of questions like this.
[Do you think it'll be a platform that will spur more innovation in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Tech-wise.
[Do you think APPL has now reached the level where MSFT is at in terms of growth and being cash rich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Surface: hate it. But the non-Apple PC community will invest billions developing and marketing Win8 tablets so expect to see a lot more like this and potentially someone will make a winning device. Needs to be cheaper. Hate that WindwsRT comes with office by default. That adds $25-40 to the bill of materials. Makes it impossible to compete w/ ipad on the basis of price.
[Do you believe the tech industry has reached the peak of a bubble with the whole FB valuation fiasco and most of the IPOs current prices below offering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Apple: still a lot of growth potential as they continue to enter new geographic markets. But agree, not a lot of innovation on the near-term horizon.
[What range do you think FB should've been priced at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|The FB IPO was an embarassment, one of the worst processes I've seen, and I have invested in or evaluated hundreds of IPOs. Good companies are reluctant to IPO now due to the FB hangover.
[What are your thoughts on the all startups in Sillcon Valley that are spurring up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|I have no opinion honestly about what people do with companies they start. If cashing out is what you want, then do it. If staying at a company forever because you're passionate, do that. But ffs, don't stay as CEO of a startup if you are holding the company back from reaching the next level. It's not about you anymore once you hire employees.
[How long till they come back down and will they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bixl?context=5)|Now, back in oversupply. I expect prices to move down to normalized levels very quickly.
[Why aren't we seeing more dual mode e-ink / LCD displays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bg9w?context=5)|1) too expensive to combine.
 |2) you can't do e-ink with a touch panel - it response to small voltages and the capacitive touch panel messes up the view.
[What are the main barriers to US based electronics manufacturing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55cgsf?context=5)|A few things make it hard to manufacture electronics in the US  3) Taxes are 30% here vs 0 to 15% in favorable countries. IMO the tax rate on manufacturing in the USA should be 0% since we're currently getting 30% of nothing anyway.
[Thoughts on Amazon's hardware business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bz3a?context=5)|Amazon doesn't have a hardware business for long if all it does is sell crap at a cheap price to hopefully lock you into Prime. If they can make a decent tablet, then it makes a lot of sense to sell that at $0 profit in order to drive more of the core retail business. I'm skeptical because Amazon lacks the R&amp;D capability to move at the industry pace with compelling products. Better to stick with what they're good at.
[What's the future for Microsoft's mobile efforts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bz3a?context=5)|Same opinion for the elusive Facebook phone.

[What country is best poised to take over America as the leading tech innovator?  America seems to be falling behind in education and IMHO it's a matter of time till it falls behind.  Any private dot coms that you think are poised to do big things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bvce?context=5)|I don't think America will lose its spot as the leading tech innovator. Our system of free enterprise and high rewards for the biggest risk takers is unlike any other country on earth. Everyone thinks it's China, but I disagree. Too little respect for IP protection, and frankly too much corruption in the relationship between state and private enterprise. I don't think it's Japan or Europe or any other mature market.  I do agree America is falling behind where it should be in terms of education, but innovation is more about how the system encourages people to take risk by offering a huge potential reward to winners and respecting the rule of law especially around protecting IP.
[How do you see the cable business in the future?  Both the big networks (Comcast, etc..\) and the hardware suppliers like Motorola, Cisco and Broadcom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55d05b?context=5)|IPTV and over the top TV/video will slowly eat away at cable subscriptions, but that doesn't mean the cable co's are dead. Just means they will likely need to change their business model to cafeteria style as opposed to shoving over 9000 channels at you for one high monthly price.

If you're feeling a bit braver, Intel and Microsoft are desperate for talent.

Not enough smartphone units to offset the increasingly high fixed costs of doing business as a global smartphone vendor. That's my opinion. 
[Do  you follow the deemphasis of .NET and managed code by Microsoft?  They are all in on C++, or native code as they call it, for the windows 8 tablets and phones.  Anders Hejlsberg is probably the greatest language designer of all time and has done amazing work on C# and .NET.  Yet in this latest version of Windows with WinRT as the foundation does not advance .NET at all.

 |MSFT had to make some changes with Win8 to make sure all Windows appstore apps will run from a single binary on ARM or x86, but that may or may not be relevant to your .net question.
 |On who is in charge at Microsoft, answer is a few delusional rich guys whose heads are the size of Mars up their Jupiter size asses.
[Why is Bill Gates standing on the sidelines while Microsoft imploads? He would love to have Apple quantities of money if just to bankroll his plans to save the world. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bjfe?context=5)|He and Steve Ballmer don't see it happening that way. They see (a) record earnings, (b) believe Win8 is a panacea for the Microsoft brand moving into phones/tablets while holding lock on PCs, (c) think they are innovative and awesome.  
[The more of your comments I read, the more I wish all business analysis reporting was done in your tone/plain english. It would make it so much more refreshing to read on a daily basis!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ybxm?context=5)|That's because you don't have to be professional or PC on reddit :)
[Why can't anyone do a better job at search than Google? The quality of the search results from google have not improved for the last 10 years. Yet no one else seems to have developed anything better. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55buay?context=5)|There are some potentially better solutions, but proven only on a small scale. Google may improve their search using some of them.
 |Only a few companies on earth have built out the data center capacity to index the web in near real-time, algorithmically search all the data, and give you an answer right away. The tech infrastructure alone is a barrier to anyone who thinks they have a better search.
 |Also, google has improved its results over time by doing stuff in the background to reduce gaming of their algorithm. 
[Lenovo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c2tk?context=5)|Good company with high market share in the only regions of the world where PCs are still growing.
 |I worry about competition from Samsung (they are pushing hard on PCs now) and general slowing in China.
[Any specific Samsung products you think will pose a threat to Lenovo's market share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55d4yo?context=5)|Mainly in notebooks, but Samsung is starting to push very hard both on high-end laptops (ultrabooks), and will see more of this next year around Windows8 with hybrid tablet/clamshell devices and low-end ultrathin laptops that should see prices as low as $350 imo.
 |Samsung is #2 in Brazil (3rd biggest PC market in the world now) and Lenovo is #1. If the battleground for growth is emerging BRIC markets then Samsung and Lenovo are potentially the prize fighters. I'd probably bet on Samsung either (a) winning or (b) losing but not until making life difficult for Lenovo for 2-3 years.
[Wow I need you as a tutor!  I have many many questions. You don't have to answer them all. Thanks!  Can you elaborate more on Samsung vs other companies in different countries on the case of laptops?  What about cellphones? What do you see as Nokia's future?  Is there any chance that Samsung/LG will go bad?  What path should Japan take to take on the global world of cellphones?  Will iPhones stay in Hong Kong/Singapore? (iPhone got a pretty big share\)  Will German tech industries go bad with the EU going bad?  What do you see on EU's future?  If you are familiar with Hynix, how would they perform compared to others?  Which companies are worth a look from the BRICS? G20?  If you are familiar with North Korea's software development, what would you say about their development of Red Star OS?  Which companies are relatively easier to get hired into for their size?  What do you think about Korea and Japan's technological integration into social services; which companies should reap the greatest benefits after FTA's?  What is the future of American car companies? German? French?  On what you mentioned, how will Samsung perform against Lenovo in Brazil in the territory of laptops?  With SSD's on the rise, which companies have positive outlook in that area?  Do you see a future in Google's self-driving cars? How soon/late or why not?  If you are familiar with Rasberry Pi, which companies should/would take the benefits from it if there are any benefits?  With the ever evolving FTA's around the world, which steel company do you think will reign supreme?  Does Chile have any potential in the tech industry in the global market?  What do you think about Sony with their playing level? Do you think they are going to go the right/wrong path?

Too much cyclical and commodity dynamics.
 |ARM is one of the best positioned companies in the tech space and that's why it trades for such a high P/E. I wouldn't make an investment bet based on ARM failing to succeed. The stock itself is another issue and for that I'm gonna avoid giving advice one way or another.
 |Mobile space will be dominated by ARM, plain and simple. Intel might get some wins but I do not expect to see Intel ever get above 10% share in mobile comms.
[Since nobody else has seemed to ask it, and since it's one of my favorite companies, got anything on ASUS? Sorry if I'm late to the party...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55jn93?context=5)|I think Asus is challenged over the long run even though they have a nice notebook business today. Their Ultrabook is good too. I worry mostly that their scale and cost structure are not good enough to sustain profitability as the PC industry consolidates around much bigger companies (HP, Lenovo, eventually Samsung). 
[Wow, thanks for actually getting back to me. I also noticed that nobody asked about Corsair. Got anything there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55mj0b?context=5)|High performance memory. Days are numbered is my opinion. No such thing as sustainable business making a differentiated product in a commodity business. 
[What do you do now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ascn?context=5)|I work for a global hedge fund, focused exclusively on tech hardware stocks.

I was working full time in R&amp;D engineering, got a bunch of my stuff patented and published, so I approached some professors I knew and they said it would make a great PhD.

How is the climate and work environment better/worse/different where you are now compared to engineering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ucs5?context=5)|It varies a lot from fund to fund, both comp and people.
 |Some are full of assholes and don't pay well (common)
 |Some have amazing people and pay very well (rare)
 |And combinations in between.
 |If I had to guess, entry level hedge fund analysts probably make $250k/year in salary + bonus. If you do well and have a share in the carried interest, it can easily be $1M or more. If you do poorly, you make $250k for a year or two and then have to find a new job.

 |Some funds employ generalists who look at everything, everywhere.
 |Some look at specific geographies.
 |Some look at specific sectors... mine happens to be tech hardware.
 |Still others look to invest in anything as long as it fits a certain theme, such as trading two sides of patent litigation outcomes or arbitraging the risk spread on M&amp;A (basically when you buy stock in a company that is being acquired for $XX because it feels like a high probability event and you can earn, say, 6% in 3 months for holding the shares.
[I am an EE an was offered a job in Schrader, which I refused for another job a bit closer to home.  I was recently told that in the UK and possibly many more countries that a law is passing that states all cars have to have a tire pressure monitor fitted (which I believe Schrader dominates the market\).  Did I shit out by passing for a job with a company that (from the sounds of it\) is going to hit the big time?

This is my full time job, I do all my own research, talk with everyone and formulate my own opinions.

 |I also think it's going to be confusing to consumers that some Win8 devices will support your old applications and others won't. Who is going to explain that to your mom when she buys a notebook but can't install her 10-year old printer driver?
 |Surface to me is MSFT's way of saying their OEM partners are taking too long and something needs to be out now to challenge ipad. It's pissed off a lot of OEMs already.
[What about Microsoft and the upcoming Windows 8. Will they be able to gain new market share in tablets and smartphones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55b5lv?context=5)|Win8 sucks.
 |Phones aren't selling and the ones they do sell are currently being so heavily subsidized it makes my eyes bleed.
 |A lot of OEMs will make the tablets and you'll see a lot of push. Ultimately will be more expensive than ipad and that probably won't work.
[After reading most of your answers so far, it sounds like you have a pretty negative view on most hardware manufacturers.

 |Which pony is best? Ask me a name and I'll give my thots. Really trying not to give specific stock advice here.
[With the introduction of Apple's ""Retina Display"" in the new MacBook Pros, it seems inevitable that they eventually feature it in all or most of their products. My question is, why aren't other phone/computer makers attempting to mimic the Retina Display level qualities in their products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55cjgf?context=5)|It is easier for Apple to justify the more expensive screen since they play exclusively in high-end PCs. For a guy like HP selling $500 laptop vs Apple's Macbook Pro in the $1200-2000 range, it makes a big difference in profitability.
 |But yes, everyone is attempting to copy Apple, and most are not doing it successfully.
[When do you think HTML5 will be the standard platform for mobile gaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55byf4?context=5)|Or something like it, browser based, yes. But distribution is still the bigger problem. If you can avoid paying Apple a 30% distribution tax, that's great, but saving 30% of nothing is still nothing.
[Do you have any opinions or general insights on VMware vs Citrix vs *gasp* Microsoft in the world of Virtualization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55b2nc?context=5)|Virtualization still only at 5% penetration last I checked. Plenty of room for the pie to grow and that's good for all these guys. My understanding is VMW has the advantage. MSFT does ok in the channel with low end product.
 |Personally I hate citrix on ipad.
 |But i'm a hardware guy and for hardware virtualization is good for now (driving a server upgrade cycle) but long term will lead to longer hardware upgrade cycles which is bad.
[Also, when are these graphics cards with 1000+  cores going to ""revolutionize"" computing? All I've seen so far is highly advanced science simulations, almost nothing for an end user. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bdjd?context=5)|NVDA is kicking AMD's ass in discrete graphics. And Rory @ AMD doesn't seem to mind focusing away from discrete cards - his attention is focused on what a few OEM customers want. I don't see that changing any time soon.  GPU computing is slowly changing things for high-performance computing. Look at the makeup of the top 10 super computers - roughly half GPUs now.  For every day computing, most software can't take advantage of all those cores.

 |But I do think Intel is a threat to both since over time I think we'll see all graphics except for gaming cards move to integrated on-die with the CPU. That's about 75% of the discrete GPU unit volume that will move away from NVDA over time. AMD is somewhat shielded because they also have integrated GPU and CPU on-die now, and are driving that to become the standard.
[How is Kepler killing it?

 |Marc Benioff is one hell of an arrogant asshole though. But so was Steve Jobs.
[What is the future of making CPUs faster? Adding multiple cores will only give a certain amount of speed increase, even with software optimized for multicore processing. The CPU clock frequency of new processors seems to have peaked at around the ~3ghz mark. Is using optical buses a possible solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55chil?context=5)|Optical serial busses, eventually but it is expensive.
 |I think near-term it will be less about faster CPU cores and more about consolidating system functions on-die to make the overall experience better. At least that is what I see Intel trying to do.
 |Also stacked die and silicon interposers will make things smaller, faster, more battery efficient.

vlofb,3,2012-06-25,Is a Linguistics and CS degree any help?,Mason_son_of_Math,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vlofb/is_a_linguistics_and_cs_degree_any_help/,"Hello, I'm a college student pursing a B.A. in Linguistics and Computer Science. The curriculum includes some introductory programming classes and a few upper division courses, but has about half as many as what the full CS degree requires. However, I will also take a variety of linguistics courses, including one on computational linguistics or natural language processing.

I'm basically wondering if this linguistics will make me a more attractive candidate, or won't help me at all because employers still want to see that I've taken a ton of CS courses. Electives will allow me to take two more upper divs, and I plan to take even more CS if possible.

I want to be a software engineer/programmer because, so far, I've found programming very enjoyable. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a natural but coding makes a lot of sense to me and I haven't had this much fun doing something school-related since I took calculus. I'm wondering if my degree will help me, or if I'll have to work extra hard on my own to catch up to all those programmers with fancy pants Bachelor of Science degrees.

And no, changing majors isn't an option due to a good deal of red-tape bullshit. Otherwise I'd already be a full-on CS major.

Additional wrinkle: I'm in California but would prefer to work in Massachusetts for non-career reasons. Upon a perfunctory glance of internships from major companies, a few seem to have offices in Cambridge and the surrounding area. How decent are my chances of getting work there?"

voazj,0,2012-06-27,What was it about your profession that caused you to know that it was or was not right for you? Advice to those unsure of their future?,PoochieMcPoochmuffin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/voazj/what_was_it_about_your_profession_that_caused_you/,"I'm an undergraduate rising junior with a double major in Art and English at a small, not very well known college. I am very active at school with leadership positions in clubs, I volunteer, and I maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Out of school, I volunteer and am currently involved in two internships. I love literature, art, and communicating with people unlike myself.

I have no idea what I want to do when I leave college. For many years now, my dream was to go into writing/drawing comics and get a MFA at SCAD, but as I'm learning just how difficult it is to even get a job -- let alone a good paying one -- I'm rethinking of if an open door is worth so much debt. Not only that, but I question if I even should follow my dream. So often, I can't even pick up a pencil because all I think is, ""Make something great. If you don't, you're a failure. You'll never make it to SCAD,"" causing me to be constantly blocked by my own insecurities. If I can't do what I want as a career now, how can I expect to do it later?

Worse yet is I'm not only greatly interested in comics, but also the world of journalism and art galleries/museums. I currently work for the newspaper at my school, and I love it. Meanwhile, I volunteer at an art gallery and currently have an internship at another art gallery, and I love that field as well. While I'm actually doing things I love in other disciplines, the one I'm working towards has yet to even become a hobby due to so much fear.

All I ever wonder is what if I make the wrong decision and stick to one path and end up finding out that I'm either not good at it or that it doesn't make me happy? Is an open door worth regret later on? Worth finding out I'm either not good at something or that something doesn't make me happy?

I could just try to bury my fears and give it a shot, but sometimes going for one's dream isn't the right path. Sometimes just doing something isn't enough when it's hasty and immature. Sometimes YOLO is the worst thing to do. And that sometimes is what's causing me to be stuck even while I do my best to go forwards. 

Jumping into one job field and trying to make the transition into a completely different one is not easy in this job market. I could always try to make myself feel better by saying, ""I have time,"" but all I can think instead is, ""What am I working towards?""

My problem is that I'm an outsider when it comes to my dream. I research it, but unlike journalism and the gallery world, I have yet to actually experience the ins and outs of it, the actual industry and what it's like being a part of it. Unfortunately, no comic publishers are near me, and all of the internships provided do not work at all with my school academic calendar, either beginning a month or two too early or a month or two too late. I would really have to jump into the industry blindfolded, and the only way to even jump is with SCAD and the education it provides as well as the great networking.

Okay. Let's say I give up on comics and SCAD. My dream gone, impractical and stupid. Then what? Journalism or the art world? I'm still split on what I should do or be. I keep wondering what will make me happy? What will make me fulfilled? I keep worrying about the thought of 10 years from now waking up and realizing I should have followed one track and not another.

&lt;b&gt;TLDR: College undergrad fearful of future. Fearful of making the wrong choice in career path. Fearful of not being happy and always wondering, ""What if?"" Fearful of growing old filled with regret with a job I'm not good at or grow to hate.

I want to know why you're happy or not happy with your job, what it is about your job that caused you to know it was or was not right for you, if you always wanted to have the job you have now, and any tips for those who are afraid of their future career path.&lt;/b&gt;"

vnuv1,0,2012-06-26,"My girlfriend and I met and married in an MMO 8 Years Ago, help us finally break the distance?",kcm117,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vnuv1/my_girlfriend_and_i_met_and_married_in_an_mmo_8/,"The Story:

Eight years ago at the age of 14 I moved to the Florida from The Bahamas.  I didn’t know a single person so I decided that I would purchase a video game to occupy my time.  I stumbled into Best Buy and wandered into the video games section.  As I gazed at my choices, Star Wars Galaxies caught my eye.  I had never played an MMO before and I loved Star Wars, so it seemed like a good fit.

I spent my noob days wandering around Tatooine on the Ahazi server, until finally one day in Bestine, someone was advertising/recruiting for a guild called -CoP-.  I joined the guild and met a bunch of very nice people, whom i played with for over a year.  I grew very close to one person in particular, a female guildmate that played along with her brother and father.  We ended up getting married in the game after a few months.

After spending so much time talking in the game, we began to talk on Teamspeak and Ventrilo.  She seemed like a really nice girl and we became friends.  At this point, we were not more than online friends due to the fact that she lived in Indiana and I was in Florida, over 1,000 miles away.  After SWG started to fade, we still kept in touch through email and social networking.  I’d regularly contact her to see how she was doing and to make sure all was well.  After a few years, Star Wars: The Old Republic was announced.  We agreed that we would play on the same server and relive old times.

Fast forward to December of 2011, 7 years later and we were back online in a Star Wars setting.  Both older and more mature, we talked constantly via voice chat and began to realize the characteristics in one another that made us come together initially.  I was coming up on my last semester of University after five long years (dual major), and would finally be able to move wherever I wanted.  The timing seemed right so after a month of catching up, we decided to start a long-distance relationship.

I flew up to Indiana after a month and a half to finally meet the girl whom I had known for seven long years.  We had an instant deep connection that I had never felt with any of the other girls that I had previously dated, this was special.  My family initially thought I was crazy for flying across the country to meet “some girl from the internet”, and that I was most certainly going to be murdered by strangers. But alas, everything went well and her family really liked me.  This may seem naive or cliche, but we both knew we had each found our soul mate in one another.

We’ve been flying back and forth over the last few months visiting one another when work and school schedules permitted.  Towards the end of the semester I started applying to jobs in Indiana to discover that even for a graduate with three internships, work experience and two degrees, finding a post-graduation job is difficult.  I’ve applied to damn well over fifty positions with nothing yielding positive results as of yet.  There is added difficulty in applying for jobs in a city that is a thousand miles away.

I thought I would share this story to reddit for a number of reasons.  To show the fact that love can be found on the internet, that MMO’s may not be a complete waste of time and to ask for the Reddit community’s help and advice.  

Does the community have advice, comments, or job leads for someone in my shoes?  For background info, my degrees were in Finance &amp; Management Information Systems.  I also have internship experience in IT asset management, wealth management and internet product management.  I’m a very quick learner, dedicated individual and overall nice guy.  Also, I’m a redditor just like you. I’ve applied to a very high number of jobs and always attempt to follow up, but it’s difficult out there for new graduates as i’m sure many of you know.
 
We could really use help breaking the distance and finally being together, any advice?

I need your help.  I'm a guy, in my early 20s, and just graduated from one of the better universities in central London, UK.  I've now been offered an internship in the tech sector for the next 2-3 months.  It's unpaid, but they've hinted I might be offered a position at the end.
That's got me thinking - what should I expect salary wise, and do I negotiate?
I like to think I'm a pretty valuable commodity.  I've graduated from a good university, in a good, serious topic, with a 2.1 (that's a 3.0 GPA for Americans, ish).  I've got a lot of real work experience in a variety of sectors.  But I'm a recent graduate, and this is in a competitive field I'm really interested in working in.  I've also got parents who live nearby, and live there, so a huge starting salary isn't essential - but what should I be expecting?  What should I settle for?

I've asked my parents, but they both work in banks, so I'm not sure how valuable their advice is.  My dad said take anything, then try and make yourself invaluable, but my mum pointed out quick promotion isn't guaranteed in technology fields, especially in a customer service/operations position, so don't settle for anything under 25k.

So, reddit, what do you think?
**tldr: early 20s recent graduate, with a good degree, 2.1, in central London.  Want to know what salary I should settle for in an entry level customer service technology position, and whether/how you negotiate/discuss these things.**"
vqr1v,0,2012-06-28,Looking for GA Tech student with sufficient IT/system admin knowledge to do contract work with small law firm,Morningside,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/vqr1v/looking_for_ga_tech_student_with_sufficient/,"I am looking for someone with sufficient IT/computer system/admin knowledge that can be available for various IT related issues that arise in our small law firm.  I'm posting on r/gatech since I assume many of you have this knowledge base, and as a former college student, know that each of you like making good money.

I do not believe that any issues that arise here are too complicated for someone with sufficient knowledge of these things. For example, we have 4 copiers/printers/scanners in the office, and I cannot get them mapped to the network so that items scanned can be emailed or saved directly to the network. I have worked on it for a few days, but I believe I have reached the end of my knowledge and I need to hire someone that has a greater understanding of these matters to handle these things in the future. 

I really believe that a junior or senior in college in a related field would be able to handle this job without a problem. If I'm correct then this person could make some good money over the next year (or longer) by doing contract work for us. Additionally, I would be interested in discussing any other set up to assist, such as either part-time employment or a paid internship (with the understanding that it is not really an internship since you won't have a mentor).

If you believe you have what it takes to help us out, please email me your resume and/or other information to AtlantaLawFirmNeedsITPerson@gmail.com. Depending on the number and quality of the submissions I will be in contact to discuss a meeting time.

Thanks.  


EDIT:  To all you naysayers out there, this is a real law firm that needs some IT help.  I chose Reddit because I tend to find quality people on this site, both professionally and socially.  I also find a lot of people like some of the posters below who would not believe the sky was blue unless they saw it with their own eyes and had the Pope swear by affidavit by it. 

Additionally, you can see from my user account that I'm not some bot using reddit for nefarious reasons.  I'm always reading, and I regularly contribute. 

As for the sketchy email address, that was so I don't get bombarded with resumes and emails on my work account.  Responses are coming from my work eamil address so you can do your due diligence and realize that this is an actual law firm in a real building and with actual employees.  Is it so crazy to not want to put my work email out there for solicitations?  Apparently some of you think that way.    

So for those that took a wild leap of faith by emailing your resume to someone who is offering work, thank you.  For those of you who doubt the world is round because you've never personally seen it from space, good luck to you.  



UPDATE:  I brought in someone from GT who is working out well so far.  I have disabled the gmail email address listed above.  Thanks to each and every one of you that submitted your resume.  "

To begin, I'm a rising sophomore in college who's set on finding an internship for the next summer no matter what. I'm ready to do pretty much anything: learn a new language, a new concept, you name it.    
The thing with me is that I actually did't understand/hated programming before January of this year (talk about a bad high school experience).     
So far I have taken an introductory course to Java; will be taking a continuation to that one in the fall (basically: algorithms and data structures), also will take discrete mathematics at the same time.     
This past semester really made me like CS and I'd like to pursue the degree. I understand that in order to set up myself for a better job after college, I need experience, lots of experience. So one of my ultimate goals for this upcoming academic year is to learn as much as possible for the recruitment season (which usually starts in January/February in my university).   
**TL;DR**    
**My experience so far**: basic Java, some Android development (started teaching myself this summer), HTML (lol), and some XML.     
**What are the ""must-haves"" that I need to learn before January 2013?**     
P.S. also, for anyone in a similar situation, I found these threads particularly **helpful**: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rghrs/can_you_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_in/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/h6cfk/computer_science_internships_how_do_i_go_about/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m5biu/a_question_regarding_cs_internship_resumes/)"
vpsau,0,2012-06-27,"Got a traffic ticket for supposedly not stopping at a stop sign and mild speeding, is this worth fighting? Anyone have any advice/good stories about pleading not guilty and going to court?",ChazzyCheese,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vpsau/got_a_traffic_ticket_for_supposedly_not_stopping/,"I was pulling out of a parking lot after buying a delicious sandwich and on the way out I accelerated a bit too much and I guess there was a cop around, because I got pulled over almost immediately after I turned right at the corner.

Well I got the feeling that the cop who pulled me over was power trippin'  pretty much the first thing she said was ""You're gonna be leaving here with at least a $500 ticket you know that?"", which is quite funny because even after writing me all that she could it only was $318. Anyway, she goes on to tell me how I was speeding and going 45 in a 25. Whatever, I acknowledge this and admit my fault but then she says I did not stop at the stop sign, which is ridiculous because I stopped for at least 3 seconds (which is the minimum at least in my home state), to which she replied that I was over the stop line..

Now wait a minute. The intersection where this particular stop sign is is a pretty big intersection, meaning that if you actually wanted to see if there were any cars coming, you would have to go a little further ahead to safely view the road. That is what I did, I actually might have even stopped fully before and inched up until I could see so I was pretty pissed that my ticket included that, so I plead not guilty cause fuck that shit, y'know?

Well fast forward a bit, my court date is here but I'm currently not in the same state (2.5 hrs away, got the ticket while at university) and am doing a 9-5 internship everyday of the week, so I can't really go attend my court date. So I'm thinking of just calling the court and changing my plea to guilty and just pay my fine and get it over with. I could however ask them if they could delay the date, as I will be back at school only 3 weeks after when my date is scheduled.

So do you think I should just pay the fine or try to get them to postpone my court date and still go try to fight it?


TLDR: Got traffic ticket, should I pay fine or plead not guilty"

[Is r/squaredcircle one of the sites you visit for consumer research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do visit r/squaredcircle, but that's just because I'm a redditor lol. I have no idea of any plans to change the set or theme but there is a chance everything will change on the 1000th episode. Also, its going to be highly interactive. Like taboo tuesday but better.
[Any word if there are plans to change the raw set or theme anytime soon? For the 1000th episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do work in stamford in the Titan Towers building. I didn't see Morgan.
[I'm assuming you work in the Titan towering Stamford, correct? Did you see Matt Morgan there last week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I talk about everything wrestling with my boss, including TNA and ROH and UFC. It's my job to know about them and talk about them =)
[Do they openly talk about TNA around the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I went to an ROH event this past weekend.
[Any insight as to why WWE seems to have a hardon for twitter?  Notice any changes in policy or marketing relating to Linda's campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|WWE is proud of its social media presence. social media is essentially free marketing so it would be foolish not to integrate.  I haven't noticed anything due to Lina's campaign. I will say that Fox News is always on the tvs in the elevator lol. I trained for a year with the IWF in NJ. They aren't around anymore but I had some of the best times of my life there.
[To what extent was your Indy career? Where'd you train/wrestle? How was WWE's attitude towards this in the interview process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|The interview process was very relaxed. They didn't ask me any ""interview questions"" such as what is your greatest flaw etc. They just wanted to know my availability, knowledge of the product, and what days I could work. The second they asked me how much I knew about the product, I knew I was in.
[Coolest wrestler you've met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568rkw?context=5)|Well I've only been here since June 4th and haven't seen many wrestlers. Also, I only work Mon-Wed. But Paul Levesque comes in on Wednesdays and I've actually met him. We are on a first name basis (I call him Paul) which is such insanity. For those who don't know Paul is better known for his in ring persona, Triple H.
[I am correct to assume he's a massive individual in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b897?context=5)|Yes, even in a suit. Although I'm 6'3"" so it wasnt that bad. I was mostly just shitting myself and trying not to pull an awkward penguin while shaking his hand.
[Is he still married to Stephanie?  (Vince's daughter\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56efsh?context=5)|Yup.
[Do people actually think its real? Any funny stories in regards to that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568t26?context=5)|I figured this would come up. First of all, most people know its scripted.  It isn't fake though. I would never call it that. Everything they do in there from an athletic point of view is completely real. They put on a show at any costs. The pain and excitement is very real. Obviously the punches are pulled and they are mostly all friends who don't want to hurt themselves. Why would they? If they actually killed each other every night there would be noone left to fight after a month.
 |I will say that the kids do have a higher suspension of disbelief. On my first day I checked my messages on my phone because I was getting used to my office and I saw that I had a voice-mail. It was from a very young kid who must have found our number online and called and somehow it got transferred to my desk. I listened to the voice-mail and it was hilarious and cute. The kid was so upset with The Big Show and was telling me how WWE NEEDS to fire him. The message went on for 5 minutes. I still might have it. He kept saying how Big Show is bad for business and needs to be fired for what he has done.
 |Big Show is one of the WWE's top heels right now and this voice-mail just reminded me of the passion I used to have for this program when I was 11.  I still have passion for the product, but I'm much more grown up now lol.

Like a special big-boy toilet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c776?context=5)|He has his own bus, so it's possible.
[Are you ever tempted to get fired just hear Vince McMahon fire you?  Is that why you created this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569uej?context=5)|2) I don't think I will get fired for this. (At least I really really hope I dont) 1) My career goals thus far are to join the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" and hear Vince yell those two infamous words ;)
[ now reddit knows you want to kiss an old mans ass...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56anbb?context=5)|YES! YES! YES!
[How long have you been there? Have you met all the wrestlers? and what is Vince like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568slx?context=5)|The wrestlers are usually on the road and don't often come to my building. I haven't met Vince, so I cant tell you, but Paul was very nice. Joey Styles also introduced himself to me. I call him Joe.
 |I started on June 4th. Everyone that I have met is so incredibly nice. It is seriously the best working environment I could think of. Especially since I've been a hardcore fan since middle school.
[So what exactly is your daily job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568ray?context=5)|Basically, I am the eyes and ears of the WWE on dirt-sheets and competitive analysis. I go through the internet and find out what people are saying about WWE, its programs, and its upcoming network. I also keep an eye on UFC, TNA, and boxing updates. I look at what other companies are doing marketing wise, and think of how WWE could put their own spin on it. I maintain a PPV Competitive Calendar that compares buyrates in our industry. My current big project is creating a database that contains information on EVERY WWE PPV EVERRRR!! It's taking a while, but is an important task. My work is going to be shown to the VP of something or other, so I'm proud of that.

[What kind of information about the PPVs are you collecting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bjh9?context=5)|Buyrates mostly. Fan reactions. Looking for any changes in our competition (injuries, contract disputes, conficting PPV dates)
[Always wondered if they look into things like what people are saying. Does that influence things, and how so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568wfw?context=5)|It doesn't influence things too much. Obviously I see the feedback on the dirt sheets and a lot of it is negative, but I'm used to that. Basically I'm just looking to see what our competators are doing. Recently UFC got like 3 major injuries and had to change a few of its PPV cards. Those are the things I'm looking at.
[Are you getting paid for this internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bd6m?context=5)|Nay, tis for credit.
[ was that true? I was at the Rumble, everyone was pretty much convinced Jericho was going to win, then when Sheamus won the building kinda went... ""huh"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56doqw?context=5)|It would seem to be true, although I cant confirm that.
[For the fan reactions and competition info are you having to comb the web for this info, or do they already have a lot of it and you're just putting it into a centralized location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bq8w?context=5)|Anything I deem reportable goes to my boss and he does with it what he wants.
[Whoa whoa whoa....you consider the UFC to be a competitor of the WWE?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d9gw?context=5)|Absolutely.
[Were you a big fan before taking the internship? What do you study that landed you there? What was the selection process like? Did working there change what you feel about the WWE? Is it still exciting to watch if you know the outcomes of the matches in advance?  What size are the Great Khali's pants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568v99?context=5)|I have been watching WWE since 2003. It's been an obsession of mine. I study Marketing and this is a marketing internship. I applied online via the corporate site and got a call from an HR person telling me they wanted to interview me. After the interview I was exteded an invite for the Summer internship and had to sign a bunch of papers and stuff.  I don't know details like the outcomes of the matches (I dont want to know frankly) but rather more general things such as which legend will be on RAW this week, who is headlining what PPV, celebrity guests, WWE Magazine stories and WWE.com articles.
[Do you live in the Stamford area or did you have to relocate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ay0p?context=5)|Right now I live on campus at my college in the Bronx/Riverdale area. I commute. Usually a 35-40 minute commute as long as its not raining.
[God, that sounds exciting. I'm from Queens so if I got this my commute would probably be significantly longer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b6fo?context=5)|Plus I work 10-4 so I miss most of rush hour.

[I'm guessing you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bajp?context=5)|Yes! WWE has a parking garage as a part of its corporate headquarters.
[As a CompSec Systems student, you've given me hope and direction. I'm going to try and do all it takes to get that internship next semester. I WANT to work for WWE's IT eventually. It'd be my dream job. Thank you, you've inspired me so much. You have no idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bc5f?context=5)|It really can happen to anyone. I'm just a guy who loves the product and applied for my dream job. Now I have it and will hopefully slowly climb the corporate ladder until I die. Our IT department has some really cool shit and is located on the third floor. Anyone who is interested should call in and see if they can get a tour, or apply for a job/internship online. If you need any help with the application process or have any specific questions about my process I would be glad to help.
[Who is your favorite wrestler currently on the roster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a633?context=5)|Damien Sandow. Without a doubt. My favorite (until his recent semi-retirement) has always been Undertaker. Im also a huge fan of Punk and Bryan and Ziggler. 
[We had a conversation n the pub last week about what matches wedlike to see above all others. The other guys all mentioned triple-threats/Cage matches with Cena, Punk etc..  I just said Ryback v Sandow. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dnh0?context=5)|Maybe when they decide to put Ryback against an actual person that can happen. I doubt it though as they are both getting pushed and for one to put the over now wouldn't be wise. 
[Yeah! I should be moving to Vienna, Austria pretty soon and hopefully pick it up from there!  Any advice you'd like to throw my way? haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cyql?context=5)|I'm sure there are good schools in Europe. Although, honestly, I have no idea where or how to get to them. If you are serious about being a wrestler, do what the greats have done. Get in shape, spend as much time as you can in the ring. Wrestle often. Work on mic skills. Learn from everyone and everything. Always ask veterans for advise. Always improve. Don't stand still. Learn as many styles as you can, luchador, Japanese, American, European. There is so much to learn, you will never stop. Take care of yourself and the people you work with.

I walk past Andre's boots everytime I go to lunch. Every employee has acess to that week's shows and the most recent PPV. WWE programming is constantly on in the cafeteria and elevators. I met Triple H.
[Awesome! I would love to visit that place one day. I am a stock holder so.. GET BACK TO WORK YOU BUM!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cv1t?context=5)|I'm so sorry to hear that. lol.

It has a very WWE ""feel"" to it. The first time I walked into the building, my jaw dropped. I still cant help but smile when I'm walking through the halls. Im such a wrestling nerd and this is pretty much my dream come true.
 |Actually, I think its worth noting that employees have access to the roof and on thursdays there are BBQs =) The view from the roof is beautiful.  Its something I didn't know until I came here.

I'm trying to figure out where I feel like going today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a0he?context=5)|As much as I hate to say it, I have no idea and usually eat in the cafeteria (yuck). Or I bring my own lunch. Sodexo did the food at my college but they got replaced. Just when I thought I'd never have to deal with them again, I come here lol.
[The dirt-sheets have consistently said that Vince changes his mind literally as the wind blows. In the short time you've been there, have you experienced this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569src?context=5)|Yes. That is the feeling I have gotten from the few meetings I've been to. I never have meetings with Vince, but the way others talk about him it seems like he changes his mind a lot. The thing is, I honestly think he is a genius for everything he has created. Geniuses are usually eccentric. Mr. McMahon is no exception. 
[The IWC is enamored with Dean Ambrose...whats his buzz like in the Titan Towers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c1n1?context=5)|It's just awesome. Everyone's hard at work and very excited. We are approaching a huge milestone with this 1000th Raw. You didn't hear it from me, but there is going to be an awesome promo spot for the new start time.
[A promo regarding Dean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c3sk?context=5)|No, I really cant tell you who. but it will be gold.
[Awesome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56desm?context=5)|Ah I read it wrong. I read ""whats the buzz like"". The people I work around love him also. We also like the Prime Time Players. Darren Young got his start at the wrestling camp that I trained at, so Im always pushing for him.
[No one can convince me that goldberg isnt involved now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckes?context=5)|Im sorry to hear that lol.
[The IWC will just be hoping it's Dean from this comment and then be disappointed. It will be all your fault :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cqpt?context=5)|Its actually not.
[Goldust vs cody?!?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56drc6?context=5)|Goldust has been future endeavored.
[Was there any proper reason why the Bella's were fired? Man, I liked those girls :3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56brl6?context=5)|They weren't fired. They just didn't resign.
[Is there any big angle/story/debut that you know about but you can't tell us? Nothing specific really. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b7j0?context=5)|Well it's one that you could all guess but hasn't been confirmed on television. I saw the promo for Summerslam last week. It is centered around Triple H's opponent. (Whoever that may be ;)  ) I knew about the new show Main Event before it was announced as well. I'm not sure about any debuts or anything but I will say that EVERYTHING will change with the 1000th RAW. It's not going to be just a 1 off show with everything going back to normal after. This show is going to change the future of MNR forever.
[RE: Main Event - Is it Superstars with a new name or will it actually have storylines and some of the bigger names in the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c4ml?context=5)|I guess we'll just have to wait and see. That depends on what the higher ups want.
[I've been a longtime subscriber to Meltzer and Alvarez's Wrestling Observer/Figure Four website, and it's amazing to hear that your job (from a marketing standpoint\) is to keep tabs on dirtsheets, especially considering the tenuious relationship wrestling journalists have had with the industry (stating they were false, lying, changing finishes based on what the smart crowd is expecting them to do, etc\).  From your position in the company, both your boss and your co-workers, what is your opinion on the dirtsheets/wrestling journalists? Do they help the product? Hurt the product? A necessary evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c88z?context=5)|I use them as a tool. They tell me all the news I need to know about the industry in one place. I could care less about the drama stories (from a work point of view) but the actual substancial news I use. I am personally a fan of the sheets and journalists. I love the bleacher report. Any buzz about the product is good buzz and I dont think they have the power to do any harm.
[Are you there to make a career out of it, or is it just a part-time temporary gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c5690ad?context=5)|Right now its part-time. My career goal for my life was to get a bunch of jobs and hopefully work for WWE in some respect. Instead, I am still in college and am starting my career here. I am working with people who were interns here and it led to a full time job. Basically, my goal is to hopefully be hired here full time and never ever leave haha.
[Honestly, does wwe creative steal ideas from r/squared circle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56axtd?context=5)|Not that I know of =(
[Now, I'm not going to say the WWE is finding ideas on SquaredCircle, but I am going to point out this comment I made 22 days ago, and well....I think you can see where I'm going with this.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e975?context=5)|Holy Crap! Well done! haha.
[What is your intern position title? what are you going to school for? any special qualifications or ppl you know that got you the job? Does WWE worry about the popularity of UFC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569sgx?context=5)|I am an intern for Affiliate Marketing. I got to a college in the bronx for marketing. I didn't know anybody here when I applied, and this is the only place I applied to. I'm just really really lucky. Also, I go to a fairly reputable school and have a lot of knowledge of the product, which the interviewers loved. Of the 20+ interns I met during orientation, only about 2 of them knew anything about our product, which was very strange to me.
[I'm fairly certain I know who this is from reading this AMA. We go to the same school and worked together on a certain Marketing Presentation for a Korean professor this past semester? Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56akja?context=5)|The dongster!
[What does WWE mainly look for in it's talent? For example if I wanted to get into WWE developmental what would I need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dycd?context=5)|To be a WWE talent you need years of experience, preferably with styles from all around the world. Watch the legends. Use what they did to perfect your skills set. Be willing and humble. After years of training you can pay for a try out at FCW the WWE's developmental territory. I believe they are 1K a try out. Good luck! PS Vince is looking for 6'2 240pounders more or less.
[Looks like I'll just have to train for a long ass time and hopefully not be awful. I'm currently 6'3 and about 175-180lbs with 15% BF at 17 years old, looks like I've still got some work to put in.  I would have thought they would just be looking for great technical wrestlers and mic workers, seen as Punk and Bryan are so over. But I guess they need a nice spread of different builds and styles.  Any idea how much they value technical skill and charisma/mic work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56eifo?context=5)|Technical skill and charisma and mic work are all soooo important. Mic work and charisma are the most important, but will get you only so far. Technical skill is important but unfortuantly not as valued as it should be (look at hogan, cena, miz). If you have technical skill and charisma/mic skills you should be set but McMahon is looking for someone with the skills of punk and bryan but with more muscle. He thinks the reason they aren't as over as they can be is because they dont have the ""superstar"" look. Its bullshit, but its what he thinks.
[What has been the response to the leaked pictures of the new WWE championship belt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569usr?context=5)|My boss and I don't like it (the pics we saw). But I'm not sure if its the real thing or if it was completed or anything like that.
[It's real. The picture was prior to it being finished.  Seems like there is a disconnect here. I was more interested in knowing how they felt internally about it being leaked, not if people ""liked"" it necessarily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1uy?context=5)|Ah, sorry about that. I haven't heard anything either way about the issue, so I just told you what I know. I brought it up in a meeting with my boss and he just sort of acknowledged it and we talked about how we didn't really like it.
[Biggest dick you've met backstage?  Literally and figuratively ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569106?context=5)|A few of the cafeteria workers are assholes. That's it. Everyone else is very nice and made me feel at home.
[Can you explain to me why or how CM Punk is so popular? Also, what the hell was the WWE thinking in bringing back Albert as (Lord\) Tensai?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cbnl?context=5)|Punk is popular with fans old and new. He is fairly unique in that aspect. He entertains kids, and makes wrestling fans happy. Good on him.
 |As for Tensai. I was excited when I saw his promo videos. It was a cool idea that just didn't go over. It happens. I was just talking to my friends about how if they just brought him back as A-Train again, the fans would have accepted him as a wrecking ball and he's be main eventing PPVs. His debut was underwhelming.
[Why is the photo cropped so weird?  What is the little black divot to the right of the squared section at the bottom?  It looks like a short row of pixels have been coloured black.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cig5?context=5)|The answer to all of these is that the photo was taken with my iphone. I dont know what black dovot you are referring to.
[You said you can shred some light on the 1000th Raw and Summerslam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a2si?context=5)|2) Things are SO crazy here because of SummerSlam AND the 1000th Raw. They are both being treated as huge events and everyone is working hard to make them amazing. 
[2\) This doesn't have to do with either shows, but have you noticed an increased workload/more frenzied pace at Titan Towers with the 3 Hour Raws coming up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a2si?context=5)|1) I haven't heard anything yet but I will let you know if I do (as long as I'm allowed to share) I will say that it will be highly interactive with the fans making decisions that will ACTUALLY impact the show. This is what we've been wanting forever right?
[I think many people are skeptical about WWE being interactive because of speculation that they doctor the polls. can you speak to this at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bm0d?context=5)|If that happened in the past, it wont happen with this. With the voting PPVs, creative always had the final say. With this, I am told the WWE Universe will directly effect the outcome. There will be polls and whatever you vote on WILL effect the show.
[Fan from the west coast here:  I know RAW tapes live on the east coast.  Is there any way that they can sometimes make is so that it airs live on both coasts for the shows that are interactive?  It kinda sucks because the voting for interactive shows are over whenever I watch the show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dg0f?context=5)|I have no idea. These are kinks that will have to be worked out when the show debuts.
[I first saw you post on Cenas make a wish thread.  Another Fan mentioned his brother in law having an illness and a huge fan of Cena. He stated his brother keeps himself positive through Cenas mottos.  Is there any way or channels we can get this guy to meet Cena?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dshb?context=5)|I will talk to my boss today and see what he says. It's possible all of that stuff is done through Make A Wish, but I will see.
[If you look at what the internet is saying, make sure to check the Best and Worst of Raw out. One of my favourite reads.  Link to withleather.uproxx.com.  Do you have to be an insider or have certain connections to work with the WWE? You said yourself you trained to be a superstar, so did that help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56chix?context=5)|No, not at all. I did not mention my training in my interview. As with any job, knowing people obviously will help. But I didn't know anybody nor pull any strings. I simply applied and here I am =)
[Do WWE track your calls and monitor your browsing?  Does Vince really like those steak sandwiches smothered in ketchup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cn2h?context=5)|I dont know. To all of those questions lol.
[So from a marketing perspective is there any reason why UFC has been successfully running pay-per-views in Canada, but WWE has barely been coming up here at all recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cql8?context=5)|I have no idea why we dont do more international shows. An educated guess would be that most of our fans are in the US and it is cheaper to do shows here. The UFC is doing a great job expanding world wide. I love watching the company grow. 
[God... are you gonna lose your job over this?  Anyway, uhm....  New WWE title belt coming?  How'd you get the job/what did you major in?  Is it more stressful then you'd ever imagined?  Does WWE pay any attention to the internet?  Have you checked out /r/squaredcircle ?  You might get a kick out of it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d4ol?context=5)|I answered all of these except for one. This job is not stressful. It is everything I have ever wanted. The office is laid back and business casual. Everyone seems friendly and respectful. 
[Ever seen Vince at his nuttiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckwj?context=5)|I've never seen him. Or Steph for that matter, and I'm by her office quite often.
[Does the WWE do drug testing and is drug abuse a problem? Medicals, amphetamines, steroids etc.  If not, do you think many wrestlers take pills etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d4n7?context=5)|WWE has an extensive Wellness Policy. For more information, check the website.
[Any progress on WWE Network plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cwnd?context=5)|There are 4 business models being considered. With Summerslam and Raw 1000 and WWE Network everything is kind of busy and stressful around here. WWE Network plans are hush hush which actually sucks if you are an affiliate marketer because when the affiliate companies ask us for a PPV line up for next year, we don't have them as soon as we typically do.
[How did u apply for your job mate?   and do you know if wwe gives any internships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ayos?context=5)|I've answered this a few times but the availability of jobs and internships is constantly in flux, keep checking the wwe's corporate website for jobs that you could apply for. They have many offices across the world. [Link to corporate.wwe.com](http://corporate.wwe.com/careers/index.js) Cheers!
[How did you get this job? What did you do to apply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569vs8?context=5)|I applied on the corporate website.
[What were the requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a06k?context=5)|I had to be a Junior in College and it had to be for credit. And I had to be a marketing major, but that was because of the specific internship. Anyone who is interested should constantly look at the corporate site for job or internship info. With the development of the WWE network, they are probably going to be hiring a few hundred more people.
[Ever heard Joey Styles screaming OH MY GOD!!! ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dh6y?context=5)|No, but he works near me.

I love them.
[I have been wondering if the set design is done internally or by an outside company for a while.  If it's done internally how do they draft it?  Is it a lot of drawing, 3D modeling, clay structures, 3D printing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56atdt?context=5)|Sorry, but I have no idea. I am but a lowly marketing intern lol.
[No worries!  I'll substitute that question with another then.  What is Brock Lesnar's actual employment status, as well as Paul Heyman?  Will Heyman be a guest manager over the next few weeks at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b4cu?context=5)|Lesnar is contracted. He works a limited number of dates though, so Paul Heyman will be (and has been) taking his place in promos. Which I love. Look for Brock to be on the 1000th show and Summerslam.
[Are there any career opportunities available to you post-internship? when do you finish school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bqnp?context=5)|I have 2 (possibly 1) semester(s) left of school. Then, who knows. If they like me hopefully I get offered a job.
[Will they send you to any of the shows, especially Summerslam or the 1000th Raw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dmhh?context=5)|They are sending people, but not me. Im just an intern. But if I get a job here its possible. Employees can get ticket comps and discounts on merchandise.
[What's a way to get the attention of WWE creative?  I've been trying to get them to notice me and hire me as an Writers Assistant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56acbg?context=5)|Have a good portfolio and apply for a job!

[Ok, cool. I'll try and get my foot in the door. Now by ""for credit"" that means unpaid, just for credit? Because as much as I'd love to do this I don't know how I'd sustain a living there when I'd have to pay for a place to stay for the internship, afford food and such, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e58t?context=5)|Unpaid. Its for credit at my college. 
[Are there any particular wrestling sites that tend to get covered or read more than others?  (Like one site is considered more legitimate than another.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a5kj?context=5)|I basically just look at 3 or 4 sites a day. A lot of them repeat. I like lordsofpain but I cant comment on any site's legitimacy.

I know the answer to this question is to build a pc, however, we are in college and due to the shitty job market, he had to take an unpaid internship. (brilliant guy who is working for a subsidiary for the CDC)  Therefore building a brand new pc is out of the question even with me offering to donate pretty much everything other than mobo and cpu for him.

So basically he wants to just be able to run this game at low settings. He doesn't care if it looks pretty, he just wants to be able to run it. In his system settings he told me that it says that he is running ""Intel HD"" graphics. I'm assuming that means the GMA HD Graphics. He wants this to be as cheap as possible because he is already kind of cringing at the cost of the game itself.

I tried to upgrade the desktop that he has at his mom's place and got him a 520 gt but his motherboard wouldn't support it. He is only there for another month and he can't take the desktop with him back to college, so I am trying to figure out a way that he can play this game on his laptop so he can play this game for more than a month. Any advice for my friend here? Thanks!"
vt0bt,6,2012-06-29,Keeping outdated projects in a portfolio?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vt0bt/keeping_outdated_projects_in_a_portfolio/,"I'm a CS student starting my senior year this fall. I got into webdev a little over a year ago. My school sticks to traditional CS topics and doesn't really have anything specifically focused on web development, so I've been largely self-taught. I've completed a few projects, which I've added to a psuedo-portfolio that I can show employers. 


Since starting my internship doing PHP development this summer, I've been learning a lot more about good practices, design patterns, frameworks, etc. In short - how to actually code decently well, which is something my independent projects are definitely lacking.


So should I go for quality or quantity in my portfolio projects? My options at this point are basically:

-Update what I have, which would be take basically a full (albiet faster with a framework) rewrite of several projects.

-Cut the shitty projects from my portfolio entirely, leaving me with a distressingly low number of remaining ones.

-Keep the shitty projects as they are, at least giving me some content, and ideally illustrating a progression of what I've learned.


Any advice?

Along with supporting all of our remote users (we had properties all over the country) we supported the ones in the home office as well.

Once day a ticket comes through from the Tier 1 group. Someone has spilled a drink on their keyboard, and now the computer won't turn on. I figure it's just a keyboard issue, so I grab a spare and head up to her desk.

I get up there, and she actually did a pretty decent job cleaning up the mess. I swapped out the keyboard, went to turn on the system, and nothing happened. No monitor, no tower, no nothing. I'm now curious, as she didn't spill anything on the tower or monitor.

I start checking all the connections, and everything's fine, but the system won't even power on. I had one of the other tech's bring up a replacement tower and monitor to see if I had missed something. We plugged it in to the power strip, tried to power it on, and nothing happened.

I end up crawling under the desk to see if we had missed something. Suddenly, the answer was as clear as day.

In her haste to keep her computer from being damaged after her drink spill, this lady had unplugged the power strip. Then, once she cleaned up, she plugged it back in. To itself.

I quickly deduced that this was probably the issue, plugged the power strip back into the wall, and magically everything booted just fine.

Sometimes, it's easy to get lost in obvious details and forget that the little things can be just as bad."

So here is my story/background.

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes. 

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there. 

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity.

[How can I stop these calls from your campaign? Do you support and personally approve of robo calling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cbp9?context=5)|I know the calls can sometimes be annoying, and I know it's a lot of hard work for us making the calls, but we're competing with a very well funded incumbent and we have to do everything we can. I hate this system, and that is why I support publicly funded elections through constitutional amendment, but until then, we have to keep fighting.
[Related: Link to www.reddit.com ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cbp9?context=5)|I promise I'll have my staff reevaluate our opt-out process. I apologize for the inconvenience. I sincerely appreciate your generosity and support. 
[Mr. Zerban, your opponent has gotten a lot of attention for his budget plans for the country.  Where do you agree or disagree with him and why?  If you got to introduce your own budget, what would you focus on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c4ty?context=5)|First, I think I should point out that the Ryan Budget, is really more of an ideological document than it is a budget. It lacks numbers. Makes assumptions. Very few details.
 |I oppose turning Medicare into a voucher program. I oppose tax credits for already profitable oil corporations. I oppose extension of the Bush tax cuts. I oppose the privatization of Social Security. I oppose cutting Pell Grants.
 |I grew up in a single parent home where my mother struggled to make ends meet. I ate government cheese at home and free lunch and milk at school. I was only able to get a higher education with the help of Pell Grants and Stafford Loans. Because my government made a small investment in me, I was able to go on to start two small businesses and employ 45 people (who earned living wages and health benefits). Without my country making a small investment in me, I wouldn't have been able to live my version of the American dream. Ryan says these programs don't work - but I'm proof they do. 
[DO you oppose cuts to pell grants or not increasing pell grants (which they call a cut\) or both. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmf0?context=5)|Both.
[How will you guarantee that you won't be swayed by special interests,lobbyists, or party pressure?  How will YOU personally guarantee that you will be transparent, no last minute, Backdoor deals Rushed through congress without public opportunity to scrutinize, and no other sleazy behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57bxqs?context=5)|2/3) Honestly, I don't know. I've taken strong stands and haven't always fallen into line with the Democratic establishment. If I fall into some DC trap and end up rolling around with lobbyists, I'd hope the people would vote me out of office. For me, this campaign for Congress is just as much about process reform as it is policy reform, and that's why my legislative agenda will be guided by constituent committees and not DC think tanks and lobbying firms.
[Where do you stand on Gay Rights issues? Do you support full marriage rights? Civil Unions? Or are you supportive of DOMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57dauy?context=5)|I oppose discrimination in all forms. 
[What about transgender rights?  Do you support extending housing, employment, discrimination, and hate-crime laws to gender identity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57fluw?context=5)|I oppose discrimination in all forms. 
[Are there any parts of the Affordable Care Act that you disagree with? Why?What would you like to see done differently in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d8fy?context=5)|I support a single-payer, Medicare for all, system.
 |The ACA was a step in the right direction, but the premise for its creation was flawed. We have a healthcare problem, not a health insurance problem; so we need to approach the problem by first asking how we can achieve the best healthcare outcomes, not by first asking how we can get everyone to buy an insurance plan. 
[What do you think about the Supreme Court decision yesterday? What are you healthcare plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c95f?context=5)|The ACA is a step in the right direction, however I support a single-payer system. I was disappointed that single-payer models were never explored.
[What is your plan to fight against corporate money polluting politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57dfcf?context=5)|I support constitutional amendment to remove money from our election process by creating a system of publicly funded elections. Corporations are not people and money is not speech. 
[In your view, what's the correct way to get rid of Citizen's United?  Constitutional convention?  I just can't picture congress passing legislature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c7ua?context=5)|Constitutional Amendment. A convention will likely be needed, but in the short-term we need to start electing candidates that support publicly funded elections.
 |Post Citizens United, more people have become aware of the influence of money in democratic process and how it corrupts our system... I hope this issue reaches a tipping point sooner than later.
[With the national recognition Rep. Paul Ryan is building for himself (budget plan, potential VP candidate, etc.\), how does this affect your confidence and ability in running against him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d1z9?context=5)|I'm undeterred. It's become pretty clear that Ryan is going to use this district as a stepping stone to something else. People in the district see that he's spending less time in Wisconsin and more time in television studios and jetting around the country to raise money for Mitt Romney. It's difficult for him to make the case that he's working for the people of southeast Wisconsin when he's rarely here. 
[U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI. has a ""D"" rating by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America 2010 Congressional Report Card.  How do you feel about supporting the Veteran's?  It was in Wikipedia that Congressman Ryan was 16 years old when he found his father in bed, dead from a heart attack at age 55.  Do you know if the congressman and his family collected Social Security Survivor Benefits even though he was from a wealthy family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57ettu?context=5)|Ryan's position on Veteran care is appalling - he supports spending more money on bombs and less on soldiers and their families.
 |Ryan did collect Social Security benefits at age 16. In the past, he's said he saved the money to help pay for college. The system worked for him, so it's curious when he works to deprive others of the same benefits he has received. 
[Welcome back. Do you feel the failure to recall Scott Walker hurt your campaign any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cudy?context=5)|I do not. Democratic performance improved in my district, when comparing the 2010 and 2012 results. My district is also home to the successful State Senate recall that gave control of the Senate to the Democrats. I think the results in the southeastern corner of the state were promising for November.
[Hi Rob, as a displaced Wisconsonite living on the East Coast I am rooting for you. One quick question for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57eu1w?context=5)|You can help from anywhere! We have an online volunteer programs, so please sign up: [Volunteer for Rob Zerban for Congress](http://www.robzerban.com/crmapi/volunteer) 
[Rob Zerban!  I wanted to thank you for your hard work and dedication.  I've been supporting your campaign since you first appeared here on reddit, and will continue to support you until you unseat Paul Ryan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cuch?context=5)|Thank you for you support. Sounds like Jordan has has some technical difficulties, I'll let him know.
[That said, can you please ask Jordan Walker to not send me 9 copies of the same email in the same day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cuch?context=5)|I know we send out a lot of emails and phone calls, but we have to do everything we can to compete with Ryan's warchest. I appreciate your patience and understanding.  
[Obviously, social media has become an important tool in campaigning. I see that you have accounts on various sites (Facebook, Twitter, Apparent ""Spam Emails"" etc.\) but, so does your competitors.  Have you thought about using the Internet to create new, unique approaches (ex: some sort of ""Rob Zerban's Weekly Podcast Fire Side Chat""\) to help spread your message?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57df6c?context=5)|I like it! I will forward this over to my communications department. Thanks! 
[I'm in college and have an interest in politics, any advice on getting started? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57ejuk?context=5)|Get involved with a campaign! Do some research, find a candidate you can support and ask them to volunteer. The best way to learn is to do. 
[Do you ever stare at Paul Ryan and yell ""CHALLENGER!""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c04n?context=5)|No. We are cordial when our paths cross. 
[I finally heard of your campaign outside of Reddit.  I was sitting down next to the ""We Are Wisconsin"" folks on the big night(not a good night, just a big night\) and your name came up.  I'm glad to hear you're doing well.  How's your staffing going?   What are your internals looking like these days?  Most importantly, what would you say is the number one thing you wish you knew when you started your campaign that you know now?  Godspeed, take Ryan down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57el4i?context=5)|Things are going really well and we're building momentum. We've raised over $1 million already, which is more than Ryan's last 6 challengers combined. We recently launched our field program, which we're very excited about. Lots of interns have joined us in the last few weeks, and they have been a huge help (thanks!). 
[The last time i saw Ryan do a town hall meeting he was almost run out on a rail.  basically being called out on his insane balance the budget plan.  do you conduct town hall meetings?  and how are you received? good luck to you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cb7n?context=5)|I don't have town halls meetings, per se. We have done a campaign rally in every county and they were very well attended. I do speak to a lot of groups. I do a lot of interviews. I try to talk with everyone. I try to be available to everyone. In general I believe I'm well received.
 |Ryan's town hall meetings, which are calls ""listening sessions"" are comical. He basically gives a 30-40 minute power point presentation, and then allows his constituents ask questions for 20 minutes. They should be called ""lecturing sessions"" ...
 |Edit: spelling 
[Mr. Zerban, what do you expect to do for the young voters of America, if you get elected? Personally, I believe that the young voters (like me!\) would come out in droves for someone who ACTUALLY would be fighting for us, as opposed to just trying to keep us okay with them while they get the older vote. So, what makes you the candidate for reddit's demographic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e4gf?context=5)|Well, I don't know. It's up to redditors to decide if I'm the candidate for them. A congressional district has over 700,000 people, so your going to need to equitably represent people of all ages.
 |It's sad but true, young people are often discounted by politicians. They have relatively little money and influence, and they don't consistently vote. But there is hope! Young people are becoming more organized online, and traditional barriers to getting involved and active are breaking down. Think about what young people on reddit and the greater online community were able to do with the SOPA protests... imagine if young people replicated that effort for other issues, imagine if they did it every 3 months.
[Just a small follow up. So what would you do to make sure that the youth know that you aren't passing them over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmjn?context=5)|Decisions are made by the people that show up. It's easy to be cynical and bitch about politics on the internet, it's much harder to affect change. Wall Street doesn't get the legislation it wants by sitting around and complaining - they are ridiculously organized and active in the process. If you want Congress' attention, you are going to have to compete for it. I know the playing field isn't fair, and that means you're going to have to work harder.
 |You shouldn't be asking me how or if I'll 'pass over' the youth ... I shouldn't even have that option. It should be impossible to ignore you because your calling my office all hours of the night; because you are organizing in my district; because your waiting in the lobby when I show up in the morning. The greatest asset of the youth is its energy - that needs to be harnessed and directed.
 |I think you can tell a lot about someone's character by they way they treat those who can do nothing for them. I'm willing to talk with anyone and I try to reach out to everyone in every way I can.
 |The door to my congressional office will be open. The question is: Will you come in? 
[In the event Mr. Romney selects Mr. Ryan to his VPOTUS nominee, do you think your chances get better or worse? Any contingency plans in place? Do you think he would help or hurt Mr. Romney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57j3l1?context=5)|There isn't a lot of precedent for this scenario, and I've heard it analyzed a dozen different ways by a dozen different politicos.
 |What I do know is that when Paul Ryan is spending more time in TV studios, more time traveling around the country raising money for Mitt Romney, he's spending less time here in the 1st District talking to the voters that elect him.
 |It's hard to make the case you're honorably representing the people of southeast Wisconsin when you're spending all of your time in Ohio and Florida hosting $5,000/plate dinners.
 |Right now, I'm on the ballot opposite of Ryan this November, and that's the campaign I'm focused on.
[Republicans love to attack government spending with phrases like, ""It's the spending, stupid.""  Yet their cornerstone budget proposal, Paul Ryan's budget plan Path to Prosperity, increases the size of government 30-40% over the next ten years.  Why do I not hear Democrats pointing out this hypocrisy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e6u8?context=5)|Some do. More should.
 |It's laughable for someone like Ryan to style himself a deficit hawk, when he's voted for trillions in debt over the last 14 years. He's voted for the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" 3 times, but Pell Grants for college students are unaffordable? Give me a break.  
[Have you ever though about running a campaign with no money? Only using your free time &amp; social media to get your word out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57egm2?context=5)|Running a campaign without any money, would be very difficult. I have 7 staffers, interns, 4 offices, letterhead, postage, t-shirts, etc.  Social media is definitely changing the way campaigns communicate, but it's not at the point where you could be competitive using only social media. You still need to knock on doors, make calls, mail, TV, etc. Remember, senior citizens vote often and Facebook rarely.
[Hey Rib what kind of district are you running in demographically? what kind of things do you do to win over ryan die hards who are so fervent about his plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57fdy1?context=5)|Ryan's most fervent supporters don't live in Wisconsin. They live in NYC and Washington DC. You might assume that Ryan represents a heavily Republican district, but he doesn't. It's a moderate district that Obama carried in 2008.
 |Ryan hasn't faced reelection since authoring his first unpopular budget last year, and for the first time in 12 years Ryan will have a competitive challenger. We are reaching out to everyone and doing everything we can to gather the resources necessary to give voters a clear choice this fall. Ryan has grown out of touch, and I think when people hear my story and hear about the things I stand for, they will decide that I'm the one who is going to fight for them. 
[I really don't understand how any American can support a candidate (or, honestly a party\) who is willing to kill democracy by limiting voting rights/abilities/information, and yet we have seen quite a lot of it, mostly from the GOP.  I understand 'win at all costs' as a rallying cry, but why do Dems not wave this around like the tool it really is?  Why do we constantly hear flag-waving false patriotism from the GOP, but this (what I call\) suspension-of-democracy by limiting voting is never flung back in their faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|It's unfortunate that voter suppression efforts around the country aren't getting more attention. The Republican voter ID law here in Wisconsin was struck down by our courts, thankfully. This issue doesn't share in the larger debate because the people most affected by these laws are people that have the least influence; the poor, students, minorities, the elderly.
[ I'd also appreciate a few less calls and emails, but I'm still happy to support.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|The GOP has been working hard to perpetuate the myth of widespread voter fraud, for which there is little evidence. In reality, we should be more concerned with fraud on the back end of the booth, especially as electronic voting machines become more commonly used.
[If  how will you deal with an idea that you agree on, but your party will not. What will you do as an elected official to make our goverment solve problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57hni8?context=5)|Ultimately, I'll have my vote. I'll be there to represent the interests of my constituents, and if that means I cross party lines, then so be it. 
[**EDIT - It looks like you've answered just about every legitimate question in this thread except mine.  When I asked this question I wasn't holding my breath to get a reply and I'm still not. Saying you're gonna go after monopolistic banks who have committed criminal fraud in a public forum is political suicide and Rob Zerban knows who butters his bread, just like Paul Ryan  This is why we're truly screwed, no politician will stand up to power and say ""justice must be done or may the heavens fall"", instead all we hear is the same apologetic line about how we need to look forward and not backwards.**  Thank you for answering our questions Rob.  With all the financial fraud that's going on in the economy right now it seems that no one is being held criminally accountable and are only being subjected to corporate fines that are a small portion of the ill gotten gains.  Here are a few examples...  Wachovia Paid Trivial Fine for Nearly $400 Billion of Drug Related Money Laundering.  If you are elected into office, what steps will you take to make sure that the individuals who have perpetrated this fraud are criminally charged?  Will you go after banks that launder cartel drug money such as Wachovia did with 400 Billion dollars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57epk4?context=5)|If you commit a crime, you're a criminal, and you should be prosecuted.  Given that the financial service sector floods Congress with money, it's unlikely you'll see the criminal indictments many deserve. What can I do about financial crimes depends in large part on what committees I'm assigned to, but I can always bring attention to an issue, and work with other legislators who may serve on relevant committees.  Currently, when financial institutions are faced with fraud charges, they usually settle... and somehow get to keep half of the money they stole. If we let them keep half the money and no one goes to jail, why would they stop? The system for holding financial criminals accountable is completely toothless. It needs to change.  A lot of this all comes back to campaign finance, and the corrupting influence of money in politics. That is why I support publicly funded elections.  
[How do you feel about your chances of being elected with the handicap of having a ""z"" in your last name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57h0x9?context=5)|I'm optimistic that people with ""A-Y"" last names will overlook the sordid past of ""Z"" names and judge me on merits of my own character. I want little ""Z"" children to know that I too once stood at the end of every line in school, ever, and they can overcome their unfortunate alphabetically-determined position in the line to achieve great things as well. 
[General question for anyone in the political world.  But aren't you sick of politics? It drives me insane just reading about it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c6dm?context=5)|I hear ya... 
[Do you have an opinion on Gov. Walker's turning down of federal funds for high speed rail in Wisconsin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57g3su?context=5)|I support high speed rail. It would create jobs (at a time when we need them the most) and it would reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
[Last November, your state legalized concealed carry with no major issues (and even some lives saved\). Paul Ryan supports concealed carry, opposes assault weapon bans, and has an A rating from the NRA. With your support of gay rights and other civil liberties, can you be counted on to support our second amendment rights too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57h55q?context=5)|Yes. 
[Not a question, just saying good luck. Us Wisconsinites need to have our look changed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57iwu8?context=5)|Thank you! I appreciate your support. 
[Rob, I am encouraged by your candidacy, so thanks.  I'm not sure if you have answered in the previous AMA or elsewhere, but I was wondering what your position is on space exploration.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d2v9?context=5)|I'm for it. More knowledge is better than less knowledge.

vtz7m,10,2012-06-30,How does one get a CS job?,computer_engineer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vtz7m/how_does_one_get_a_cs_job/,"I just graduated with a degree in computer engineering and I can not seem to get any momentum with the job hunt. I finished my degree in 3 years by taking classes over the summer, because of this I did not do any internships. Last spring I applied for developer positions at microsoft, apple, and amazon, had some phone interviews and was ultimately rejected by all three. I went to my school's job fair, searched on craigslist, and replied to /forhire/ postings, but so far I have only heard back from 1 out of ~50 companies. Unfortunately I haven't heard back from that one company in two weeks, so I assume I was rejected from that also.  I signed up on roberthalf and another temp agency and have not gotten anything from them. 

My resume is very empty because I have only worked at my father's company, where I basically make/update excel spreadsheets for a few hours a week. So to fill the space, I just wrote about all the projects and relevant courses I did to get my degree. 


Is there anything that I should do to help me find a job? Should I apply to jobs that I am not necessarily qualified for? (C# jobs when I have little to no experience) Should I apply for other jobs not related to my degree at technology companies and hope to get transferred?  It just feels very frustrating not to have any control and to just wait around.
