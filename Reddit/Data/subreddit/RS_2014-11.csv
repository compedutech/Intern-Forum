The two I am most interested in are Development and Security. I have really enjoyed all my projects and assignments in my programming classes, but don't really know how that compares to real world dev work. On the security end, I have pretty limited knowledge, but am very interested in the subject, especially in pen testing.

I am currently hunting for dev internships for the summer, so hopefully I will get a taste of that soon, but security work seems harder to come by. How did you decide what you wanted to do for a career?"

Background: lost non-IT job in 2011, attempted to become self-employed in that field but missed licensing by 1 point on the exam. I wanted to be self-employed so that no single person would decide if I have income, besides myself. Live and die by my own means, you know? 

Went back to school for IT instead.

So I'm about to get my BSIT, I have a CCNA, MCSA and a good internship under my belt.

I find that, as I get shot down by employers or given the runaround by recruiters, the urge to be self-employed is coming back. 

**With my qualifications, what (if any) prospects are there for becoming self-employed in IT?** PC repair would be acceptable except the profitability seems poor. I'm really sick of dealing with hiring/firing, recruiters, and that nonsense.

Ideas?"

For example, should I include things from high school in my resume? Or do companies not really care at this point? I did just graduate in June of this year, so I haven't done much else besides what I did in high school.

So should I include that I was a varsity athlete &amp; state qualifying.. yada yada yada? Or my leadership in our competitive marching band? That way employers see that I wasn't just sitting on my ass with no job? Or would it make me look like a show-off loser that dwells on the past?

So I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I'm in the final year of my 4 year honours degree in game development. During our 3rd year we had a 6 month period where we went on an internship / paid placement. For my placement I worked for a very large computer company as a software engineer. The reason I chose to work there was to get experience in a different field as well as to have a big name on my CV.

I got on very well at my placement and the opportunity for a job there when I finish is reasonable high I would say. So where my dilemma lies, is if I were to be offered a job there out of college I would find it very difficult to turn down as it would pay well and would mean I could go straight from college into industry, but my problem is I really want to experience working in the game industry.

So my question is, if I took a job out of college for a couple years as a software engineer would it hurt my future opportunities to move to  a game development company and as a result does that mean I would have a better chance to join a game company straight from college?

Any advice would be really appreciated!"

After first few weeks of getting used I was (still am) thriving in my internship position. I constantly jump between backend to frontend and get my stuffs done quickly. Helped introduced many new tools, frameworks and even languages (Node.JS) etc into that company and everybody loves me and want me to work there after I graduate.

I'm really well set to be an web developer and I can see my perspective in this company or similar companies in Texas or other similar states. I recently got into mobile development with iOS and Android and I'm also doing really great in this side project and making progress swiftly(get the pun?). And I think I can be such good mobile developer too. 

However, the dilemma I've is that I have one year left to graduate (two semesters and one summer), should I keep doing in this path of web developer and mobile developer ( which is my comfort zone) or spent this one year on data structure, algorithms, github building, oss contribution and interview question mastery to get into Big Four companies? 
While focussing on web dev and mobile dev, I've neglected my core cs courses such as data structures, algorithms, automata etc. and I think I'm weak at those. Is it really wise decision to spent one year mastering and preping with data structures, algorithms and github to get into Big Four or I should stop about that get better at web dev and mobile dev?

Like in my freshman/sophomore years when I decided web dev is for me, I don't know what to do and I'm at this crossroad.

I went to an internship over summer break and suddenly received word that we are pretty much out of funding. When I returned I found out that two out of three other students (one a 3rd year PhD student) in the group went back to their home countries. My advisor made excuses that they just weren't working quickly enough and gave up. I took over part of what one of them was doing and found out that some published papers have incorrect numbers. When I dug into this I found out that the Prof. was telling the researcher to measure a key width by holding it up to lines on a paper and estimating how close it was. This width was already just a few cm so the errors made a big difference. I told the Prof. about the error and he kind of blew it off and once again blamed the work ethic of the guy who left. To top it all off, he is currently non-tenure and should have an evaluation in the next couple years and if they know about all this, I don't think he will pass. 


To those who have done something like this before, what is the most correct way to go about switching? Do I talk to the department head and voice my concerns about the incorrect numbers in the published papers? If I want to keep doing the same topic I will likely have to switch departments so should I go directly to one of their professors and ask him if I can join his group? I don't want to harm the remaining student or even the Prof. with how I go about this but is there anyway to keep that from happening?"

For the last ten months, it's mainly been C++ and scripting, because that was what I did at my internship last summer, and that's what I've been doing in courses since last spring. I recently had two phone interviews with a company I really want to work at, and while both interviewers said that any language was okay, the first interviewer gave me the problem in Java syntax, and the second interviewer said he was less familiar with C++ than I was.

What I did was okay, as they invited me to an onsite, but I think it would behoove me to code in Java when I'm there. I want to aggressively refamiliarize myself with Java's libraries, its lesser-used syntax (such as bit manipulation), and whatever other Java chops I need to demonstrate. Any resources out there or projects that would require me to use and become familiar with a wide variety of Java data structures that you can recommend?

**EDIT:** also, learning things about implementation, for example the starting size of an ArrayList or HashMap on initialization, and how often they reallocate would probably be useful."

Some quick background, I graduated from a top 20 CS school with 3 internships and went to go work for a pretty large well known software company (not a top 4/5) after graduating. After spending 2 years there I got promoted and decided to try for a new position to get better experience. So, I found a startup that seemed to fit the bill. Small engineering team of ~10 engineers, mostly senior people (turns out I'd be the most junior one). Company itself was growing and had been around for about 4 years. I'd be working with a bunch of new frameworks and languages, the job seemed like a great learning experience so I decided to go for it.

At this point I've been in this position for 3.5 months now and I feel like I'm still a step behind where I'm expected to be. At first I thought it was because of the huge learning curve of jumping into a ton of stuff I wasn't familiar with at all but at this point I can't really blame that anymore. A combination of devs not having the time to sit down and go over current architecture or do design reviews, documentation/comments being really sparse and no unit/functional testing has made it a bit tough to get adjusted. Most devs here work ~50-55 hour weeks normally, so having to put up with the expected workload while trying to figure a lot of this stuff out has made for a couple stressful months.

The other week I had my lead pull me aside last week and let me know that if my current output keeps up he doesn't think I'll be a good fit for this company. The expectation at this point was that I'd be up to speed and as productive as the other devs. It definitely seems like they were expecting someone more senior for the role which I don't think I'm cut out for at this point. It's been a great learning experience here and I've been willing to put in the time but I'm not sure if it's worth staying in at this point, especially with the looming threat of being fired hanging over my head now.

At this point I'm wondering if I should stick around and keep trying or find another job I'm more comfortable with. Anyone have experiences with this kind of situation?"

I know how to solve the problem, but to write the problem in code, without Google I'm almost useless.

I feel pretty fake, because everyone has told me I'm doing a great job and learning well, but I just feel like I can Google well.

I guess right now I'm most proficient in Javascript, but I just don't really like it and its probably not the most versatile, although I might be wrong, it seems like a fad right now.

Right now, if I need to solve a problem or write code for something, I need to look up every little detail on Google. I'll have a very good idea what I'm looking for or searching for, but I just don't know the syntax or details to do it on my own without a reference.

It would be nice to be able to have enough proficiency that if someone asked me to solve a programming task I could do it from my head without looking every little thing up.

C++ has been my favourite language to use, I don't know why, it just seemed to make sense to me off the bat.

I have been looking at Go, and it seems very cool.

And Go works with Google App Engine, so perhaps I can make cool things with that.

Should I learn something that is more common?"

My primary interest is computer architecture and hardware. A lot of times I hear ""we will all get jobs super easily since we are compE's here"" but I am worried that because I'm an international student I wont. I looked at a bunch of internships and jobs and 90% of them require or prefer you to be a US citizen or green card holder. 
Additionally, I have talked to other internationals who have expressed similar worry over this.

I really want to stay in the US as I have been here for a long time now, and whats worse is that companies like Texas Instruments, who I would love to work for, won't take internationals for almost all their positions (if not all), despite the fact that I go to the 5th best program in the nation, they don't want me.

Smaller companies are also unable to give sponsorship to international hires.

Anyone on this sub who has had or heard of a similar experience and how did it turn out?

2l6bdg,2,2014-11-03,School and GPA requirements for technical consulting,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2l6bdg/school_and_gpa_requirements_for_technical/,"So I am about to have a computer science degree from a typical state school. I have completed many projects in my free time as a programming hobbyist and I feel I am strong at answering both technical and non-technical subjects in interviews. I also have a year and a half of internship experience developing enterprise software at a large financial company. My GPA is about 2.9 (hopefully will pull up to a 3 after my last semester is completed but I'm not counting on it). Its mostly because I'm a bit of a workaholic that stretches himself thin. 

I also have always felt like the goal of school is to learn rather than to get high grades. If busting my ass to get a good grade adds less to my knowledge than spending time pursuing my own hobby programming and other interests I have a hard time motivating myself to get more than a B. I don't feel like this reflects on my workplace work ethic since the goal there is to provide a good product or service to the team or client.

I just interviewed with a less-famous consulting firm which does both management and technology consulting. I got to the final round (which consisted of a two day several-interview process) and I think it went really well. I had the VPs giving me positive feedback as I was leaving, something other candidates I spoke to did not get. I expect to hear back from them with positive news but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. This has inspired me to consider consulting more seriously as it seems like an amazing field. Originally I was planning on going into software development for a typical big tech company but now I'm seriously considering what other kinds of consulting companies I could get an interview with. 

My question is, what places will consider me despite my GPA and non-target school? I know MBB is out of the question, and honestly I'd feel a little intimidated working alongside the likes of Rhodes Scholars.... What are companies like Accenture like?

Thanks!"

2l6ktj,1,2014-11-03,"BS Business Admin Degree in 2013, still stuck in low wage jobs and can't break into anything entry level. Interested in becoming a Business Analyst or Financial Analyst. Advice?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2l6ktj/bs_business_admin_degree_in_2013_still_stuck_in/,"TLDR: BS in Business, learning SQL and Advanced Excel, stuck in low wage jobs/being told I can't get out of low wage jobs, advice?
.
**How do I get that first entry level job?**
.
So where to begin.....
.
I've been struggling pretty hard since 2008. 
.
**Some Stats**
.
* Worked as cashier from high school to 2008
* Lost job at end of 2008 enrolled in a community college
* Graduated with an Associates in Liberal Arts, 3.8 GPA in 2010
* Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from a small private non-profit college, 2.9 GPA in early 2013
* Worked as Dish washer while going to college
* Couldn't get an internship while in college or after graduating
* Unemployed for 8 months after graduating and then found a job doing manual labor in a warehouse, still my current job
* Currently 30, $40,000 in student loan debt (I can't even pay), no savings, no retirement, working six days a week breaking my back to afford my tiny studio apartment and high millage old used car. 
* In a major metro area with around 5 million people
* I make close to the federal poverty level in wages for a single person for the year
.
**I can't: **
* Relocate, I just renewed a 1 year lease for my apartment and I don't have savings to move with
* Move back in with parents, that's not an option
.
.
So I find the stock market very interesting, the valuation of companies very interesting and looking at data very interesting. I thought that becoming a Financial Analyst looked like a job that I would enjoy. I've tried applying to entry level positions and internships but I've been unable to get an interview for ether. 
.
I thought that being a Business Analyst looked interesting as well. I'm currently trying to teach my self SQL through the internet and I am very good with Excel. I've also been applying to entry level Business Analyst positions and internships with no results. 
.
I've had my resume professionally redone several times and I've had interview coaching, but I keep getting a response back ""You don't have enough experience"" for entry level positions and internships ""We are only interested in current college students"" or I never heard back. I've gone to many job fairs and networking events with no success to break into the entry level business world.
.
I've been able to get interviews and job offers for low wage retail/manual labor jobs. I've tried to become a teller at a bank or customer service representative with a bank to get my foot in the door but I keep getting told I am unqualified to be a bank teller or customer service representative for a bank because of lack of bank experience. I've tried to get in with Robert Half, Accountemps, Office team to get office experience but they told me they couldn't place me in any positions what so ever because of a lack of previous office experience. 
.
I got a Bachelor of Science as opposed to a Bachelor of Arts by taking extra Accounting, Finance and Statistics classes. I thought that would make me more employable. But I've been stuck in the same low wage jobs that I had before I went to college. 
.
My current employer is a high turn over job doing manual labor in a warehouse. I have a good reputation as a hard worker and someone who has stuck around. I've looked at some of the internal corporate postings and to move into corporate they require at minimum masters degrees and 10 years of experience for almost all entry level corporate postings. Talking to my managers they do not think that I would be able to move beyond my current level with out the experience and education they now require (They didn't require all this extra stuff back before 2008). I really want to get out of back breaking work and do work with a computer.
.
My biggest goal is to ~~be able to find a career I enjoy,~~ make a wage that pays enough to survive and pay off my student loans. 
.
.
.
Any advice besides trying to find a time machine before all this outsourcing and ridiculous education/experience requirements stuff started?

So I received two offers for Summer 2015 internships - one from Company A, and one from Company B.  Both are big companies in Wisconsin.  Company A is willing to pay roughly $25/hour, while Company B will only be paying $17.50/hour.

I understand that the difference between these pay figure is astounding and should make this an obvious decision, but the position at Company A is more of ""Technology Leadership"" position, while Company B is an actual programming position.  I would really like to program, and from talking to the people at Company A it sounds like my work there wouldn't involve much, if any, programming.  I have also attended an open house at Company A, and I really love the environment and people there.  I could certainly see myself being happy with a full-time position at this company after graduation.

What would your advice be in this situation?"

*One month and Three Weeks after the Vancouver Incident*

It had taken them an entire week to limp their way to the Third Planet of the Epsilon Eridani system. The Ships head engineer had survived the explosion that had occurred with the missile had impacted the Bladed Claw. Unfortunately for him, without access to a fully stocked med-bay he would never walk again, his legs having been crushed by a collapsing bulkhead. He was quickly turned into an instructor as SSgt Brooks started pumping him for information in order to keep everyone alive. 

Epsilon Eridani - 3 was a beautiful world. Gravity was one G, Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere. No apparent toxins or pathogens in the air that could cause the Humans on board any problems. Dr. Cranex however was worried about the rest of the crew. The gravity was 30% greater then what was galactic standard and the atmosphere thicker. It was frankly perfect for the combination of military and civilian personnel.  

Capt. Drake felt the planet was beautiful as it filled the view screen, but it wasn’t home. It was untouched wilderness with its own challenges to their continued survival. Thankfully only the Corti had bothered to chart the systems within about twenty light-years of Earth. None of them had been interesting to the Corti save Earth, and the lack of any Temperate worlds Class 9 or below they were seen as uninhabitable to the other races of the Dominion.  

They had to survive first, then they had to find others. If thirty-four of them had been abducted by the crew of the Bladed Claw, then the number of humans out there could have been in the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions. Jackson Drake, and the majority of the humans on board, had all sworn oaths to defend their countries and their peoples from all enemies foreign and domestic.  

But what was the operational objective? He had thought about that over the last week as they had tried to learn how to fly this alien craft to safety. It was clear to him that Earth was in danger. Who that danger was from was up for debate. The Corti Directorate definitely ranked up there. The Hunters not far behind on Drake’s scale. The Hunters were for all intents and purposes Ambush predators/cannibals. They could be defeated with minimal effort it seemed. The Corti however were amoral scientists that would be facing life sentences back home if they had tried any of their actions within Earth Jurisdictions… most of them at least. 

Then there was the Celzi Alliance, they were currently at war with the Interspecies Dominion from the limited amount of intel they could gather from the ships database. That was another thing they needed, information. When they got back to Earth, not if, then they would need to be able to let their respective commands know of the general and specific details of life out here as they could. The database was the first step. 

One of the abuductees on board was a detective with the NYPD, a Claudia Dresden. Det. Dresden had been collecting evidence and assessing all the information they had available to them and had kept Drake up to date on what she had learned. For now she was their best choice for an intelligence officer. There was just so much they didn’t know, that they needed to know. The state of the Galaxy, the politics, the economics. They needed that information, if only so they could determine their next course of action. 

Clearly they had to return to Earth. The ship provided a fully operational FTL drive, at least according to Brooks. The only reason they couldn’t use it at the moment was because they weren’t certain on what damage may have occurred when they were hit. 
He hit the public address button on the central chair and spoke, “Alright everyone, we are about to make planet fall. Strap yourself in and hold on tight, we may encounter a little bit of turbulence and then… explode.” 

A few people on the bridge couldn’t help but chuckle at that. Seaman Matthews had figured out how to fly the ship rather easily once he figured out what controls were what. Navigation towards Epsilon-3 had been easy enough with the ships navigation suite. They had made orbit that same day and drilled the survivors of the crew hard for the last day about re-entry procedures. It seemed a lot of things had been automated to the point of excluding the need for an organic pilot.  

One of the other soldiers had medic training. Specialist DuFrane had been learning from Cranex. DuFrane had been working towards a Medical Degree, hoping to get his commission and serve as a medical officer. When asked, the man had said he wanted to help people as best he could, to cure them instead of making them feel better while they died. Cranex had begrudgingly accepted him as an intern. Drake had everyone he could all over the ship, trying to keep them busy while he figured out their next move. 

Maybe things would become clearer on solid ground. "

Prior to this fall semester I had some extenuating circumstances that forced me to move about an hour and a half away. I then applied and was accepted to an internship with the county government where I now live. Moving forced me to switch to my schools online Software Engineering degree.

I didn't find the online courses very fulfilling and felt I wasn't learning a whole lot so I decided to switch back to CS on campus for the upcoming spring semester. The online program is also very new so I was one of the furthest along in the degree. I wasn't able to register for some classes that I was able to get into because the classes were not created yet due to the lack of students who were at that same level.

I told my boss that I might be moving back down to go to in person classes. They said that if I stay I will have a job working there. The starting hourly salary is about $21 an hour and the starting salaried position is about 50-55 thousand a year. I'm not sure exactly what I would be getting paid but I assume the hourly pay. Seems crazy to be offered something like after working jobs that paid slightly over minimum wage.

I have a few options here

1. Stay up here, take the position and stay in the online program
2. Stay up here, take the position and switch to a private school (ERAU) as a software engineering major. (This program is a little different as far as degree requirements. More physics classes for instance. The tuition is also far more than the state school but may be doable if I get scholarships)
3. Decline the position and move back down.

I can choose between taking a class on Compilers and a class on OS. Eventually I will end up taking both classes, but the one I take this spring will affect me during the Fall recruiting cycle.

So my question basically is, which one should I take first?"

**PSU:** Corsair HX 1050

**2nd CPU Cooler:** Corsair H80 CPU cooler

**HDD:** I don't know what we use

**SSD:** Samsung 840 EVO 500GB 

**RAM:** 32GB Corsair Vengence 1600

___________________________________________________________________________

I've called with the guy and though it be useful to note why he chose the parts

**CPU:** Dual Xeon, lots of cores, useful for videoediting

**MoBo:** Supports the CPU's and 64GB RAM

**Memory:** Same as the 32GB that we're already using

**Storage:** SSD and HDD won't be replaced

**GPU:** This is where I have my doubts. It has 1664 CUDA which is important for the Adobe software we use. The 780 Ti has 2880 CUDA so what is the main diffrence between these cards? Let me know!

**PSU:** Won't be replaced

**Case:** Most ugly case imo. He chose it because it supports the MoBo EEB formfactor but for what I could find there are a lot of better (?) and better looking cases that also support EEB. He said the case was massive and had good cablemanagement support. I found that some other guy here build with the Panthoo Primo and the same motherboard, that case was in the same (expensive!) price range as the one the guy chose. Any tips for this? 

**Case Fans:** I think he bought these before. Corsair SP120 or something seems good to me, more expensive but that doesn't really matter. If it's worth it to upgrade all the fans, even the h80 fans and case fans to corsair fans, let me know.

I live in the Midwest in an area with almost no local software developer or internship positions but am willing to relocate anywhere for a job. I graduated in May 2013 with a BA in Computer Science. Since then I have applied to hundreds of jobs all over the United States, had dozens of interviews, and so far have had no luck finding a position. 

I have no internship experience as when I was in college my professors told me it was unnecessary and that ""I could find a job anywhere"". That was obviously not true as I now know. Unfortunately, now that I'm graduated no internships will hire me as every one I apply to says they are looking for college students even though most of them would be perfect for my skill level and need for experience. I'm not even looking for top jobs, I will work almost anywhere just to get experience. 

It's been 18 months since I graduated... should I continue applying or is there another option? I feel like I could be a great fit at a company but nobody's luck can be this bad right? My family has suggested that I possibly go to graduate school as another option. I realize that would be expensive but is it the best option to get me more experience and make my job search easier? 

I'd appreciate any advice."

**TL;DR** Would like if someone in the music industry (specifically artist booking, management or A&amp;R), could take a look at my resume and cover letter and tell me what they think I should change to possibly hook some interviews.

I recently moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a booking agent for music artists in the field of electronic music or try to become an artist agent or A&amp;R/Talent agent.

I have a lot of past experience in putting on events and have a lot of knowledge within the genre of electronic music but due to the lack of my network, I am having a lot of difficulty getting my foot in the door. I've tried everything from trying to get internships or opportunities for temp. work to prove that I am more than competent, but no place offers those kinds of deals to people out of college or have temp. work positions.

I've sent out a ""million"" resumes, have 2 different temp. agencies helping me (although I am unsure about how hard they look for jobs for each candidate), have been going to all types of meet ups just to try and meet people, yet still nothing....

I would appreciate if someone in this field of work could possibly look at my resume and and cover letter and maybe give me some pointers or just tell me about what steps they took to help them get hired. 

Much appreciated!"

I’m a freshman computer science major, and I’m already having second thoughts about my major. I chose to pursue computer science because I love programming, and I’m very happy to have gotten into the major at UCSD. I have about 5 years of programming under my belt, along with internship experience with a local San Diego tech start up. At that job, I’ve been primarily using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP and I’ve since learned that I love designing and coding websites. To the extent that I would consider Web Development as a career.

Now I’m taking CSE11 for my introductory Java course and it’s just the right difficulty that I’m relearning material in greater depth without the course feeling slow. But I can’t help but feel the assignments are so bland: everyone turns in the same project, with little room to take what we’ve learned and be creative with it. 

My question is if at some point I will get some creative freedom over the assignments, or if computer science courses are all like this, and is computer science even the most relevant major for an aspiring web developer?

Thanks for the feedback!"

I was doing .NET development.  I worked full-time (paid) for 2 or 3 months.  A couple days ago I found out that they trashed everything that I worked on.  Supposedly because it was not worth using.  

I've never felt like such a complete waste of flesh in my life.  Where do I go from here?  I'm pretty sure I gave that internship everything that I have as a programmer.  

I'm halfway through college and I guess I can change majors if I want, but I don't want to because of how ridiculously valuable a degree in Computer Science is.  Also, if I finish with this degree, I'm already going to be $100,000+ in debt.  Changing majors would only make it worse - especially since I'd probably transfer into something that isn't as well paid.

I guess what I'm asking is, if I'm going to be bad at programming in the real world, should I even bother getting the degree?  As crazy as this sounds, are there other things that I can do with a CS degree that don't put such a heavy emphasis on coding?

Starting salaries for software engineers in my area is ~60k. My question is with the knowledge of 4 years of experience making 80k here, is it feasible to use that in my own salary negotiations? So if no experience is 60k, 4 years is 80k, if I request 70k is that unreasonable?"

Or am I just looking at this wrong and there's a specific answer they want.

My first internship was a bit of a letdown, I was a lab tech in a manufacturing plant. Second one was much more awesome, working in R&amp;D for a consumer product company where I was really able to take ownership and initiative in leading a lot of projects and assignments.

I'd really like to explore the automotive/aerospace field, particularly either in manufacturing or in development. My past internships aren't giving me any particular expertise in those fields and in those areas. In interviewing for the summer for 2-3 companies, I made it past through the initial screening and to final interviews, but did not manage to secure any offers. In all those cases, I was interested in a manufacturing/development position.

Starting now including the upcoming spring semester, I'd really like to make myself marketable towards obtaining those positions. My GPA is good and I am involved in positions of leadership on campus, so I feel what is really holding me back is a lack of experience/interest in working in the areas I am applying to. I have the opportunity to take some classes that concentrate on automotive/aerospace/manufacturing areas, but am hesitant about increasing an already heavy workload as those classes do not involve any hands-on projects or experiences.

I have had two internships, both of them related to web development on the front end. One during summer 2013 and another during summer of 2014. During and after this last summer, I have been contacted by many recruiters. They email/call me with new open positions that companies have. I interviewed at a couple but have yet to successfully get an offer.

I find that during interviews, most technical questions involve data structures and algorithms, both of which I have not had classes in. What has gotten me through most skepticism is my self-motivated desire to learn outside of classes. I've learned most of JavaScript and JS frameworks online; I make sure to tell them I learned most of my web dev knowledge outside of school which usually impresses HR recruiters, but makes technical recruiters skeptical.

I'm a bit worried that I'm exhausting my options very quickly. I am currently learning algorithms through online lectures. If I interview at multiple companies and get rejected because my algorithm knowledge is bad, they may not want to interview me in the future because they have my interview record on file or something.

On one hand, I don't have a job yet and I'm still actively looking. But if I interview at too many places, I might run out of options. Then what? Should I stop applying to places and only do so once I get a firm grasp on algorithms? Should I apply to less technical (more design oriented) positions? My applications have been for front-end development positions, which many say that the relevance of algorithms and data structures is debate-able."

&gt; Age: 24

&gt; Education: BA in Economics from a University. Graduated Last December ('13)

&gt; Location: Los Angeles


**Current Situation**

Interning at a startup (approaching my 4th year). Position for which I'm interning for is called ""Technical Services"". We pretty much use an in house proprietary data manipulation software one of the developers made. It uses syntax that's very similar to SQL. We also occasionally dabble in terminal. I've learned a lot here but they are currently in some financial lock. They can't bring me aboard salaried even though I'm putting in 45+ hours a week. They dangled the possibility of employment after the holidays but quite frankly I'm not sure if its a good idea as I'm putting in a ton of hours as an intern now, I know it'll only go up even more when I'm salaried.

I've been learning Ruby on my free time whenever I get the chance. I've been using this site [Link](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) and I've gotten about halfway (twice) through in a span of two months for reiteration. About to start the latter half this weekend. This is in a span of two months. Now with the limited free time I have (3-5 hrs on the weekends), I'm thinking I should probably devote more time to learn what I need. At my current pace, I'm not even sure how long it'll take me to be adept enough for an entry programming job.

I am shocked they haven't kicked me out of the program, and though I am extremely grateful, I feel that I am just wasting their time and my time at this point. This is a big deal to me because they land you very good paid internships, and I don't even know how I would go about getting one myself without them. 

I'm unsure about what to do; if anyone has any advice, that would be great; thanks. "

I have received an email from job A today, about them being happy to have me and to come over tomorrow afternoon to talk money and details.

Problem is (well, a good thing actually) that I've passed a phone interview and code assigment throughout last two weeks at job B, they scheduled interview this Friday afternoon, which would probably stretch uncertainty until Monday at least.

Job A:
frontend dev @ a small yet well off html5 game company, who makes several projects per year
- small team
- entry salary 

Job B
jr frontend engineer @ a large and world known company who has an online platform selling memberhsips to companies and individuals
- well known large company, popular online platform, has tons of users.
- superb reviews at glassdoor
- salary unknown yet, but may be same or higher than job A.

I slightly prefer Job B that's why all the confusion.

Some other details:
- my experience is basically 1 year (internship at a startup, freelance)
- location of jobs is basically the same
- Stability is very important at this moment (to the point where if I don't get any of those jobs, I would have to go to a warehouse to earn rent and food money). I'd say quite low risk tolerance.
- Salary doesn't matter that much, since it's gonna be enough for me either way.

2lfolu,9,2014-11-05,"Renegotiate, jump ship, stay with it",Ttiamus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lfolu/renegotiate_jump_ship_stay_with_it/,"I graduated in May and currently work for a subcontractor on a decently sized federal contract. During my last semester of school, I had trouble finding work after an internship so by the time I was offered this job in July, I was running low on funds. The job is working Maintenance on Java web apps as well as some development of new ones, but mostly just maintenance. 

This job is paying at 35k with fairly average benefits with a bonus of getting a Secret Clearance. Low end of average in my area is 45k fresh out of school for developers, but since I was running out of funds, I jumped on it when the company said that was the most they could do. I later found out after seeing emails between my company and the main contractor, that this position was budgeted 60k from the contractor. 

My initial plan was to stay with this company for about a year to get some more experience, since all I really have before this is a couple months at an internship and some side projects I'm working on now. The more I do at the job though the more I realize I'm being paid way too little to put up with a lot of this mess with the government red tape. 

The way I see current options are like this...

1. The company does yearly evaluations around Christmas. From everything I've been told this is the only time that I can be given a raise. At that point I'll have been with the company for 5 months, but only really working on projects for about two months. Because of the short time, I'm not really expecting to be able to get up into that 50-60k range from where I'm at now. Also from what I've heard from talking to other people on base, my company has become known for underpaying.

2. I can proceed to fill out applications currently and switch as soon as possible. My biggest concern here is I haven't been a part of much yet with the company, so I wouldn't have much to talk about my time spent with them in future interviews, and I don't know how well leaving after only a few months would look. 

3. Stick with the current plan of staying about a year then find a different job. I've just about decided that I don't really want to work for the federal government if I can help it, but that's also 75% of the work in my area. 

Any advice on a course of action going forward? Or just advice in general. Thanks everyone!"
2lfpnf,2,2014-11-05,TIFU by accidentally agreeing to pay €900 for a really bad film,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lfpnf/tifu_by_accidentally_agreeing_to_pay_900_for_a/,"For some backstory, I've been organising a pretty big two-day conference for the last seven months in between Uni and summer. The thing just happened a couple of weeks ago and everything went well, we had a great line up of speakers and multi-media stuff, and people actually showed up and were engaged.

I was patting myself on the back for managing to pull it off with pretty much zero experience and getting through it all alive. The only thing is the conference, I now believe, is cursed.

The thing had problems from day one, the NGO we were working with couldn't even get a bank account sorted (al the banks were too 'unethical') and when the original conference director got some swanky job abroad I was selected to take over. I led a team of all unpaid student interns (including myself) for a couple of months with this NGO until I went off on a long planned trip over summer, thinking everything was pretty much sorted and the rest of the team could take over from here. 

Then one day, half way through my trip on the other side of the world I get an email from our intern treasurer telling me that the conference has been cancelled. The NGO decided that they didn't really know what they were doing, and it was getting too late without enough being organised (especially on their part with the bank account, the programme and speakers were sorted). At this point I think hey fuck them! I busted my guts over this for six months and now they're *cancelling*? I didn't sign anything, I'm resigning and taking the conference with me! I know, karma's a bitch. so I quit and we take the conference to another, better NGO, a new intern team is selected and we're good to go.

Then all the shit goes down, first one keynote's flight is too expensive so I find a kind company to foot the bill, then the speaker cancels on us. I replace her. Then our second keynote speaker cancels, at which point I get so sick i'm almost admitted to a dodgy Asian hospital and cut my trip short to fly home and recover/fix this shitfest of a conference. i find another keynote. OK back on track.

In the middle of all this I move to a different city and start a new University course. 

Three days before and the intern team is asking how to get hold of one of the films we were going to show, recommended by a higher up. I send some emails inquiring, as I thought it had already been confirmed.

Here's where shit really goes down. The leader of the NGO who was supposed to be chairing the thing/ supporting us interns gets sick and is HOSPITALISED the night before the conference is due to start. I, of course, am left to pick up and keep going, so have to write welcome and closing speeches, and generally stand up on the podium and lead the whole event (I hate public speaking). 

Remember that film? Yeah, well it turns out in all the confusion and chaos i'd overlooked a crucial thing. The fuckers were asking €900 to rent the film. Because of the way they phrased it, as well as my chicken-headed stress, I interpret it as being €900 for flights for the director to speak, as well as the rental. I said we can't pay that, and can't they donate the film like all the other artists? I get an aggressive email slating me for not having 'high ideals' and I say of course we'll pay the rental, we support artists rights! I thought the rental fees were going to be max €100 or something.

I was so, so wrong. Now I have a €900 rental fee with an international film agency chasing me up, and no money as we spent our measly grants on making the conference happen, and then the small profits on reimbursements. The leftovers are no where near €900.


**tl;dr** TIFU by promising €900 which we don't have to international film company in midst of stress and panic after organising conference from hell."

I've wanted a gaming rig for a long time and this was the first time I could afford one.



A couple of months ago I was just about to pull the trigger on a prebuildt one since I've never built one before. But I asked around here and a few redditors convinced me and helped me out. And I found out that one of my friends was familiar with building PCs so helped med with part picking and the build process.




I am so happy with the result and I am glad that I now have a PC that I can upgrade and not having to spend a lot of money on a new one in a couple of years.





There is just one thing, that isn't really a problem but it is an irregularity that I would rather be without. Sometimes my monitor has a kind of a line. It's hard to explain but almost like a wave that the old VCRs would have after a while. Or if you could picture you pulling your finger on water and causing movement in the water, except the wave would be in a thin straight line.
Now I don't know if it is because of the rig, some driver issues or because of my old screen, it's a ""generic PnP screen"", 27"" from LG. And it happens sometimes when I game and sometimes when I browse the Internet.


And while we're on the subject I am thinking of buying a new monitor. Not now but in the possible near future. And I don't what to go with.

All I know I want is a 27""  since I've grown accustomed to it. But I wonder how much of a strain a 1440p monitor would have on my card? Would it be better to go with a 144hz 1080p monitor instead?
Because I might add a second screen so later on.

 In terms of what I would be doing, Oracle and Facset are a tad obscure but Im pretty sure they offer super exiting projects. For the startup, I would strictly be working on their IOS app.
I dont think I can mention the salary information but they are all pretty much the same.  You can look up the oracle salary here: http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Oracle-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1737_D_KO7,24.htm. The other 2 companies pay SLIGHTLY less.
Oracle is in San Francisco, the other 2 are in downtown Austin

What worries me about the startup is that while they have told me they will help me with the h1b visa and a green card later on, I am scared. I dont know if they will be around for another 5 years, and if that happens I dont know if I will be able to find another job due to my visa status

I know Oracle helps me get a green card as soon as I begin. Factset its after working 5 years for them. 
Oracle's green card offer seems awesome but I dont know how much it would help me since I will only have a BS in computer science so I need 5 years of experience to file for one .

I currently work as an intern for the startup and I love all the people there. So I know the environment is amazing.

Friday came along and it was repatched to look less ugly. Then came Monday, seeing as I had to be at school I had no idea of the dramas the company was having after the repatching.  Also, because it was a Monday, I didn't get home till 7PM because of training.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I get home, knackered from 4 hours of training I jumped in the shower before having dinner.  While I was having dinner dad came into the dining room.

&gt;Dad: G'day boyo, fun day?

&gt;Me: Nya, school is school, still trying to stick my front layout full.

&gt;Dad: You will get it eventually.  Someone named [Corporate Managers name] called wanting to talk to you about something urgent.

&gt;Me: That's the Corporate Manager, I'll see her at work tomorrow. 

&gt;Dad: All right.

and dad went back to doing whatever he was doing before seeing I was home.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I get to the office and sign into the time book at reception, I notice the CorpMgr name not in the book yet.  So I strike up a conversation with the receptionist.

&gt;Me: Good Morning receptionist, do you know if CorpMgr is in yet?  I don't see her name in the book.

&gt;Receptionist: I don't think she is, she usually gets in a little later.

&gt;Me: OK, can you do me a favour? When she gets in can you let me know or get her to come in and see me please? 

[insert 17 year old puppy dog eyes]

&gt;Receptionist:  Sure, I'll let her know you are looking for her.

&gt;Me: Thank you very much.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I entered the colour crayon office which shares with IT purely because they had a spare desk, I get to my ""workstation"", the media server which dishes out all the adverts to our remote units, and login.

Waiting......

Waiting......

Waiting......

This is taking its time.  Then the phone rings.

&gt;Me: G'day Slazer speaking.

&gt;Receptionist: Heyyo, do you know why the network is running so slow? It takes ages to do anything.

&gt;Me:  No, I am still waiting for my machine to login.  I'll let you know what happens.

&gt;Receptionist: Thank you.

Still waiting to login..........

Still waiting........

YAY, 2 min passed and it has logged in, but outlook is saying it can't contact the exchange server. Odd, so I ping the exchange server.

Time out.

Time out.

Time out

Replied 600ms

Time out

Time out

Replied 1500ms

What the frack?  I pop open task manager and the network is pegged at 100% utilisation. Not good.  I check the other computers in the colour crayon office and they are all 100% network usage.  What the frack??? Queue the CorpMgr

&gt;CorpMgr: Morning Slazer, any idea what is happening?

&gt;Me: Maybe, did the IT contractor come in and repatch the comms rack on the weekend?

&gt;CorpMgr: According the them they did, but when I spoke with them yesterday what they did on the weekend shouldn't be causing this and they can't get anyone out till Thursday.

&gt;Me: ...... How much are we paying them for support again?

&gt;CorpMgr: Too much it would appear.  We plan to give them the boot when you finish high school and let you handle it all.

&gt;Me: ....... I guessed as much from the chat I had with OpsMgr at the end of last year, but that is a discussion for another time.  Let me sort out what is happening with the network and I will provide you with a report.

&gt;CorpMgr: Sounds good.

CorpMgr returns back to her desk as the colour crayon manager walks in.

&gt;CCMgr: What's up Slazer?

&gt;Me: Network has gone to hell in a hand basket and your only help is a 17 year old school kid.

&gt;CCMgr: Fair enough mate, carry on and God speed.

I get back to my desk and pop open wireshark to see what is causing so much network traffic.  Then the horror hits me, a broadcast storm, an unmanaged switched networks worse nightmare.  It could only happen if someone plugged the switches in wrong on the weekend, off to the server room I go.

I took a photo of the work they did and begun the process of tracing every cable, I also took the opportunity to take note of where all the cables went.  After about 20 min of tracing cables I discovered what happened. We had 5 switches, 4 ""access"" switches which the desktop systems connected to and 1 ""Core"" switch which the servers, phone system and internet connected to. It was in a star format.  What the IT contractors did without telling us was connect the switches in to ring formation but didn't disconnect the star or leave a break in the ring to prevent a broadcast storm.

I sent my report to OpsMgr and CorpMgr as to what transpired and requested an explanation from the IT contractors.  A conference call was scheduled for the following afternoon to get answers from the IT Contractors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The call consisted of Myself, OpsMgr, CorpMgr, ITCon1, ITCon2 and ITCon3.

[call intro]

&gt;OpsMgr: Can tell us step by step what you did on the weekend?

&gt;ITCon1: Sure, ITCon3 was there and I'll let him explain.

&gt;ITCon3: Well, we logged where all the switch ports connected into the patch panel.  Removed all the blue data cables and ran them again using the cable managers in the rack.

&gt;Me: What about the red, yellow, purple and green cables?

&gt;ITCon3: We only touched the blue cables, the green went to the phone points, we only saw one purple phone cable that went to your Cisco router, we couldn't see where the yellow ones went so we left them alone and we couldn't trace where the red cables went from the servers.

&gt;Me:  You mentioned you made a list of where all the switch ports connected to, can you send me that list now?

&gt;ITCon3: No worries, give me a few min.

The email comes in with a spreadsheet of our network.  I see the first problem, they only list 4 switches.

&gt;Me: Guys, you only list 4 switches.  Where is the 5th switch?

&gt;ITCon3:  You only have 4 switches. We also noticed you had no interconnects between your switches so we put them in a ring and let spanning tree block one of the ports.

&gt;Me:  *Thunk*

&gt;OpsMgr: I think you guys broke slazer, he just slammed his head on the table.

&gt;ITCon1: Well that's why you don't hire teenagers as IT guys, they don't know how the real IT world works.

&gt;OpsMgr: You may want to take that back, this teenager has the power to challenge your invoice.

&gt;Me: Now that I have had a moment to process the incompetence of ITCon3 last comment I will be not approving the invoice. Here are the reasons why.

&gt;1: We have 5 switches.

&gt;2: The yellow cables connect the 4 switches in the front of the rack to the switch at the back of the rack making our network a star format.

&gt;3: You made a loop in the network on the assumption our switches, that you sold us, are spanning tree capable.  They are not, we have unmanaged switches.

&gt;4: We were told the earliest you could have someone out here was Thursday, 4 days after reporting a full system outage on Monday.

&gt;5: Considering problems we have had with your staff in the past, I don't know why I expected this to go off without a hitch.

The 3 ITCon guys start talking among themselves and OpsMgr mutes our end.

&gt;OpsMgr: What other issues?

&gt;Me: When they claimed to spent and entire weekend rebuilding the SBS server. 

&gt;OpsMgr: Oh right. Did we pay that one?

&gt;CorpMgr: Don't think so.

CorpMgr unmutes the phone.

&gt;CorpMgr: I will be reviewing our contract with you and seeing if we have grounds for reimbursement for downtime caused by your staff.  Expect to hear from me in the next few days.

CorpMgr hangs up the call.

&gt;Me: How did these guys get the support contract to begin with?

&gt;OpsMgr: The old IT guy recommended them.

&gt;Me: ........ Oh well, time to catch up on work.

and the three of us left the conference room

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contract was cancelled the day I finished High School and started working full time.  Odd system issues stopped occurring once I changed all the passwords and locked out their maintenance account.

I don't know if we got reimbursed it wasn't my place to ask."
2ljptw,43,2014-11-06,"The Road I Never Traveled, Part 1",SadStoodUpBoy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ljptw/the_road_i_never_traveled_part_1/,"When I was a child, I used to have the same recurring dream.  I was on a long, paved road.  It was covered with cracks and crevices, like it hadn’t seen repair in many years.  A solid yellow line was barely visible in the center.  The tire marks left behind from screeching brakes were numerous, each one overlaid with a fresh one, always in the same place.  No matter what age I was when I dreamed it, I was always a toddler when I walked on this road.  My feet were bare and the asphalt burned them, but I didn’t care.  I had a sense of adventure inside of me.  The dream always ended the same.  A car came at me fast.  It hit the brakes as hard as it could.  Smoke erupted from the tires.  It never hit me though.  I always woke up before impact.

After each dream, I woke up in my bed, scared to death.  At first, my parents had to run into my room and check to make sure I was okay.  Eventually, they just put in a night light and told me they were nightmares.  They said I was too old to be scared by a silly thing like dreams.  As I got older, the dreams faded away.  They would still come from time to time, but they became less frequent.  I found myself forgetting about them as I got older.  The real world was scarier than the fog of night.  Things like getting accepted to college and finding a career became terrors of the real world, and I managed to overcome each of them until I considered myself moderately successful.  At age thirty, I was a manager at a Fortune 500 company, devoted to the interests of our clients, one case at a time.

The company I worked for conducted investigations for people who were too rich to sully their hands with trivial matters.  We specialized in everything from employee background checks to surveillance.  I got my start on the ground, trailing cheating spouses, insurance fraudsters and finding lost family members.  Eventually that led to a desk job where I did my investigations online.  I was fairly successful with my endeavors.  There wasn’t a case I couldn’t crack.  If the evidence existed, I could find it and wrap my fingers around it.  I went to school for software engineering, but the field was littered with others just like me.  My hobby as a photographer was what opened the door to the company, but my skills on the computer got me a leadership role.  In a cesspool of over the hill guys who hoped to turn the job into a career as a paparazzi and young women who hoped to stumble into someone like Channing Tatum, I stood out because I just wanted to work.

“Hey William!”  I was on my way to the coffee pot when Sam flagged me down.  She was one of the new interns.  She wasn’t special, I saw a dozen of them every year.

“It's Mr. Fields.  How can I help you?  Sam, was it?”  I knew her name, but she hadn’t earned the right to know that I knew it yet.  She certainly hadn't earned the right to call me by my first name.

“That’s right.  I just got a new case and I’m having a lot of trouble with it.”  She fluttered her eyelashes.  Was she really that stupid.  Half of the interns who walked in here thought they could show a little cleavage and land a permanent job.

“Can’t your supervisor help you?”  I paid people to deal with things like this.  My job was to make sure my supervisor team pushed every ounce of productivity out of people like Sam.  Interrupting my trip to the coffee pot wasn’t productive.

“She’s on vacation.”  Sam’s eyes turned to the empty cubicle normally occupied by the extra wide slab of human who cashed in her two week vacation and was currently on a cruise ship in the Bahamas.

“Ah that’s right.  Get George to help you.”  I dismissed her with a wave of my hand, aimed in the direction of another supervisor.  He was supposed to be the backup.

“Okay, thank you.”  Sam hopped, almost in a skip towards George.  I knew he would set her straight.

I filled my cup and went back to my office.  I would usually take it with a sugar and a cream, but Sam’s distraction had shaved two minutes off of my day and I didn’t have time.  I would just drink it black and blame every bitter sip on her.  She wouldn’t get the job she wanted.  She was already on the list of people I didn’t like.  If we weren’t short staffed already, I would have given her a cardboard box and had security walk her out.  We couldn’t afford that right now.  We had deadlines to meet, people who needed our services.  It was my job to make sure every client got the pristine work our company was known for and I would be damned if a bumbling intern kept me from it.

My phone rang.  The caller ID confirmed my suspicions.  It was my boss.

“Hey boss.”  I tried to act cheery.

“Are we on track for productivity today?”  His voice was gruff and sounded like a growl.

I scrambled to load the latest report.  I would normally have it set in real time on my computer, but I had let it time out while I went to get coffee.  Technically, I didn’t let it time out.  Sam caused it to time out because she distracted me from what should have been a thirty second trip.  I would have been back in plenty of time to refresh the report and when my boss called, I would have the answer ready for him.  Instead of being able to give him great news, I was struggling to get it set back up, a process that took longer than it should because we skimped on software in order to save money.

“Yeah we are-  Well.”  I wasn’t happy with what I saw.

“Don’t tell me we’re behind schedule!?”  It was a demand for the right answer, disguised as a question he would eviscerate me with if I gave the wrong answer.

“Not at all boss.  We’re on track.”  I lied.  It was a white lie though.  I would crack the whip and double up before the end of the day.

“Good!”  The phone clicked.

I created the own instrument of my destruction.  When I was still young and trying to get noticed, I built a software program that would monitor our progress in increments of time.  If we met the quotas, we would easily hit our targets and the cases would be done ahead of schedule.  Unfortunately, the software was built five years ago and a new operating system had rendered it slower than molasses.  I kept telling myself I was going to update it, but I never had the time.  I secretly hoped some other bright, young talent would do the work for me and use it to establish themselves.  None of them saw that opportunity, hence the reason I was in charge and they were still begging for a permanent position in the company.  It came with dental.  They should appreciate that enough to put in the extra time, but the Millennial generation didn’t see it that way.  They were all about what we could do for them, not what they could do for us.  I was having trouble adjusting to the new mentality.  Sometimes it felt like I was surrounded by aliens who landed on the planet yesterday.

The rest of my day was filled with high-end client schmoozing.  Most of them had permanent accounts with the company and called on us for trivial matters, but we were happy to oblige them because they paid well.  It got a little tedious setting up accounts to find their children’s lost puppies and making sure their wives were only getting tennis lessons when they went to the country club, but that was why we had interns.  As the sun set, I ordered some food from the only deli that delivered and polished off another cup of coffee along with a pastrami and provolone on rye.  Everyone in the office was clocking out for the day, but mine would continue for a few more hours.  I had reports to run and cases to review for accuracy.  There were things I didn’t trust even the best to handle.

When the last light went out, I dug into my drawer and pulled out a nice Cuban cigar.  They were a gift from a client who was happy he wasn’t going to spend the rest of his life paying alimony his fourth wife after she got railed by a poolboy.  The office was smoke free, as were all buildings in Atlanta, but the smell would be gone by the time our dreary eyed drones found their way to their desks the next morning.  I lit it and continued my work.  Every error pissed me off.  They were blemishes on my record, a reflection of poor customer service that I didn’t tolerate.  If the originators were still in the office, I would have them in my office for a nice screaming session.  Those always broke the tension nicely.

I smoked and the cloud formed an expression over my head which represented my growing anger.  If the sweet smell of child-labor tobacco wasn’t resonating from my mouth, I was certain my ears would be bellowing with a thicker cloud of rage.  I couldn’t believe how many problems were glaring back at me. I made note after note, firing off an angry email with each one.  There would be hell to pay in the morning.  I estimated at least an hour of wasted productivity would be spent correcting careless mistakes.  I remembered a time when people took pride in their work and wouldn’t dare leave the office with something so disgraceful left in a client’s file.  I needed a drink.  I risked a cigar after hours, but I wouldn’t dare risk a bottle.  That went beyond a policy and entered the realm of termination.  I put out my cigar and grabbed my coat.  I started to put it on, staring out at the city which was still bustling with life beneath my window.

“Mr. Fields?”  I almost jumped out of my coat when a light feminine voice started me.

“Sam?  What are you still doing here?”  I had no idea anyone was still in the office.  Nobody should still be in the office, we didn’t pay people overtime.

“I’m still working on that case.  I’m really having a lot of trouble with it.”  Her eyes were rimmed with redness and she looked gaunt in the illumination of the minimal lightning left behind after everyone else left for the day.

“I was just on my way out.  Go home.  You can work on it tomorrow.”  I would have words with George for not telling her the rules about overtime, although she technically just worked for experience, so she wasn’t hurting our budget.

“Could you just help me with something?  I swear I’ll go home right after that.”  She seemed very determined.

As tired as I was and as much as I really needed a drink before a few hours of sleep, I had to admire that dedication.  I couldn’t remember the last time I saw an intern stay in the office as late as me.  Even the desperate ones had parties and a social life.  Sam looked like she should have both lined up without any problems.  I couldn’t really deny someone a request for assistance, especially a subordinate.  I could pass them off to someone else if they were available, but my job description required me to step up when there wasn’t anyone else.  At least she wouldn’t be costing me productivity this time.

“Sure, show me what you have.”  I followed her back to her cubicle.  

Once I got to it, I saw why I didn’t realize she was still there.  Her cubicle was the one we called Siberia, because it was separated from the rest of the office by a pole.  She had turned her desk light off and was just working by the dismal incandescent glow of her monitor.  That probably explained why her eyes could use a dozen drops of Visine.  If she was pulled over on the way home, they would have a hard time believing it was just tiredness causing those bright red lines.  She moved her mouse across the screen and opened the electronic case file.  It was another program I designed, one that still functioned quite nicely even after all the system updates.

“This is the one I was asking you about this morning.  George tried to help, but he couldn’t figure it out.  I was going to move onto the next one, but they paid up front and I talked to them one the phone.  They sounded desperate.”  She moved her cursor over and showed me the balance on the account.

It was a decent sized budget for a first time account.  We didn’t always use the entire budget, but we contracted our services out on an estimation of time.  They must have thought it would require an investment in time and resources if they put that kind of money down.  I scanned the file as she guided me through it.  Everything looked pretty standard.  It was a family trying to figure out what happened to their child.  That wasn’t unusual.  We got a few cases like this every month.  Most of the time they just turned out to be runaways or relative-based kidnappings.  All that we normally did was figure out some leads and send the cops to pick them up.

“So what’s the problem?”  I really didn’t see anything that would require additional work.  This might require one person on the ground and some phone calls, but nothing more.

“Check out the date.”  She moved to the front page of the case.  I tilted my head and squinted, then opened my eyes in a little bit of shock when I saw it.  This happened twenty-five years ago.

“They’re a little late to be asking for help…”  We occasionally got desperate endeavors, but rarely one this old.

“That is what I thought too, but look. The boy was five years old when he disappeared.”  She showed me the mother’s statement.  It read like most pleas for help.

“A five year old boy who disappeared twenty five years ago.  Not much to go on.  Do they think he was kidnapped?  I’m sure he’s dead by now.”  I shrugged my shoulders.  It was hard to have much compassion in my line of work.

“They thought enough to pay us up front to investigate it.”  Sam’s sassy mood wasn’t appreciated.  I needed a drink right now, not a leap to conclusions.

“Yeah, I guess.  Email me the information.  I’ll call the mother tomorrow and let her know we can’t do much with this.  I hate to turn down money, but this is a waste of our time.”  I threw my laptop bag over my shoulder and reached to shut her monitor off.

“Okay, it’s just…”  She still seemed perplexed.  Interns had trouble letting go, especially when they got their first big dollar case.  I understood her hesitation but we needed her focused on cases we could solve.  We didn’t get paid if there were no results.

“What?  Spit it out.  I’m tired and I’m ready to go home.”  I didn’t like suspense.  She needed to tell me what was on her mind so I could tell her she was wrong.

“I can’t find any mention of this case in the police files, and I can’t find any articles about it.”  Our system tied into multiple archives.  We paid well for the service, but it solved half of our cases with a few keystrokes.

“It’s an old case.”  I dismissed her research.

“I guess so.”  She flipped through a few more pages before I could flip it off.  Something caught my attention.

“Wait.  Go back.”  I sat my laptop bag down.  I had only caught a glimpse of it, but something caused a chill to shoot straight through my body.

“Okay.”  She did as I asked, flipping back to a picture.  It was a screenshot she had taken from Google Maps.  It looked familiar.

“Pull this up, I need to see the area.”  I knelt down so I could get a better look.

She loaded a web browser and went to the address on Google Maps.  At first, it focused on a house.  The picture was less than a year old according to the date stamped on it.  The grass needed to be cut and the mailbox looked like it hadn’t been replaced in years.  I grabbed the mouse from her and spun it around, looking at the area.  I moved the Google Maps avatar one step and then I knew exactly why I recognized the area.  It was the street from my dreams, the one I had time and time again.  There was no mistaking it. I felt like I had been there a hundred times.

“Where is this?”  I spun the camera around a few more times.

“It’s uh… Thomasville.”  She pointed at the address on top of the map.  

I had heard of the city, but only in passing.  It was a small town somewhere south of Atlanta.  I was enthralled by the image as it unfolded on the screen.  I felt like I had walked that road as much as I had walked the roads in Marietta, where I grew up.  I had never stopped to consider that the road might be a real place.  I just thought it was some street I conjured up in my imagination, a road I created with bits and pieces of roads I had been on when I was younger.  I was certain I had never been to Thomasville.  Even our family vacations to Florida never brought us to a stopping place other than a gas station or our destination.

“Sam.”  I finally spoke after a brief silence.  “Send the details of this case to my e-mail.” I gathered my laptop up and shook my head for a second.

“Is everything okay?  Did I do something wrong?”  I wasn’t looking back at her as I headed to the elevators, but I could hear the fear in her voice.  She probably thought she made a terrible blunder and her badge wouldn’t work when she tried to pass through security the next day.

I didn’t give her an answer.  I was lost in my own thoughts.  How was this possible?  I dreamed that place up, I didn’t visit it.  I knew for a fact I would remember somewhere like that.  I had relayed the story to my parents a lot as a child, even describing the color of the grass, the old mailbox, and the street.  They never once gave any inclination it was a place I could have visited.  They just looked at each other like I had lost my mind or something.  Something was very wrong with what I saw, and I couldn’t explain it.  I needed that drink, I probably needed a few of them.  That was a road I never traveled."
2ljsh0,2,2014-11-06,Unsure about path. Anyone who can advice who may have gone through relocation?,IllIIllIII,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2ljsh0/unsure_about_path_anyone_who_can_advice_who_may/,"Hello everyone!

I have a problem with choosing what I want to do. I currently have 3 options that I can pursue (all are engineering jobs):

1) A small company that is growing really fast. Hourly pay but essentially salary benefits (Not sure about how number compares). It is a tech job but not super difficult.

2) Currently trying to get a job at a really big tech company; currently in the interview process. Most likely salary but really good benefits. I would have to relocate so that is an issue.

3) Working at another big company which I interned at. Same as above but might not have to relocate. Intern pay was great so I am assuming full time will be great as well. The norm I saw were long hours and is mentally exhausting.

My parents do not want me to work hourly due to status symbol (Asian parents) and they think I won't get the same benefits. I am leaning towards the first option because the pay is decent and work is stress free for the most part. Also because the company is expanding so fast, I feel like I am getting a head start since I am joining when it is still at its growing stage which the other two company are not. I fear that relocation would be too rough, personally and socially, so I want to avoid that. 

Anyone personally gone through relocation can give me any insight? Was it worth the move? Anyone turned down a big company or a smaller one?"

All I want to do in my free time is lie down and watch the same tv shows I've downloaded and seen a dozen times a piece already while going to different apps on my phones and waiting till I can eat again. I am constantly delaying all the problems and obstacles that are in my life at a time when I'm meant to make a lot of heavy choices.

I do my best to keep my appearance acceptable but it seems like basic hygiene is as much as I can do. Don't really know what will come of this but thought I should post since it could lead to me feeling better and it sounds like I am typing and actually doing work at my internship, a place where I have been mostly browsing the internet mindlessly, taking excessive bathroom and lunch breaks, waiting until 5 pm. When I walk in the office, I just get lost in the wide open internet, browsing all things that semi-intersest me, and putting off actual work assignments that I've been given ages ago.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but a lot of floating emotions are clouding the way I know I should or could be acting and succeeding. I would hate to let the people in my life that do care about me feel so terrible by wishing they could have done more for me, so I know it's not an option. A quick end won't absolve me from pain but recently been a lousy option that appears in my head as I walk through traffic.

I want to do more meditation to help, more ukulele playing, more socializing and exercising to pull me back out of this. My pattern recently has been have one or two productive, social days followed by one or more indulgent, lethargy-filled awful ones which seem to do more incremental damage than the positive days do good. And the thing is even though I know it's bad for future me, all I care about is appeasing the me that's here and now who wants no strife and all things lazy. It's a painful cycle that I don't know if I should be feeling bad about. I think the only solution is to not feel bad, not indulge, and get on with life with more positivity. Is that it?

Do i need to vocalize more? Write more? Create more? Self-deprecate less?

Yeesh."

I am really confused and I have the feeling that I don't see things as they really are. I need an outsider point of view. Be honest and tell me what is the right thing to do. I will try to be as short as possible. I had a relationship with this girl for 4 years. The past year wasn't all great but we managed to make it work. The main problem was I wasn't paying so much attention to her because of work and other stuff. She decided to go for an internship in another country for two months. We agreed that I will also come for 1 week cause I really wanted to visit that country. After the first month she went there we broke up. It was mutual. But I still went to visit her as a friend. Then I found out she had a ""thing"" going on with other guy even before we broke up and she didn't tell me. I found out by myself. While I was there she kept texting and going out with him even in front of me. She was different person. My week was terrible cause I had to see them two all the time and she didn't care. My week there was over and I got back home but she stayed there for 2 more weeks.
After I came home I was devastated and broken but I moved out from the place we lived together and tried to move on as hard as I could. Some days ago she came back and we met. We talked, she told me they kissed, she told me she really just had fun with him and that she regrets it. We had sex two times and now she is again the same person like before - she cares for me and so on but I feel really hurt and we both know we can't be together anymore. Only the sex is great.
She behaved really disrespectful for not telling me and being with this guy in front of me and kissing him after I left. What would you do if you were me ? We can't be together but we have feelings for each other - probably I have more than her. I feel like I am a complete fool and being used. Having sex from time to time sounds good but it won't lead to anything good.... I am so confused .... any help would be appreciated.. Thanks....
tl;dr: How should I proceed... ? Ignore her ? Try to be friends ? Just have fun (sex) with her ? Try to move on ? Thanks.."

My major is Computer Science and one of my minors is Mobile Software Technology (essentially Android development). I'll be graduating with a 4.0 GPA and I've had two internships, one in a Software Engineer position and one in a Mobile Software Developer position.

2llajj,2,2014-11-07,[For Hire] Computer science student with intermediate Microsoft Excel skills,[deleted],NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/2llajj/for_hire_computer_science_student_with/,"Hello,

I'm currently a freshmen studying computer science major at one of CUNY's community college. I'm currently looking for a position (internship, full-time, or part-time) during business hours to gain experience in the FinTech or technology industry.

My most recent experience has been a 6-month internship with Casey Family Programs' investment team, located at 7 World Trade Center. Casey Family Programs is a non-profit aimed to eliminate the need for foster care by attacking the root causes for that need. Their investments team is responsible for handling $2 Billion+ and achieving a return large enough to cover the company's expenses over the long run.

At their NY office, I was in charge of creating audit books, and restructuring their private equity and real estate reports, which I did so successfully by implementing a database system and automating most of the report, reducing the reporting time from ~5 hours to ~45 minutes. They seemed pretty happy about that.

I achieved this by learning a bit of VBA, getting familiar with the inner workings of Microsoft Excel, and applying the knowledge.

I'm just starting out on my degree, so I don't have a lot of programming experience aside from VBA, but I'm willing to learn.

If you or anyone you know of has an opportunity for me, please feel free to PM me for my resume. Thanks!

Also, if you're curious about anything, please don't hesitate to ask.

Right now, I'm looking for internships, but I'm wondering if I should start focusing on building my own projects first (like creating a website for someone, etc). I tried to apply for other web dev/software internships, but I think they wanted someone with better experience. They said they liked my attitude and had potential, but I just lacked experience. I got a call to build websites via wordpress (and i'm thinking this is a good opportunity for me to start my own project and list it on my resume), but would it just be better to get an internship?

I've seen example cover letters/resumes on the internet for engineering internships and they all write about how much projects they did and how they had previous internships where they did important work and acquired technical skills. 

Problem is, I've had one internship so far and I've done mostly stereotypical ""intern work"" there so I don't have much to write about it.

Second I go to a community college and there isn't much opportunities for me to do projects. The school barely has the funding to purchase computers that are less than 10 years old. There is a robotics club, and I joined it,  but no one ever shows up to the club.

I know I probably sound like a little bitch making excuses, but I really don't know what to do.  What did you guys do to get a good internship? Do you think being in a community college diminishes my opportunities for internships?"

Need visa but this can take several weeks. My employer replies very slowly, but time is nearing and I fear I might not get a visa in time. Need to politely tell him to hurry up, but afraid this might cost me this opportunity.

---

**Full story**

I'm a university student doing my internship next year. School allows us to go abroad, and there is a country I have always dreamed of visiting, so I decided to go there for my internship.

I started preparing for this *really* early: almost an entire year ago. After submitting my CV/motivation to a dozen of companies specifically looking for international interns, I was ignored by all of them. Finally, I found someone through Reddit working in this country that told me his company was also doing internships and I should check them out.

My online contact did me a big favor then. He sent my files straight to the director of the branch I would be working in, and I *immediately* received a positive reply, asking me to do some tests and hold an interview.

Everything went fine, my results were good and the interview was a success. But then a misunderstanding occurred: they thought I would be doing my internship this year (even though my files explicitly said next year), so the minute they found out it was still going to be a year until my internship, all communication seized.

I kept messaging my online friend, but even he seemed to ignore me. Finally, after months, he replied, apologizing for his lack or replies due to personal problems and explaining it was still too early for the company and I should wait a little longer.

Now, two months ago, I messaged him again, and finally got in direct touch with the director of my branch. I got a contract, that is to say, one that I had to sign, but have yet to receive their counter-signed version (this has been two weeks now). I explained to him I need settle my visa soon now, because time is running out, and I need their signature to be 100% sure this internship is actually going to happen. I know they told me I was welcome there, but I don't trust it as long as I don't get their signature.

Important detail is that in order to get my visa, I need the company to submit a special paper to their local government. This procedure can take up to two months, and my internship starts in February. That means if I do not get them to submit the request for this paper by the end of this month, there is a chance I will not get my visa in time, rendering all my efforts completely useless.

I sent him a mail last week, telling him any updates would be very much appreciated, but have yet to hear back from them. They say they are restructuring at the moment, so they've been very busy, but I also want them to understand that time is running out and I need guarantees.

How would I go about asking them to hurry up? This is my first experience with a big company, and I'm afraid to mess up and lose this. Thanks for the help."

[Tell us more about your book of essays! What are some of the themes that you write on? (And I liked you a lot in ABCD. You were the only character that wasn't a whiny baby\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lll3m/i_am_aasif_mandvi_best_known_as_a_correspondent/clvxbib?context=5)|Lol.. thanks, i guess... the book is a series of personal essays, they are humerous for the most part, but they do touch upon themes of the immigrant identity, dislocation, race, trying to find an identity in a western world as a south asian, being muslim in america post 9/11, but don't worry, it also touches on some sereious themes, like my fathers obsession with brunch and why my parents bonded over their love of Urine... true story!
[Desis are obsessed with bodily functions. And brunch. I'll definitely look up the book. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lll3m/i_am_aasif_mandvi_best_known_as_a_correspondent/clvya70?context=5)|Yes they are!!! gotta love it! thanks. 
[Hello Aasif Thanks for ama session!  What s the best advice u ve ever been given in ur career? By who?  What s ur most incredible experience of life?

[1\) what was the most influential/formative event in your life?  2\) have you ever considered making a spin off like John Oliver?  Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lll3m/i_am_aasif_mandvi_best_known_as_a_correspondent/clvx1ap?context=5)|Hmm... it was probably the moment I got on stage as a young boy and felt the thrill of performing... also the first time i tasted peanut butter! performing and peanut butter have remained the two great loves of my life.  i am concentrating on being an actor right now, with the new HBO show called The Brink comoing out next year.  
[Hi Aasif! Huge fan! Saw you in Disgraced when it was playing at the Lincoln Center last year. Curious about how you were picked to star in it (you were fantastic in it BTW!\) and why aren't in the Broadway adaptation thats running now?  And have you seen the Broadway version yet? If so, what do you think? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lll3m/i_am_aasif_mandvi_best_known_as_a_correspondent/clvxfja?context=5)|Thank you. i was picked for that role by the playwright ayad akhtar who had me come in over the course of several years and do workshops of the play and help develop the role. i have not seen the bway prd yet but plan to. i was very sad at not doing it on bway but unfortunately i was commited to shooting a new HBO series called The Brink and so the schedules could not work out.

What's it about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lll3m/i_am_aasif_mandvi_best_known_as_a_correspondent/clvxqdx?context=5)|Its a geopolitical comedy, each season we follow in real time a global crisis playing out. we see it through the eyes of the state dept, the military and the foreign service. it's dr strangelove meets mash.

[Do you actually think the current PM of India Narendra Modi should be held accountable and punished for the Gujrat riots? (even though all courts in India have cleared him\)  Also, why all ""Indian's and Indian police should be ashamed of themselves for this kind of behaviour.""

[Thanks for answering. I think we should understand politics in general, is nasty, independent of what region it might belong to. Also, if we cannot trust the judiciary, who do we trust.

[Last year you had a plum role in **The Internship**, a film which had a lot of potential to be a sly commentary on technology and today's new youth market.

Basically I have been trying my hand at internships, but no luck. But my GPA is not nearly high enough for any internships with companies I want to work for. 

I'm just looking to see if anyone has decent stories of working for a major like Shell, BP, Chevron with a low GPA?

[You're amazing, Dan! Thanks for doing this! I recently read where you said the best advice you ever got was to do what would change you and improve you the most. What's the most valuable piece of advice you think you can give, or, alternatively, what's the second best piece of advice you've gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw9w3r?context=5)|Here is something from my last column in the WSJ --
 |Dear Dan,
 |Many years ago, I was badly burned, and since then, I carry many visible scars. Recently, at a Halloween party, somebody pointed to the scars on my face and told me what a wonderful costume I had. I tried to correct her and explained that I was really very badly burned, but she burst out laughing.
 |At this point, I had two choices: make her feel guilty or let it go. What should I have done? I must admit that it colored the Halloween party for me, and I no longer felt like I belonged.
 |—Dan (Ariely)
 |You should have let it go. The person pointing out your scars clearly had only good intentions, and trying to correct her once was sufficient. This was probably one of hundreds of comments that she made during the party, and while her remark was central for you, if you asked her in 48 hours about her memories from the party, she probably wouldn’t even remember you, your scars or her comment. You had already stopped enjoying the party after her comment; my guess is that having made her feel bad about her remark would only have intensified your negative feelings.
 |P.S. One more lesson from this unfortunate episode: Sometimes, putting yourself in the position of an external advisor and asking yourself what advice you’d give to someone else in the same situation can be a useful way to reason more calmly and make better decisions. Good luck using this approach next time.
[Just DL-ed the app after watching your video on Perils of Procrastination. I'm very guilty of it. What are you tips on avoiding this? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8g5o?context=5)|Procrastination plagues us all, so you're not alone. There are lots of ways to think about it, but one recent interesting study emailed parents to let them know that their kids were facing a deadline or an upcoming exam.
 |By simply emailing them, creating an implicit social pressure and probably some explicit social pressure, the tasks were completed at a higher rate.
 |On top of that, because you don't have any immediate reward for completing the task, I'd recommend looking for one. You can look for positive rewards (praise or a good reputation) or you can think of ""negative rewards"" such as shame or humiliation.
 |For next year, think about the idea of ""precommitment."" With precommitment, you approach students at the beginning of the semester and you tell them to put $10 down. You tell them if they miss the deadline they will lose the money, and if they hit the deadline they will get the money back. This helps the students create a system of motivation for themselves. We've tested it numerous and it's proven to be very effective.  
[, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to listen to my product idea a few months ago. Your comments and questions were insightful and inspired me to go deeper into the idea. I'll let you know if I get funding for the project.  In my experience, recognizing, acknowledging, and evaluating the instances in which I am irrational helps me to buck that irrational behavior. Do you think there is category / type of irrational behavior, though,  that isn't helped by recognizing,  acknowledging, and evaluating it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw98fn?context=5)|Think of two extreme categories (and of course there many in the middle). One is big purchases - something we do very rarely that is not urgent. Things like buying a house, a car, getting married, going for a grad degree. These are instances in which understanding our biases can allow us to overcome them. You can simply sit down, think about it, realize where the mistakes are, and try to overcome them.  For example, you might be infatuated with somebody - thinking to yourself that it's going to last a long time. But if you ask your mother what she thinks, your mother is unlikely to take your short term perspective into account. She will think about the long term and might give you solid advice.  On the other hand, if you think about something like attention, or distractions from email and notifications, it's something that happens in the moment. It's very hard to not get distracted by knowing that you have email waiting for you, for example.  Of course you could take email notifications and just turn them off, but that puts you back in the first category of thinking about something for a long time and then overriding the mistakes in principle (but not at the moment).
[What are some of the major lessons or insights from your field that you think could apply to approaching  inter nation conflicts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8u2m?context=5)|I think one of the things we show is the extent to which people experience the reality they expect to experience.
 |As every sports fan knows, if the referee makes a call that goes against your team, you can't help but think of the referee as blind, stupid, evil, malicious. And this is because our motivation colors our experience. We don't experience reality in an objective way, we experience it in a way that is distorted by our motivation.
 |This of course is very sad for international conflict, because it means that the chance that people from two different sides will sit and agree on the facts is very low. But it does suggest that we need interventions from objective third parties. Sadly, the world is such right now that there are not many unbiased third parties [the UN could have been one]. But I think we need to build those reliable, accountable, objective third parties if we hope to bridge some of the deeper conflicts around the world. 
[What are the most important characteristics of an individual that are prerequisites for good habit forming? Alternatively, will you be doing studies on the effectiveness of your new app?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8nwn?context=5)|Yes, we're going to study inside and outside of the app.  Outside, to bring learning about peoples' behaviors to influence what we do in the application.  And inside, in aggregate to protect privacy, but to ensure that we are helping people live happy, productive and well-balanced lives.
 |So far, we've found that when we make suggestions about how to use your time, people are 150% more likely to act upon them than if people have to motivate themselves to remember and note the items.
 |This relates to habits, because people are not innately wired to take on and follow through with habits because ""tomorrow is that magical day when everything can get done"" and habits are most likely to be pushed off.  If we are suggesting and putting habits in the environment of the person, we can help them keep good habit behaviors.
 |So the things we're finding is habits are about being reminded and committing to time, which is what Timeful is all about.
[What does a behavioral officer do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw7w3k?context=5)|It is a very good question, but the truth is that I don't want to tell anyone because then they will be able to hold me accountable to it.
 |Seriously (more seriously) one of the main challanges with thinking about time is the psychology of time and the mistakes we make when we make decisions about time (procrastination, wasting our most productive hours on non productive tasks, etc).  My job as a behavioral officer is to figure out the mistakes people make, and the ways to overcome some of our personal biases.
 |It is a fun job, and it doesn't seem that I am going to run out of mistakes to look at any time soon ;)
[Dan! Loved Predictably Irrational! As a young marketing manager it has been an absolutely incredible resource in having a better understanding as to why we make the decisions we make.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8kh3?context=5)|I also find this incredibly optimistic because it means if we change the environment in which people operate, we can drive better behaviors.""
[Out of all the experiments you have conducted, which was your favorite, and which had the most surprising results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw8kh3?context=5)|The reason i think it worked so well was that we changed the environment in which they lived. We created a tangible representation of their savings and changed the discussion in the household.
[Hi Dan, I love your work.  I seem to continually suffer (or possibly be fueled by\) the notion that the grass is always greener on the other side.  Sometimes i think its a curse -- i never seem to appreciate the moment.  Other times i think its a great motivator to keep on striving for improvement.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw86md?context=5)|Let me use relationships as a metaphor for my answer. I think that looking constantly at other couples and other people and comparing yourself to them is certainly not a good way to find happiness. It is a way to maximize counterfactual thinking (thinking about what could have been).
 |On the other hand, looking at your own partner and focusing on the kinds of things you admire in them and the kinds of things they inspire you to strive to be better at is an incredibly motivating way of living and trying to improve.
 |In essence, I think that comparing yourself to outsiders in a negative light (downward comparison) can be damaging, but comparing yourself to people who are close to you in a positive way can be very beneficial. 
[Hi Dan! I love your books. You always have a good topic for a dinner table.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw81vw?context=5)|Recently, we finished a study in a slum in Kenya where we tried to get very poor people to save a bit of money. We gave some people financial incentives, some social pressure - but the thing that worked the best was creating a physical coin that represented their savings.  That coin more than doubled their savings as compared to a 20% match. The reason i think it worked so well was that we changed the environment in which they lived. We created a tangible representation of their savings and changed the discussion in the household. I also find this incredibly optimistic because it means if we change the environment in which people operate, we can drive better behaviors.
[In all of the studies you've conducted, what is the most outstanding fact you've come across that has constantly surprised you and gone against what you thought would happen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw81vw?context=5)| 
[I've been following your work for a very long time, you're awesome -- made all my interns read 'predictable irrationality' as their first assignment. So, thank you!  What would you say is/are the most basic motivational factors in humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lmp1k/im_dan_ariely_duke_professor_of_behavioral/clw89v3?context=5)|Maybe the most basic part of us that forces us to make mistakes is our emotions. Emotions are nature's way of executing a command. Imagine you're in the jungle and you see a tiger. What nature wants you to do is run as fast as possible without thinking.

2lnchi,4,2014-11-07,"Is it common to feel like you have few true friends in ""adult"" life?",sailboatsairplanes,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2lnchi/is_it_common_to_feel_like_you_have_few_true/,"So my title may not be a very good description but here's what I'm getting at.

After college and even the last year or two of college, I started to feel like I had very few true friends. I really just concentrated on getting experience interning, so most of the time it felt like I was working full time while taking classes. I took pride in excelling career wise and really put a lot of my energy climbing the ""internship ladder.""

I have two best friends that I've known since middle school, but we all live in different states and only see each other every so often. I have a few friends from college, but interactions really don't go pass maybe meeting up for dinner once in a blue moon or texting some. I'm very easy to push away people who I don't believe are genuine. I've had friends who, if I make plans with them, often cancel on me and also never take the initiative to invite me to hang out. When this happens, I drop them completely. If they don't want to hang, I won't ask them to. I've always been a believer that there's no point in having friends who aren't actually there for you or being a true friend. Someone I can go to if anything is on my mind for example, instead of someone who just wants to have fun.

My roommate and I were fairly close before, but I feel like we've grown apart and spend more time being roommates than friends. She still lives a different lifestyle than I do. Most of my network are people who are still in college and like to go out and party. I'm honestly super boring; I work a 9-5 job, chill at home and I'm not really a fan of going out. Some weekends I'll drive to my hometown to spend time with family.

I just got a job this summer, and although my coworkers are nice, everyone in my office is at least 20 years older than me.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1.5 years, but our relationship for the most part has been long distance and he's deployed right now. I've heard of people who basically have their SO, and that's it. How common is that? 

I'm just in one of those moods where I feel a little lonely and I want to know if I'm just the antisocial weird one or if other people have these issues too. 

TL;DR - Is it uncommon to feel like you have few true friends post college? Is this how your twenties are?"
2lnis4,13,2014-11-08,"Graduated college in May, Can't find a job.",Humdinger222,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2lnis4/graduated_college_in_may_cant_find_a_job/,"Hello everyone,

So I graduated from a decent state school back in May with a Finance degree and a 3.0 GPA. Since then I've been applying to jobs as often as they come up on indeed, monster, and careerbuilder, among others, but I'm barely getting interviews.

I've had my resume reviewed by my school numerous times, my peers, and my parents and all said it looks great, and they don't see any issues. 

I have internship experience, and leadership experience (Helped found a club of around 30 members). I was also in a ""Faculty Approval Only"" course that only accepts 10 undergrads a semester. 

The jobs I'm applying to are Financial Analyst, Risk Analyst, and Credit Analyst type jobs, but out of the 70 jobs I've applied to in the last month and a half, I've had about 3 or 4 interviews. A week after I apply I call and ""check on my application."" Typically I get sent to some HR persons voicemail and never hear back.

The interviews I do have are typically 45 minutes long, and in person, and I feel like they go very well, but never hear back. Interviewers will say ""If you have any more questions, please email me."" So I will send a follow up email after about 3 days thanking them for their time, and recapping what we spoke about. I try to include a question, but I've yet to have an interviewer reply with an answer. One interviewer said in the interview that she would show me a report the previous person in the position wrote so I could see, so I asked to see that in the follow up email, but never heard back. 

I've tried reaching out to my professors in the Finance department, but they have ignored my emails. I had a friend ask one of the professors (that professor is terrible with email), and the professor told my friend that he saw the email, but didn't know what to say to me. 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do now, and it's really starting to weigh on me. Though I'm fortunate enough to have some cash, and am able to live with my parents in a large city.

I feel like I'm starting to get to that point where my unemployment hurts my chances of employment.

What am I doing wrong here? "
2lnjab,0,2014-11-08,TIFU by committing a violent crime (misdemeanor),[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lnjab/tifu_by_committing_a_violent_crime_misdemeanor/,"I'm 30. Before I start with the story, I should mention an oddity about myself. I may have Hyperacusis (hypersensitive hearing) or something. Ever since I can remember, I've always had a *very* difficult time handling certain sounds. An incessantly beeping phone or microwave can practically ruin my day. I've nearly broken down crying before because of electronic noises that I cannot silence for whatever reason. Five car door beeps is too much. It's not usually anger that I feel, it's more like I'm being tortured.

I know I should get this checked out, but I didn't really think about how it was affecting my life until last few years, and I don't have the money to do it until I get a job.

**The Story**

My wife and I have 3 kids. We both used to work, but I was laid off during the recession and used it as an opportunity to get a degree in what I've always been interested in (Computer Science). Halfway through, she was laid off too. Fast forward 5 years, and somehow we made it through my maxing out loans, credit cards, and a bit of family help.

Before college, I was really stuck (but making good money) in a field of expertise that I wasn't interested in. So I made sure that, even though I only went to a state university, my resume would be excellent. I have a high GPA, in some honor societies, taught several full classes, headed the tutoring department, was the president of the club, had a great internship, several good projects up on github, and I was probably one of the top 10 students in the department, skill-wise, etc.  I did absolutely everything I could to make myself as marketable as possible.

Having all that debt and very little income has paid it's toll. This last year has been hard, as what little income and credit we had is basically gone. We're not delinquent on anything, but we're struggling to keep it that way.

I became depressed. My relationship with my wife had never been stellar to begin with, but it had been getting better until this last year. I found myself lying in bed a lot, and not really helping with the kids and things around the house as much as I should. She was fed up, and I can't blame her.

Early-ish one morning, she was very upset that I was going to spend another day lying around depressed. She wanted to argue. I wasn't upset, heck I didn't even say much, but I definitely injected little comments that I shouldn't have. Anyways, she has a very strong tendency to keep an argument going for hours, while I usually just want to drop it.

It was about 10:30 or 11AM, and I was still in bed, and she was *still* railing me for lying around. Then she started *screaming* at the top of her lungs at me, and pounding the bed that I was on. I have to say, that I was not all that mad. I just couldn't handle the screaming, like I can't handle many high pitch noises. This is the part where I fucked up (the most?). It was just for a moment, and I didn't injure her, but I choked her. Oh I know I fucked up big time, I'm not trying to downplay my actions. I simply want to highlight how so many things were destroyed in basically an instant. I was arrested, charged with a misdemeanor, pled guilty, and I'm now in counseling. That was 3 months ago.

Neither of us want to break up our family, and we both know that a lot of our problems arise from all the financial stress and other things that are only temporary. So we're going to marriage counseling as soon as I we the money (read: a job), and I'll go to a doctor, etc. She started seeing a counselor. In my opinion, our marriage is going to be fine, and I think she believes that too. In fact, we hope it will improve significantly, as now we're making a more active effort.

It's been 3 months now. But a lot of damage has been done. For one, she told my entire family. Having them all know what I did has been really humiliating. It's like nothing I've achieved or accomplished even matters, because I'm An Abuser^TM

What's been bothering me the most lately, and what inspired me to write this post, is the effect this is having on my was-just-about-to-start career. I found a killer job, the kind I pushed myself doing everything in my power for 5 years for, the kind I put my family through hell to get. They made me an offer, which I accepted, but I have to go through a security check to obtain clearance. This means that all these people I just got through trying to impress now get to hear about what a piece of shit I am. It's only a misdemeanor, but it was just 3 months ago. I haven't finished my counseling yet, and I'm on probation for 3 years. So now I'm waiting, and hoping that my clearance is granted so that we can get a fresh start on the next part of our lives.

Only, I don't really believe that is going to happen. I'm sure my clearance will be denied any day now. I was even more depressed after the fight than I was before. And then there's this... if I don't get this job, I'm not sure how many fucks I have left to give.


**TL;DR**  I may have Hyperacusis (hypersensitive hearing), as I have a *very* hard time handling certain sounds. Depressed right after graduation and staying in bed a lot. Wife got very frustrated, we argued, she started screaming at me, I put her in a choke hold. I let go right away, but it was too late, and I was arrested. Wife and I are seeking help, and will probably be fine now. My entire family assumes I am a serial abuser and has lost respect for me, and I may not be able to get security clearance to get an excellent job we really needed."

2lnq66,16,2014-11-08,How do people usually work together in software?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lnq66/how_do_people_usually_work_together_in_software/,"I'm a student with minimal work (intern) experience. I'm trying to figure out how the industry operates and what I should expect. Writing this from mobile so bear with me...

Early on when programming with people from class, I would really like the idea of working together on a single program to solve problems. It seemed better an every way than working separately. Instead of the communication overhead of having to explain to someone the problem, we would already be on the same page. Pair programming seemed to me the best way to work with code. You can catch bugs that other people miss and vice versa, discuss things as they come up etc.

Then I met people who didn't want to do that. They were rather innately opposed to the idea of doing this, and would prefer to do their portion of the work on their own. More than this, they preferred email/IM communication rather than discussing problems with voice. 

This all seemed very inefficient to me. I felt like every time I has to explain something it required a tremendous amount of effort to articulate and comprehend the back and forth. If we were together when we wrote this we wouldn't even be discussing what the problem is and I could direct you with my hand to the problem area of the code. I felt it was massively inefficient, especially as complexity increased.

I watched a documentary on Linus Torvalds and found out he uses email to discuss the Linux kernel's development. That sounds like utter hell to me. Every time I'm typing out words I feel frustrated.

For pair programming to work well I guess both parties would have to be at a similar skill level. For me, I don't mind bringing the other people up to speed with what I'm working on if we're of comparable skill level. I guess I have this sort of naive optimism about pair programming though, and in reality it probably doesn't go down that well. Or perhaps people had the wrong notion of what I wanted to do. Perhaps they thought it was inefficient or that I was holding them back.

So I guess I'm just wondering: what are the common practices in the industry and how is it working for you?
What would be ideal in your opinion and (this is the crux of this post) where should I work if I like one style more than the others?"

4) Get involved deeply with a design team and one engineering organization as well as one non engineering organization. This is complete. I have one leadership role out of the three and intend to increase it to two by next year (first years are not eligible for many things).

2losd3,0,2014-11-08,Stuck on which 4 of these colleges i should go to,99throw9away,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2losd3/stuck_on_which_4_of_these_colleges_i_should_go_to/,"I'm an 18 year old senior (male) from Southern California.

I plan on majoring in something business related. It's probably going to be either Business Marketing or Business Administration. I'd like to work in the movie industry (business part of it) but still be close to all the cool stuff. Was originally going to major in film or something in the arts category but figured it was too risky and people always complain once they have it and can't get a job. I know these types of jobs are super competitive, but i'd probably try to start out with a non paying internship just to meet people on the inside and work my way up, ya know? 

 I've applied to multiple places that I haven't heard back from yet, but I got my acceptance letters from 4 of the schools I was looking at mostly.

Chico State - Basically an unranked school (really big party school..in california = less $...seems like a blast though and i have a lot of friends that go there &amp; I'd probably end up going with a few of my high school buds too.) 

Washington State -  a pretty dang big school out of state(lots o $). From what I heard it's a party school(which is nice), it'd be a change of weather (which i sorta want)...apart of the Pac-12 and is super spirited (I love being spirited..hate schools that don't give a shit about themselves)...There mascot is the same as my High school mascot, so that's cool. Heard they have a good Business School.

Oregon State - Out of state = more $ i have to give. Change of weather (not as much as WSU)...I think they're apart of pac 12. They're the beavers, which is pretty lame but they're pretty spirited. Not sure about their business school. My second cousin goes there and loves it..but she's apart of a sorority and i'm not really interested in joining a fraternity (I'd still like to party wherever I end up going though). 

Arizona State - I'm sure a lot of you even on the east side know about this school. Easy to get into, huge population. 8,000 enrolled freshman a year. Big party school, would probably meet a lot of new people and destined to find people just like me since it's so big...Pretty sure the dorms are on the outside so i'd imagine it hard to make friends since you can't really always keep your dorm door open since outside would make your room hot af, and from what i've heard keeping your dorm door open is the key to making friends in the beginning. Tons of clubs, etc. Pretty sure I heard some good things about their business school. 

Do any of you know about these colleges? If you go to them, what do you love/hate about them? Any insight? If i go OOS is it going to be hard getting internships back in socal or will I only get scholarships in those states, etc? I want to live in Cali but moving quite a bit away for college would be amazing. "

The offer I have from KPMG involves doing non-client facing work on engagements. I will be able to rotate through several different practice areas through the course of the program.

The PwC offer is for an internal rotational program. I would be working in areas like marketing, HR, or recruitment.

The third offer is for company called Perficient in their Atlanta office. I would be working on a team with interns from their other office to do some kind of internal project. They really really liked me when I interviewed with them ( they said if they couldn't have fit a sophomore in to their intern class they would have given me a full time offer for after I graduate).

Any advice on what would put me in the best position going forward?

Thanks.

I will be interviewing for McKinsey's doversity leaders program, but I don't want to bank on getting an offer from them."

I'm currently a junior CS major at a top 20 university (which probably doesn't matter, just giving some background). Compared to my peers, I definitely still have much to learn and improve on in terms of coding, which I am teaching myself and practicing. I recently was offered an IT internship from a company which I wouldn't consider as the most known for tech/software but they are definitely top 5 in their industry. I accepted this internship as it seemed like a great opportunity for someone who was still learning, but now I am having doubts. 

I've always been told that the internship before your senior year was extremely important as it would most likely lead to your first graduate job, and set you on your career. Don't get me wrong this company seems like a great place to work, but my dream jobs are the top 4 as well as many of the companies in the Valley (Spotify, Yelp, Yahoo). I fear that if I were to stick with this company, I would have a more difficult time getting into dream jobs because I may not have learned the skills that someone who worked at a software focused company might. 

My question is: 
-What advice would you give for someone who may have started out at a company that might not teach as many skills in software development, but wants to chase a software development focused job later in their career? 
-What can I do on my own that will attract recruiters even if I might've come from a company less known for software? 
-Is this a reasonable fear that I have? Maybe my views are skewed because I'm reading about so many people getting these awesome internships on this subreddit.

Any and all advice would be appreciated. I want to know what my options are and how I can best approach building my career. "

Some context might be helpful:

* I'm currently at the end of my first year in an IT degree
* Have been programming / building projects during the year
* Managed to get an internship at a startup over the summer (Nov - Feb) doing backend web development
* Transferring into a CS program next year

I'm looking to take some MOOCs over the summer alongside my internship to catch up on the theory I've missed out on whilst in my IT degree.

What I currently have chosen is the following but I'd like to hear from some more experienced people as to what they'd do in my shoes.

* Mathematics for Computer Science - MIT
* Data Structures &amp; Algorithms CS61B - Berkley

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to handle more than 2 over the break, so I'm even more critical as to the choice.

Any help would be great, thanks.

I do not have any work experience or prior internship experience in the CS/programming field.

I found a position in a small company that I applied to.  It's a .NET developer position and they're looking for someone with BS in Computer Science, at least 2 years of experience with desktop application development, familiarity with C# and WPF, as well as OOP and design patterns.  Pluses include understanding of threading and familiarity with SQL.

A little bit about myself around their preferences, I am proficient with C#.  My experience with WinForms/WPF are not excellent (in my assumption), but to a point where I know what they are and how to develop a basic application.  I've done team and personal projects in WinForm and WPF, but have not done anything more than dragging provided controls and giving them functionality.  I do have solid experience with SQL, but have not done any threading related programming.

I applied for the position and got an invitation for an on-site interview this week.  Knowing what they're looking for and what my experiences provide, should I be concerned about not being a good enough candidate?  How can I prepare myself for the interview, in terms of technical questions relating to C# and .NET?  What about you .NET developers?  What is your experience in the position at the job?

As the title suggest I'm a 22 year old Canadian male who's currently in his 3rd year of computer science (Bachelors), this summer and fall I had the opportunity to have a COOP/internship in my home city as software developer. It is a great experience, however, I feel as though something is lacking.

I really enjoy travelling, experiencing new cultures, and meeting new people. I have travelled/volunteered abroad in the past summers but this summer, like I stated, I stayed in Canada to do my internship. I'm now looking to have the opportunity to find a paid internship for the summer of 2015 abroad, preferably Europe (but I am also interested in Middle Eastern Gulf countries or select South East Asian countries).

I'm essentially trying to kill two birds with one stone: Get to experience all that I listed above abroad while also working professionally.

I'm looking for ideas, suggestions, and any thoughts related to my goal.

If needed I can go more into myself as well as my relevant experience. Language wise, I'm fluent in English and proficient in Arabic and Russian.

Thank you."

I'm a 22 year old American community college student. I began attending after highschool, just because I had no idea what I really wanted to do. I still don't know, and as a result this is the beginning of my 4th year here, which is longer than a typical CC career.

After a while I kind of thought ""engineering is lucrative and pretty cool. Why not engineering?"" I had changed my mind about a specific major a shit ton of times. Everything from biomedical to industrial engineering...and changing my mind back again, but always with the end means of ""I want to apply this form of engineering to work on environmental sustainability from an industrial standpoint"". But honestly, as I look around...it seems like this is not a major job market for engineers, and it seems like my ambitions are doomed.

Medicine also sounds cool...scientific, helping people, an interesting career and field of study..but the problem is it's a HUGE investment of time to make, and a huge setback if it winds up not being particularly interesting to me, ya know? Undergrad, then med school, then residency, then any specialty training that's desired...and the overbearing debt that would accumulate from med school. And I'm not sure if I've boned myself for med school since I'm not a traditional student.

Climate science research is another area which interests me...but it's a pretty niche area with threats to cut it's research looming overhead, and overall a less lucrative field.

and then I've tossed around the ideas of learning some type of trade or joining the military...but at that point it seems like I'm giving up. Neither of which are bad opportunities...but I just don't know if they are ""me"".

I don't really have any firsthand experience regarding any of these...visits to the doctor's office and short conversations with a couple of engineers is really the most I have. And unfortunately my family and I don't have some massive network of successful friends and family...so making a quick phone call to get a job or internship in some of these areas it pretty null.

Plenty of things are interesting enough, but how can someone know if it's really right for them unless they have the experience to do it?"

I've applied to 20-25 American companies, mostly startups, and the responses - if I get one at all - are either that their internship positions have already been filled long ago or that they've decided to go with another candidate.

Mainly, I'd like some confirmation that I'd not be off the mark wearing a pair of dark jeans, a plain button-down, and a pair of black leather shoes. Is this too casual? Not casual enough? (My last internship, I interviewed over skype and if I recall was wearing a black t-shirt).

2lth1q,3,2014-11-09,The Night Watchman,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lth1q/the_night_watchman/,"This is a story from way back when I was in graduate school in Nashville. I wasn't one of the fortunate few that got a funded research admission and so I always found myself searching for local part-time opportunities. These were neatly pipelined with other structured internships and life was good for the most part. I lived in a small studio apartment and managed to starve myself into a savings account. The slew of friends around me in class gave me good company, inviting me to movie nights and the odd hiking trips. 

Not every job I worked at was great, obviously. Some paid less than others and some had the worst managers. The deceptive world of sales got me convincing old folks into buying overpriced cameras they never needed. Aside from the guilt I caught myself with, I also couldn't really find time during the day to work at remote consumer electronics stores. I was getting more involved in research around my second year and I primarily lived off of free food that was offered during featured seminars and other meetings on campus. So after a good deal of thought, I realized that I needed to find a part-time overnight job. I wasn't sleeping much as a graduate student and so I might as well get paid for it, right? 

The next morning, I looked through entries on craigslist and found one that said ""Part Time Over Night Weekend Guard Job (Nashville)"" that paid around 15 dollars an hour. Although I was hoping for a longer lasting job, this sounded like a good catch because I wasn't required to carry arms and I'd be getting nearly 400 dollars for just sitting around at night. Hoping to not lose my spot, I immediately replied to the post giving my name, age and phone number. Around lunch time that day, I got a lazy text message saying ""Meet me at 6pm today. brik building by the bus station"". 

Downtown, Nashville is a famously serene place compared to other downtown areas in the United States. Atleast this is the impression I got from mates who used to live there. Excited, I packed up some food and took the bus from campus, reaching just before sunset. I found the apartment building I was looking for, though there was no sign of activity and the front gate was padlocked. It was a humble red brick building that would've probably housed under 10 families. I waited by the stairs, eager to get started. After all, I wanted every dollar I could get. 

Seemingly an hour later, a withered old lady slowly walked up the road to find me drowning in the well of boredom. ""Are ya here for the job?"" she said, almost begging for a response. ""Yeah. What's up with this place?"" I said, trying to hide my anger. Clearly the place was dead and nobody was around. There must have been some reason for ""guarding"" it?. She unlocked the door and pushed her way in. I followed her with patience. 

The hallway in the first floor seemed cramped. A dusty reception desk stood beside a single dark elevator on the left and a rustic staircase directly in front of me. A locked door presented itself next to a row of mail boxes on the right. ""This is your room"", she said, struggling to open it. 

""There was a bad fire accident here a few weeks back. Some kitchen on the second floor. They closed down this place and the people here left. One guy on the third floor said he'd come by this weekend. William...um... Davis! William Davis. His stuff's still around I think. He hasn't been in Nashville this year. Gone to Germany or France or somethin... You gotta wait around for him... Help him move if ya like"", she smirked. 

Fetching a torchlight from her bag, she walked into the dark room. I followed her quiety, reminding myself ""Two nights. 360 dollars"". She opened a creaky wooden cupboard on the far corner to find some clothing. She found me a dark blue shirt, a damaged ID tag, a flashlight and some gloves. Handing me a pair of sealed battery packs, she said ""Use em on that lamp.. You got a book or somethin you could read?"". I nodded, showing her the enthusiasm of a chronically bored cat. Ostensibly drained by all this, she started walking to the front door. Turning one last time, she handed me a spare set of keys and said, ""I'll see ya tomorrow mornin. Oh and... there's a...mart few blocks down the road I think.. If you wanna eat somethin.. Alright.."".

Left alone, I felt an amalgam of emotions. Just thinking about the reception I got made me livid. She made me wait for more than an hour and didn't even ask for my name. ""Well... If you don't like it, leave tomorrow morning and you're still a good 200 dollars better than today"", I said out loud. I switched on the desk lamp and positioned myself slowly on the weakly cushioned chair. I pulled out my phone and noticed a fading, crumbling screen looking back at me. I had no confidence that my phone would last the night with only 24% charge remaining.  

The cluttered room was dark and the heat from the lamp kept me warm. Within minutes, my eyes adjusted to the blackness. The sharp corners of the surrounding furniture grabbed my attention. The broad window sill to my left hosted a conference of files, clips and dead plants. The dirty, smudged glass functioned as a portal to the bustling streets of downtown. ""The night's still young"" I thought. Bathing in the tranquility of solitude, I realized the tiredness in my legs. I pulled out my copy of ""Mistborn: The Final Empire"" and slowly settled down, heaving a sigh of fatigue.

""I need a girlfriend.."", I thought to myself. It was almost 1 AM and my depression was setting in. This always happened when I read books. Characters in the fictional world made me both jealous and sad. Misery loves company and I certainly felt miserable. My friends in grad school were mostly engaged or married and here my life felt like a string of pointless jobs. As I lay there contemplating, an indescribable stench presented itself, almost extolling my train of thought. It was as though my brain couldn't decide if it wanted a commanding sneeze or a nauseating vomit, but I immediately stood up and ran to the door. 

I brashly pushed the flimsy door open, coughing my way out. There was a man standing in front of me, aghast. He was a strapping middle-aged guy, easily 6 feet tall, wearing a brown leather jacket. 

""Ugh.. um... Hi?"", I said, filling the air with confusion. 

""..... Hey... Are you the security.. guard?"", he said. 

""Yeah! Are you... Mr. Davis?"", I said, breathing heavily. 

He nodded firmly. ""so.. Mrs. Colton told you about me? I'm here to get my stuff. I've parked my truck down the road"", he said. 

After a rigid handshake, ""Give me a sec.. this place stinks.."", I said. I walked up to the door and slightly opened it. The repugnant stench was hardly noticeable. Surprised, I turned around and beckoned him to enter. He followed me into the security room. I handed him a flashlight and I picked up the lamp. ""We don't have any electricity here. We've got to use the stairs"", I said, wearing my gloves. 

""That shouldn't be a problem. I only live in the second floor"", he declared. 

""Second Floor?"", I speculated, reviving my memories. ""Alright. Let's go"".

We walked up the apparently archaic staircase. Every step caused an intense creak, squeak and groan. Grating dust filled the air and William let out a jarring sneeze. I could swear he shook the whole building. A few steps later, I was startled by a very distinct and clear *thump* coming from directly above. This was followed soon after by another, much louder *THUMP*. I looked back at William with complete shock. His face was pale. I could hear my heart beating. 

*THUMP*.... *THUMP*... *THUMP*.... *THUD THUD THUD THUD*

Both of us ran back down the stairs, shaking with terror. ""Hello?"", I yelled. The crashing sounds escalated. Both Will and I were pointing our lights at the staircase, breathing heavily. It felt like every *thud* resonated with my thrashing heart. With a sudden crash, a large sofa chair slid down and landed on the side of the stairs. I shrieked with panic and jumped backwards. The crash landing caused a violent dispersion of dust. ""God... Dammit!"", Will cried with annoyance. 

I took a few steps back and tried to calm my senses. I was completely befuddled by the large piece of furniture that fell down the stairs. We waited for the dust to settle. It was almost another 30 minutes before I stopped shaking. I looked at my watch and then at Will. He nodded at me and we decided to walk up. It was getting late and neither of us wanted to be there. We walked up the stairs, one step at a time and reached the second floor. There were 4 doors in front of us. Two to the right and two to the left. ""Which one's yours?"", I asked. ""The last one of the right"", he said. The air on the second floor was oppressively muggy compared to the floor below. 

We walked swiftly to the end of the hallway. The white door on the right had a rusty badge. ""Apartment 204"", I said. Will pulled out his keychain and fiddled around until he found the right key. He opened the large door, revealing a wide living room. We walked in together, scanning the surroundings. I was growing flustered by the smell emanating from the room. ""Let's see what we can take"", Will stated. I walked up to the end of the living room and pulled up the blinds. I was able to see the empty road below. ""Freedom... soon.."", I thought, trying to stay calm. There were a few assorted sofa chairs next to us, all facing a television. A vaccuum cleaner, an ironing board and a shoe stand on the far corner. 

Will walked past the kitchen and into the bedroom. A few seconds later, ""Hah.. I might need two trips.. This mattress still looks good"", he said. I followed his voice and walked in, finding Will staring at a single large king-sized bed. There was a dressing table to my right, filled with perfumes, lotions and kits. Will was searching through drawers trying to find something. I was not amused by the thought that I would have to help him carry all this stuff downstairs. 

That's when I heard a whisper. I turned around immediately and took a few steps forward. I walked towards the bedroom door slowly. As I stood there peeking out into the living room, I felt a hard, thrusting push on my back. I lost my balance and fell forward, damaging the bulb on my lamp. The sudden lack of light blinded my pupils and I tried to quickly stand up. 

I thought Will was trying to assault me for some reason. I looked back into the room. Will was busy looking through stuff in a clearly random trunk. Confused, I wondered if my hunger was causing me to lose stability. I was trying my best to recollect what I last ate. 

I turned around and looked at the living room. There was a woman standing there, barefooted. *LUB DUB LUB DUB LUB DUB*, I heard my heart beating. I felt fear down my spine and I was visibly sweating. The light from the living room window revealed her burnt face. She was wearing a red sleepshirt and she was staring right at me. I froze at my spot, gasping for breath. She started walking towards me. Every step felt heavy. Every step resonated with my heart beat. She never blinked. Her eyes were dead. As she approached me, her silhouette faded. I felt an icy cold touch around my neck and I was blocked by the bathroom door behind me. 

A few seconds later, I heard a whisper. ""Run... ""

Suddenly, I felt liberated. I dropped to my knees and sensed a jolt of pain around my neck. I stood up and turned to the bedroom. Before I could open my mouth, the door shut close. The sudden crash hurt my ears and I fell back. I stood up one last time and started running. I ran out the door and down the stairs. I picked up my bag and ran out the building. I don't know who she was. I don't know what happened to William. I don't care about the money. I just.. wanted... to run...

I had the chance to go to a Hackathon and meet companies. One of the companies I really liked was Nest. When I was talking to them, it was just me trying to understand what they were saying. They threw around words like ""API, source code, Firebase, etc."" and it was just me nodding my head in agreement so I wouldn't look like an idiot. I felt like I was really behind compared to all my peers at the Hackathon. 

     After the event, I went on Nest's website to check out their API and I honestly don't know what to do. I learned a bit of Python over the summer, but I feel overwhelmed and behind right now. "

The PM internship at Microsoft had always been my dream internship/job. Since my first year of university, I've been invited to the MS internship interviews every year.  


I was more prepared this year than ever. I am finishing an 8mo PM internship at a top 10 software company, and will be doing a 4mo Dev internship in January. However, I am quite devastated that I didn't even get an invitation for this year's university campus screening interview. When I emailed the recruiter, she said all the PM internships for next summer have already been filled. But it is only November?

Is there anything I can do? Thanks."
2luhvd,5,2014-11-10,Someone to Watch over Me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2luhvd/someone_to_watch_over_me/,"**Here's the deal, I found this laptop and a small statue of a dog in a box in the elevator of my apartment complex. The other night the power was out for the whole building, and a few days ago once the power was restored and the elevators were back up and running I called it up and low and behold as I walked in to the elevator this box with a laptop and this dog statue was sitting in the far right corner. The box was labeled, """"junk, do not return to owner"""". I took the laptop and box with me to my car and later when I got home I opened the laptop and running was a notepad software already open and with the following written in it**

- Hello me, I’m just going to be writing this little journal here on the laptop so I don’t get bored, I like to write   and I figure if I type down my thoughts and stuff it’ll help me feel less lonely and give me  something to do.    
  

- I’m awake now yet somehow the sky outside is dark again. For the past few days I have been exhausted due to   finals week at school, but now it is summer and I look forward to resting. I have no classes and did not get an internship like I had hoped so I am stuck home for most of this summer. This past semester left me exhausted and on the last day of finals I came straight to my apartment and collapsed on my bed only to wake up at 11 at night, I’m up now browsing the web reading articles and playing little games, the night sky looks quite peaceful from my window but I feel a bit lonely now that the semester is over. I have a very small amount of friends   because I like to keep my circle small. I have 2 good friends and that’s it, the only problem is that they are out of town back home to their home towns up north while I am stuck here alone.


- I am writing this because I am lonely, I just need to type to myself to get out all these thoughts swirling in my head, I woke up around 11 P.M. so I stayed up until now, it just turned 3 A.M. I made some ramen noodles and now I’m just staring out my   window into the dark sky. I wish I had cable but I cut back on things like cable and eating out to save money. My apartment has a Wi-Fi hotspot for its residents to use so that’s cool.  I’m going to just watch a movie online or something, I don’t even know if I should sleep again or wait until it is night time. The dark sky still makes it seem like night but it’s just very early in the morning.  



- Well, I stayed up until almost 5:00 in the morning and fell asleep, I woke up today at 2:00 in the afternoon to a rainy day. I’m staying in today, it’s pouring out and the lightning is bright and frequent. As I ‘m sitting here at my computer the lightning flashing from outside made something in my peripheral noticeable. To   my left as I type this there sits a statue of a brown dog with big round black eyes, I forgot I even had this statue until the lightning lit up its eyes making it very noticeable. This statue is a small little piggy bank, shaped   like a dog. Oh yes I remember now, it was given to me by my mother and once belonged to my grandfather. The dog sat with its head tilted giving off the creepiest sad puppy dog look I have ever seen, and its eyes were indeed lifeless and a bit disturbing. I’m trying to ignore that it is even here but those big black lifeless eyes are hard to ignore, I feel a bit bad that those eyes were the only pair of eyes besides my own that I have seen since classes ended.



  
- I feel kind of strange, my body aches and I have the chills, I believe I am about to become sick with the flu or something, I really hate being sick, I wanted to get out tomorrow but I feel terrible. I’m also starting to feel even lonelier, I might call my friends later to see what their up to, but for now I’m just going to lay down.
I’m up again and again staring at me from my left is this dog statue. I still feel sick and it’s now 12: 26 midnight. I hate waking up to the dark sky, it feels…wrong. I keep looking up over at this statue and hoping it won’t be staring at me anymore, it is watching me intently as if saying to me  “I am here if no one else is.” The more I think about it, I have spent more time with this statue, fixed in its gaze more than I have with my own friends throughout the year because of how much I stay home rather than go out.  I still feel sick and I could really use some company, this dog statue isn’t really doing it for me.




- I fell asleep in my chair and woke up with this throbbing headache and the power being out, it is 2 a.m. and I feel tired and sick, but most of all I feel lonely. The power is out but my laptop still has a good amount of battery power. I hear faint music from the other side of my wall. There is a really old lady who lives in the apartment next to mine who loves to play these old records on her record player. She is playing a weird old song, I have no idea what the song is called but the dark room and the gleaming eyes of this statue are not a good mix, I need to get out but I feel very sick and have no energy. The song playing through my wall is quite a somber song, I decided to go ask what the name of the song was, mostly because I needed some sort of human attention, ANY human attention, I walked out of my apartment into the dark hallway, it was the first time I have seen the hallway not lit up by lights, it was strange to say the least, it was only lit by the emergency lights above the door leading to the staircase. Anyways,  I went and knocked on her door and she answered it seeming both surprised but strangely happy to see someone, I just told her I was checking to see if her power was out to even though I was well aware the whole building or at least this whole floor was without power. After a bit of chit chat I asked her the name of the song playing, she told me it was a song called “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence, and told me it was her mother’s favorite song. She invited me in but I declined citing that I didn’t feel too well and I wanted to go back to my place and lay down. So now I’m sitting here in the dark again with this damn statue staring a hole through me, I’m not going to move it because once I move it, I will have given in to the fact that an inanimate object has spooked me to the point where I think its eyes are actually “watching” me rather than just being a set of fake eyes with no real function. The moment I move that statue is the moment my fears of it become real and it no longer is just a statue, instead it’s something that can cause me to be uneasy, something that can cause me to become frightened.



- I fell asleep again but this time in my computer chair, I awoke to the same set of lifeless black eyes staring at me and the sound of a record skipping repeatedly, I’m going to wait about 5 more minutes and if it’s still skipping I’m going to go over and check on the old lady next door to see if everything is ok.



- I’m freaked out right now, its 4 A.M. now, last I typed here I said I would wait 5 minutes then go check on the old lady next door. Well 5 minutes went by and I went to go check on her, I went to her door and knocked but there was no answer just a skipping record echoing through the door, feeling as though something were wrong, I decided to try the door and it was unlocked. I looked into the apartment, it was dark with one single candle flickering in the hall way and a skipping record steadily sounding off in the darkness, I walked in and over to the living room area and saw another candle and the silhouette of the old woman sitting in an armchair next to the skipping record. She was sitting straight up in a recliner chair with her arms both resting on the armrests, I could only see her outline and could not make out any other details besides her silhouette in the very dimly lit room. I called out to her and she was unresponsive, I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder and realized she was not responding at all no matter how much I tried to get her attention, I rushed over here to my apartment and got my cell phone and called 911, after I called 911 I waited with her in the dark living room. I took the needle off the record to stop it from skipping and sat there alone with her, in the very dimly lit room, I sat for a few minutes then something happened that creeped me out more than I have ever been crept out in my life, the old lady turned her head to her left and said in a voice that I didn’t recognize to be hers and said “Don’t you remember the lonely nights Mortimer?”, after that statement from the calm and deep voice not matching the old ladies voice from when we spoke earlier, the lady’s head turned ever so slowly back straight forward. Miss are you okay I asked, but no response, Miss are you okay I asked again this time placing my hand on hers. Once my hand touched her skin I snapped my hand back because of how ice cold her hand was, I was about to inform her that I called the ambulance to make certain she was okay when I spotted something very unnerving. There sitting on the table next to the record player. Ever so faintly I could now make out the figure to her left, I guess my eyes had adjusted to the dim light of the room enough for me to see it now. This “It” that I could now see was a statue of a brown dog with big black eyes staring at her as she sat in her chair, it was facing her much like the one I owned faced towards me. I thought that this is merely a coincidence that she had the same statue piggy bank of a dog like I have, I even got up and walked over here to my apartment to make sure my statue was still here and sure enough it was and still is. I couldn’t even sit in that living room anymore I stood at the edge of the dim candle lit hallway and waited for the paramedics to arrive, they arrived and after a few cycles of CPR she was pronounced dead at the scene. 




- As I sit here and type this my own “watchdog” or rather “watching dog” sits to my left burning its lifeless gaze right through me, it is 5 A.M. and still dark out and the power is still down. I can’t believe the old lady is gone, I can’t believe she might have died while I was still in the room with her, I feel strange. Maybe, I could have helped her I don’t know…everything is getting to be a bit too much for me right now. I have so many questions that no one will be able to answer, why did she speak to the statue?? Why did her voice sound so strange? Oh lord, did she really die that moment while I was in there with her??? WHY did she have the same eerie dog statue as I do? This is definitely going to keep me guessing for a long time to come. I still refuse to move my statue, I will not give in to silly irrational fears. If I move it, it wins…However, Just the statement “If I move it, it wins” is a sign I have given in to fear already.




- Ok I’m back at it again, I laid down to try to sleep at around 5:15 but was woken up by a strange faint noise from the other side of my wall. The noise turns out to be music, not just any music but the same song from before, the same song the old woman had been listening to before she died. I heard it loud and clear now, it was “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence. I sat up and rolled my eyes at this situation, I’m weird like that, when frightening things happen I kind of get upset that it is happening in the first place, almost like it is an inconvenience to me for something frightening to be happening to me. Then as I turned my head I was frozen stiff, I didn’t want to move because from my bed I could see that dog statue and those big black eyes staring at my computer chair as if it was waiting for me to sit so it could peer straight into my soul like it always does. I finally mustered up the courage to grab my laptop from my desk and bring it to my bed, I’m typing this with that damn dog sitting in its spot while that record plays, well its skipping now and I wish it would stop…Wait it did stop…and now the song is playing again. I’m finished with this journal and I’m getting out of this apartment. I’m done typing and I’m done feeling trapped.




- Ok so my getaway plan was foiled, I was walking and something pulled me back, not something physically pulling me back, just something inside me engrained deep into my psyche that told me I just couldn’t go another second without solving this mystery, I had to go into the apartment, I had to try to get some closure and also I had to stop that music from playing, I just had to! I walked over to the old lady’s door, it was surprisingly still unlocked even after the paramedics left. I walked in there and fumbled in the dark and turned off the music. As I was leaving I felt my hand brush the top of something. I adjusted my hands to the object and felt the coarse and hard object between my fingers, I knew it was her dog statue. I don’t know why but I grabbed it and left the old lady’s apartment and came back here to my own apartment. Now I am here with two of those statues. Her statue however was heavier, like it had something in it. I turned the statue upside down and noticed a round metal cap, I guess a place where any money stored in the statue can be retrieved. I popped open the cap and took out an assortment of old coins and a single picture, a picture of a little girl and a woman, and inside was a note that was scribbled frantically on the back of the picture. The note reads, “I need no friends because you watch over me, now and forever I am in your gaze because now and forever your eyes are the only friends for me.” This was strange, I didn’t understand it, I was now compelled to investigate my own statue, now I must admit what I found in that statue was indeed strange to me but not as strange as what I found inside my own statue. Inside my statue was a picture of me when I was about 5 years old, there I sat smiling and happy, and behind me sat the dog statue staring as it always does. I am confused and frightened, I do not know what any of this means and I don’t ever remember this picture being mentioned to me by my mom, this statue that belonged to my grandfather before he passed on has always been in my possession since as long as I could remember.  This will be my last post, I’m going to head out, I have to get out of here and away from all th

Hello,





dabit              deus                 his         quoque             finem





- I am back dear journal and I must say I feel silly for being afraid this entire time. I have no need to be afraid, you see Mortimer is my friend. Mortimer watches over me, his eyes are all the friends I need. I’m going to turn off my computer so I can be alone with Mortimer, he enjoys the dark and I will enjoy it with him.

	

**Below is a link to a picture of the dog statue I now have, I don't know what to do with this stuff. Is it a joke?, I do remember the ambulance coming to the building and looking out my window to see someone being carted away in a body bag up on a stretcher, I was kinda freaked that someone had died but didn't worry about it too much, I don't know anyone in this building really so the owner of this stuff is unknown to me, This dog statue does give off a strange vibe though...**

2lwgbo,47,2014-11-10,What is a typical job acceptance rate? Starting to pile up on rejections even after doing well in the interview...,csthrowaway420,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lwgbo/what_is_a_typical_job_acceptance_rate_starting_to/,"I have no trouble getting interviews, having a pretty good GPA at a decent school and an good (not great) internship at a well-known tech company. I am now 0/7 in interviews and starting to get a little concerned. Is this a red-flag that something is wrong or is this par for the course? 

I've done interviews at eBay, Facebook, Palantir, Red Hat so I'm not surprised to be rejected but I am also being rejected by lower-tier companies that I would consider ""safety companies"" like IBM and National Instruments who ask very easy, sophomore level Object-Oriented questions.

I would consider my algorithm skills okay, though I do resort to a somewhat brute-force implementation occasionally. I do not think I'm coming off as arrogant. Is this normal for a job search? Is there any other possible reasons to be concerned?"
2lwjis,0,2014-11-10,As a soon-to-be graduate how do I tackle applying to companies which seem to demand working knowledge of a coding language?,Sanuuu,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2lwjis/as_a_soontobe_graduate_how_do_i_tackle_applying/,"I'm graduating next year with an MEng in Information and Computer engineering. I've worked mostly with MATLAB, Java and low level assembly language in the past (due to classes and a work placement) but I'm aiming for a career in the field of robotics and all the robotics jobs out there require C++. I guess I *could* just read a self-teach C++ book but I feel like that would be a waste of time given that I could spend all that time working on my final year project which is actually practical and exciting.

I feel confident that if I landed a job needing knowledge of virtually any coding language, given several months I could get that knowledge, so maybe even before I commence the job. I mean, at the final day review of my recent internship, my line manager was shocked to find out that I've done no work in MATLAB before the work placement. Based on how fast I got into the project assigned to me he just assumed I knew MATLAB.

Is there a way to demonstrate that readiness to learn to a potential employer? Can I hope for a job using a language I have not worked with before? Am I doomed to huge companies' graduate schemes where I might or might not end up with a job I like?"
2lwjqu,5,2014-11-10,Ambitious recent college grad starting to lose all hope for accomplishing my dreams.,cookielee,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2lwjqu/ambitious_recent_college_grad_starting_to_lose/,"I just graduated with my marketing degree in May with a 3.5 GPA and a great resume. I worked extremely hard during school, always tried to get the best internships and was the vice president of our entrepreneurial alliance. I've always had big dreams of living in a city, having a great career and being successful. I was extremely determined with my job hunt and had several solid job prospects before graduating and ended up landing what I thought was my dream job in nyc about a month before graduation. 

Once I got the job, I started developing severe anxiety knowing that I was going to be struggling financially with this job. I have $40,000 in school loans, $5,000 car loan, and $1200 in CC debt.  My debt plus the combination of rent in nyc and an entry-level salary was not ideal. Due to this I started rethinking my decision but ended up getting highly pressured into taking the job from my parents. 

Three weeks before I was supposed to move, my anxiety only worsened. I couldn't sleep, could barely eat, and started having constant panic attacks. Due to family pressure, I still made the move to NYC and started my job. My anxiety was so bad that I literally could not even think and was always on the verge of a panic attack. I came home one weekend and my parents saw the state I was in and they realized the severity of it so they decided it would be best to resign. 

Right after this, my anxiety also turned into a deep depression. I was stressing out about not having a job and kept pursuing opportunities, landing 3 great positions, but was not able to take them because mentally I was not in the right place, which was extremely hard for me to accept. 

I have taken the time to get well mentally at home and I now feel ready  to start my career. I never wanted to live at home after graduating for many reasons but mostly because I am from an extremely small town with little to no opportunities. 

I've now been applying to jobs and am having no luck. It's extremely frustrating going from receiving various solid job offers and getting every job I interviewed for to now not even be able to land an interview. 

I'm just not sure what I should do now and what I should say that I have been doing for the past 6 months? I am just starting to feel hopeless and feel like I'm going to be stuck in this small town forever. Any advice would be helpful!!!

[What is the strongest argument you've heard *against* net neutrality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clykquq?context=5)|Good question.  Like any consequential policy debate, there's passion on all sides -- you've seen a lot of that around the Internet today.  Let me start out by saying that the arguments FOR net neutrality are overwhelming, and the stories that we have heard over the last months and years, in response to the President's leadership on this issue, have meant a lot.  Founder after founder of start-ups have told us that without a free and open Internet, they would have never had a chance to get started, and grow from a garage to a Fortune 1000 company.
 |Any rule on net neutrality has to be carefully designed.  And it's certainly our hope that they won't be needed -- that ISPs won't be engaging in the sorts of practices that would have them collecting tolls from edge providers, or picking winners and losers.  Some have argued that in a truly competitive broadband marketplace, you could see ISPs competing with different prioritization packages -- maybe one specific to gaming, for instance.  But today, broadband markets in the United States aren't competitive enough to support that. There continue to be challenges of broadband competition, but with strong net neutrality rules, we can ensure Internet users in under-served markets are protected. 
[Putting Net Neutrality aside for a moment. What is the President's stance on patent reform? In particular, how does the administration plan to combat the patent troll environment that exists today in the software world? Innovation has been stifled in many ways by broad patents or patents held by non-practicing entities. Is this even on the administration's radar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clyp5cl?context=5)|You may know that this is not something most people were talking about two years ago.  But us policy-types had actually been looking at it for some time, and on 2/4/13, the President did G+ [hangout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp_zigxMS-Y) and gave a pretty forward-leaning answer to the patent troll issue.  At his direction, we ran a process that led to some [announcements](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patent-issues) about ways the Patent Office would improve the way it did business, and also laid out a set of priorities for Congress to take action.  In December, the House passed a bill addressing the patent troll issue, and while the Senate has yet to act, we [continue](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/20/fact-sheet-executive-actions-answering-president-s-call-strengthen-our-p) to find new ways to improve the patent system on our own.
 |But a comprehensive solution requires revisions to law, so we’ll [keep pressing]( http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/28/president-barack-obamas-state-union-address) Congress to enact comprehensive patent reform legislation.  This isn’t a partisan issue, and we hope it is really is something that can get done next year, if we continue to echo calls like these.
[Why did he nominate a person to head the FCC with the exact opposite goal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clylkjf?context=5)|That's why the President felt that it was important to outline steps that he believes the FCC should put in place to protect net neutrality as the FCC considers the path forward.  Over the past few months, the President has worked with his policy teams to analyze all the available options and to formulate the strongest possible proposal to protect net neutrality. The President also recognizes that almost 4 million Americans, and dozens of companies large and small, have written to the FCC to express strong views on this issue.
[How does it matter? Since the telecoms can write larger checks than the users of the services, we have no say in this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clynqsv?context=5)|I think this issue has made clear that just isn't the case.  Nearly four million people had their view heard.  And today, the President added his voice further elevating this issue to the very top of the public debate.  That's hard to ignore.
 |Take another issue, like [cell phone unlocking](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/its-time-legalize-cell-phone-unlocking).  That wasn't on anyone's radar screens until it broke on We the People -- the White House's petition platform.   And after we outlined a way to fix it, we had FCC action, industry agreements, and ultimately, a bill signed by the President.  All because of voices like yours.
[Is there a plan to Support/Allow/Protect Cooperatives in any municipalities, towns, villages or communities that want to build/own, maintain/control Last Mile &amp; WiFi? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clypama?context=5)|This is [something that Tom Wheeler has actually opened an inquiry into](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/removing-barriers-competitive-community-broadband), and that the FCC is seriously examining.  Having heard from a number of communities where it has made a difference, we have been [looking into the issue as well](http://www.ntia.doc.gov/federal-register-notice/2014/community-broadband-workshop), and while it's clear most of the work here is at the state and local level, we would of course welcome your thoughts about what the Executive Branch might be able to do within our authorities.
[Can you respond to accusations that these proposed regulations are out of date and will actually do more harm than good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2lvly9/i_am_r_david_edelman_president_obama_just/clymsad?context=5)|The telecommunications act empowers the FCC to apply the parts of the law that are appropriate to the technology at the time. As the technologies change, so does the way in which the FCC applies the law.
 |As the President said today, ""if carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs...If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above — principles that most ISPs have followed for years — it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the internet.""

As far back as 2007, he made clear that [he “takes a backseat to no one”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j8lP9suvP8) when it comes to protecting online freedoms and innovation in the Internet marketplace.  The plan the President outlined today is another extension of that philosophy and the clearest way to protect Net Neutrality for everyone.

But I can tell you that the rules the President outlined today would certainly allow for enforcement should they be violated by any ISP, wired or wireless.  That’s why the rules the President is urging the FCC to pass are straightforward, bright-line rules banning practices like blocking or paid prioritization.

2lwngj,1,2014-11-10,Stay with Computer Science / IT or go for Electrical Engineering?,varisforge,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/2lwngj/stay_with_computer_science_it_or_go_for/,"Hi, /r/careeradvice!

I really need some good advice. I have been working towards a mechanical engineering degree for a while and suddenly had to change jobs.

I got myself into this mess by deciding to take my associates in Computer Science (as a backup in case something happened and I couldn't complete a transfer only ME degree, as the prereqs were almost identical) and got my first adult type job in IT. The position gave me time to continue working on my actual degree, albeit at a slower pace.

Then, things got messed up and I decided to quit that job. My pay kept being messed with, my hours were getting messed with, and even though I was either 1st or 2nd rated by our ticket software in the state, I kept getting passed on pay raises and promotions. 

I got a new job with a 50% pay raise, 3 weeks PTO, benefits, the works. It's a great position for anyone at my level. However, the new location is 30+ minutes from my college, my college has no online alternatives for my chosen education path, I had to skip a semester just to get my foot in the door here, and now I'm at the crux of my situation.

My end goal is to become a Patent Agent (and possibly Patent Attorney if I decide I like the legal aspect of things.) This is due to my  direct passion of being an inventor and wanting to know how to patent my own work. I also need a good paying job to support myself and my family while I work on my hobby/hopeful future business. 

Because of the new job, I'll have to go to school online. The only schools that offer ABET accredited [online](http://www.abet.org/online-programs/) Class A [Patent Agent compatible degrees](http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/exam/OED_GRB.pdf)  are Arizona State University's [online EE program](http://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-engineering-electrical-engineering) and Regis University's [Online Computer Science program](http://www.regis.edu/CPS/Academics/Degrees-and-Programs/Undergraduate-Programs/BS-Computer-Science.aspx).


Computer Science Pros: 


* The company I work for will pay 90% of my college tuition and books up to $6,000 a year as long as I stay with computer science.  
* Given my transfer credits I would probably only need about 45-50 credit hours to graduate.  
* Total Cost would be (after reimbursements) about $13,000 give or take  
* I already have several years experience built into the career path.  
* Lots of options available within the next 3-5 years for more exciting opportunities.  

Cons:

* I don't know if I want to stay with Computer Science. It pays the bills but it does not excite me.  
* Paying another $13,000 to be bored is terrifying to me.  
* Meh applicability towards Jurisdoctorate
* Not a lot of Patent Agent jobs for Computer Science


Electrical Engineering Pros:


* Close enough to what I want to do.  
* Decent starting salaries  
* Good applicability towards JD (should I go that route)  
* Challenging and interesting  

Cons:

* Expense. I would be OOP for about $26,000 in student loans instead of only $13,000. (Roughly same credits) 
* Employability. Breaking into a new career field from scratch.   
* Internships would be difficult if not impossible because of my current employment.  
* Time. I would need about 6 more months to finish the course work.  


Crap. This was a lot of writing. Thank you in advance to anyone who can slog through the text and give decent advice.

2lwpbm,1,2014-11-10,Need advice! Can't seem to land an internship with big tech companies.,chrismallon23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2lwpbm/need_advice_cant_seem_to_land_an_internship_with/,"Hello. So I am freaking out a bit and its very frustrating. I am currently a sophomore in college majoring in Computer Science and I am having a bit of trouble getting an internship. I have developed my own Android app which has gotten more than 300k downloads, and I worked at a small startup for the past two years (Full time in the summer, part time during school). At the startup, I do a lot of work ranging from backend work to app development. Last year I applied to Google and got an interview, I did really well on the first one, but got nervous and my school WiFi failed so I did horrible on the second one. This year, I tried applying again, but was rejected right away and didn't even make it to an interview. I also applied to Microsoft, Amazon,Facebook(with referral) and a few other big tech companies, but have yet to hear back. Is it still early or am I doing something wrong? After failing my Google interviews last year, I spent some time practicing algorithms/data structures and feel much more confident for the interviews."
2lwxku,1,2014-11-10,Dad keeps borrowing my car...,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2lwxku/dad_keeps_borrowing_my_car/,"I'm currently a full-time college student. My parents got tired of me borrowing their cars to go to school and decided it was time for me to get my own. I found a car, it's not new and it was not expensive, and it was paid for by someone else as a gift to me. I have my own car, my mom has her car back; everyone's happy.

I have no job at the moment. I've applied to dozens, I'm enrolled full-time in school (graduating in about a year), and right now I'm doing an unpaid internship several days a week. My parents pay for the insurance on my car. I would love to be able to pay for it myself, but I just can't right now - at least not until I can get a job.

The problem now: my dad keeps borrowing my car. Now, I'm completely fine with them borrowing it! I mean, they're paying for my (expensive) insurance! His car is old, it's filthy, and it has no air conditioning. I understand why he would rather take my car - if I had a choice between mine and his, I'd take my car too! But he's becoming more and more demanding of it - expecting it, disrespecting it. The first weekend we brought it home, my parents borrowed it and spilled tea on my upholstery. I was upset and frustrated and their response? ""If you hop on it now, you might be able to minimize the staining."" When asked if they could help me clean it up, they responded ""Ugh, (*my name*).""

Since then, my dad has borrowed it every weekend. I told him I'd like to keep it clean and his go-to response is ""yeah, right."" I've had it for over a year and I've kept it impeccable, but thanks to my dad there are two new grease stains, giant sweat stains,  and a huge, brown tea stain as well as mud stains on my floor and a couple brand new dents and scratches on the body. Before each time he takes it, I remind him to please try to minimize the mess and I'm met with ""uh huh."" Very often it comes back just a little worse than when he left.

Recently he's taken to not asking me to borrow it. He'll ask if I'm using it at the moment (usually on evenings and weekends, when I'm obviously not using it). I'll tell him I'm not and he informs me he's taking it. Even *more* recently, he's stopped telling me where he's taking it. (When someone asks to borrow your car, it's normal to ask where they're going with it, right?) I'll ask where he's going and he'll say ""out."" I'll keep pressing and he will only repeat ""out"" or ask again if I'm currently using it and, if not, he's taking it to go *out*.

It's feels relevant to mention here that he has a history of wrecking cars. Just completely totalling them. I think he's totalled four, maybe more.

I've gone to my mother for help and she refuses to get involved. Her revolving responses are ""so?,"" ""well, we pay for it,"" and ""ugh, (*my name*), let it go!""

AAAAAAARGH!!! SO, REDDIT, HELP ME: I feel it's obvious that they don't respect my car or me. At what point is it okay to say enough is enough? Am I allowed to *not* allow my parents to borrow my car if they're the ones paying it off?

Thank you for any and all advice."
2lwzjy,1,2014-11-10,TIFU by ruining my chance of getting an internship,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lwzjy/tifu_by_ruining_my_chance_of_getting_an_internship/,"This actually happened last Friday, but I just realized this story was worthy of a submission. I'm a senior in high school taking an advanced computer class with a few of my close friends. We took an all day field trip to Progressive last week to tour their IT department and to be scouted for an internship. To determine who they'll choose for the internship, the employees take notes on each of us based on how proactive we are and how well we represent ourselves. 

Anyhow, halfway through the tour they took us in groups for a bathroom break. One of my friends, Andy, was mid piss when he asked, ""Hey Dom, is there a handicap stall?"" Dom, who is another one of our friends, replies, ""Uhh..yeah...why?"" Andy then revealed he had a secret to share with us, and that the handicap stall was the perfect place for a ""team meeting."" Used to his antics, we waited until everyone had cleared the bathroom, and proceeded to cram ourselves into the stall.

Once all four of us we were in the stall (another friend was with us), we urged Andy to hurry up before anyone else came into the bathroom. For safety reasons, I wont divulge the details of the secret, especially since its irrelevant to the story. In an attempt at making a joke, I say loudly, ""Let's cross swords!"" Dom didn't like my joke, and told me he was going to punch me in the dick if we didn't get out of the stall immediately. As I push open the door, I'm greeted by a Progressive employee, who in a concerned voice says, ""uhh...what's going on in here?"" Shocked by his presence, I say, ""Er..just having a team meeting."" A disgusted look spreads across his face and he quickly turns around and makes a bee line for the door without saying another word.

We leave the bathroom in a fit of laughter. Dom, however, is not amused, and (jokingly?) tells us he hates us all. We proceed to join back up with the rest of our classmates. Throughout the rest of the day, the employee was making a visible effort to refrain from making eye contact with any of us. I also caught him whispering into a few of his colleague's ears what I assume was our awkward encounter. Needless to say, I don't think any of us will be getting that internship.

2lx0gs,1,2014-11-10,The Night Watchman,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lx0gs/the_night_watchman/,"This is a story from way back when I was in graduate school in Nashville. I wasn't one of the fortunate few that got a funded research admission and so I always found myself searching for local part-time opportunities. These were neatly pipelined with other structured internships and life was good for the most part. I lived in a small studio apartment and managed to starve myself into a savings account. The slew of friends around me in class gave me good company, inviting me to movie nights and the odd hiking trips.

Not every job I worked at was great, obviously. Some paid less than others and some had the worst managers. The deceptive world of sales got me convincing old folks into buying overpriced cameras they never needed. Aside from the guilt I caught myself with, I also couldn't really find time during the day to work at remote consumer electronics stores. I was getting more involved in research around my second year and I primarily lived off of free food that was offered during featured seminars and other meetings on campus. So after a good deal of thought, I realized that I needed to find a part-time overnight job. I wasn't sleeping much as a graduate student and so I might as well get paid for it, right?

The next morning, I looked through entries on craigslist and found one that said ""Part Time Over Night Weekend Guard Job (Nashville)"" that paid around fifteen dollars an hour. Although I was hoping for a longer lasting job, this sounded like a good catch because I wasn't required to carry arms and I'd be getting nearly 400 dollars for just sitting around at night. Hoping to not lose my spot, I immediately replied to the post giving my name, age and phone number. Around lunch time that day, I got a lazy text message saying, ""Meet me at 6pm today. brik building by the bus station"".

Downtown, Nashville is a famously serene place compared to other downtown areas in the United States. At least this is the impression I got from mates who used to live there. Excited, I packed up some food and took the bus from campus, reaching just before sunset. I found the apartment building I was looking for, though there was no sign of activity and the front gate was padlocked. It was a humble red brick building that would've probably housed under 10 families. I waited by the stairs, eager to get started. After all, I wanted every dollar I could get.

Seemingly an hour later, a withered old lady slowly walked up the road to find me drowning in the well of boredom. ""Are ya here for the job?"" she said, almost begging for a response. ""Yeah. What's up with this place?"" I said, trying to hide my anger. Clearly the place was dead and nobody was around. There must have been some reason for ""guarding"" it?. She unlocked the door and pushed her way in. I followed her with patience.

The hallway in the first floor seemed cramped. A dusty reception desk stood beside a single dark elevator on the left and a rustic staircase directly in front of me. A locked door presented itself next to a row of mail boxes on the right. ""This is your room,"" she said, struggling to open it.

""There was a bad fire accident here a few weeks back. Some kitchen on the second floor. They closed down this place and the people here left. One guy on the third floor said he'd come by this weekend. William...um... Davis! William Davis. His stuff's still around I think. He hasn't been in Nashville this year. Gone to Germany or France or somethin'... You gotta wait around for him... Help him move if ya like"", she smirked.

Fetching a torchlight from her bag, she walked into the dark room. I followed her quietly, reminding myself ""Two nights. 360 dollars."" She opened a creaky wooden cupboard on the far corner to find some clothing. She found me a dark blue shirt, a damaged ID tag, a flashlight and some gloves. Handing me a pair of sealed battery packs, she said ""Use 'em on that lamp... You got a book or somethin you could read?""

I nodded, showing her the enthusiasm of a chronically bored cat. Ostensibly drained by all this, she started walking to the front door. Turning one last time, she handed me a spare set of keys and said, ""I'll see ya tomorrow mornin. Oh and... there's a... mart few blocks down the road I think.. If you wanna eat somethin.. Alright...""

Left alone, I felt an amalgam of emotions. Just thinking about the reception I got made me livid. She made me wait for more than an hour and didn't even ask for my name. ""Well... If you don't like it, leave tomorrow morning and you're still a good 200 dollars better than today,"" I said out loud. I switched on the desk lamp and positioned myself slowly on the weakly cushioned chair. I pulled out my phone and noticed a fading, crumbling screen looking back at me. I had no confidence that my phone would last the night with only 24% charge remaining.

The cluttered room was dark and the heat from the lamp kept me warm. Within minutes, my eyes adjusted to the blackness. The sharp corners of the surrounding furniture grabbed my attention. The broad window sill to my left hosted a conference of files, clips and dead plants. The dirty, smudged glass functioned as a portal to the bustling streets of downtown. ""The night's still young,"" I thought. Bathing in the tranquility of solitude, I realized the tiredness in my legs. I pulled out my copy of ""Mistborn: The Final Empire"" and slowly settled down, heaving a sigh of fatigue.

""I need a girlfriend.."", I thought to myself. It was almost 1 AM and my depression was setting in. This always happened when I read books. Characters in the fictional world made me both jealous and sad. Misery loves company and I certainly felt miserable. My friends in grad school were mostly engaged or married and here my life felt like a string of pointless jobs. As I lay there contemplating, an indescribable stench presented itself, almost extolling my train of thought. It was as though my brain couldn't decide if it wanted a commanding sneeze or a nauseating vomit, but I immediately stood up and ran to the door.

I brashly pushed the flimsy door open, coughing my way out. There was a man standing in front of me, aghast. He was a strapping middle-aged guy, easily 6 feet tall, wearing a brown leather jacket.

""Ugh.. um... Hi?"" I said, filling the air with confusion.

""Hey... Are you the security.. guard?"" he said.

""Yeah! Are you... Mr. Davis?"", I said, breathing heavily.

He nodded firmly. ""so.. Mrs. Colton told you about me? I'm here to get my stuff. I've parked my truck down the road,"" he said.

After a rigid handshake, ""Give me a sec... this place stinks..."" I said. I walked up to the door and slightly opened it. The repugnant stench was hardly noticeable. Surprised, I turned around and beckoned him to enter. He followed me into the security room. I handed him a flashlight and I picked up the lamp. ""We don't have any electricity here. We've got to use the stairs"", I said, wearing my gloves.

""That shouldn't be a problem. I only live in the second floor,"" he declared.

""Second Floor?"" I speculated, reviving my memories. ""Alright. Let's go.""

We walked up the apparently archaic staircase. Every step caused an intense creak, squeak and groan. Grating dust filled the air and William let out a jarring sneeze. I could swear he shook the whole building. A few steps later, I was startled by a very distinct and clear thump coming from directly above. This was followed soon after by another, much louder THUMP. I looked back at William with complete shock. His face was pale. I could hear my heart beating.

THUMP.... THUMP... THUMP.... THUD THUD THUD THUD

Both of us ran back down the stairs, shaking with terror. ""Hello?"", I yelled. The crashing sounds escalated. Both Will and I were pointing our lights at the staircase, breathing heavily. It felt like every *thud* resonated with my thrashing heart. With a sudden crash, a large sofa chair slid down and landed on the side of the stairs. I shrieked with panic and jumped backwards. The crash landing caused a violent dispersion of dust. ""God... Dammit!"" Will cried with annoyance.

I took a few steps back and tried to calm my senses. I was completely befuddled by the large piece of furniture that fell down the stairs. We waited for the dust to settle. ""Do you really want to get your stuff now?"" I pleaded.

""I'm already here..."" he said. It was almost another twenty minutes before I stopped shaking. I looked at my watch and then at Will. He nodded at me and we decided to walk up. It was getting late and neither of us wanted to be there. We walked up the stairs, one step at a time and reached the second floor. There were four doors in front of us. Two to the right and two to the left. ""Which one's yours?"" I asked. ""The last one on the right,"" he said. The air on the second floor was oppressively muggy compared to the floor below.

We walked swiftly to the end of the hallway. The white door on the right had a rusty badge. ""Apartment 204,"" I said. Will pulled out his key chain and fiddled around until he found the right key. He opened the large door, revealing a wide living room. We walked in together, scanning the surroundings. I was growing flustered by the smell emanating from the room.

""Let's see what we can take"", Will stated. I walked up to the end of the living room and pulled up the blinds. I was able to see the empty road below. ""Freedom... soon..."" I thought, trying to stay calm. There were a few assorted sofa chairs next to us, all facing a television. A vacuum cleaner, an ironing board and a shoe stand stood on the far corner. 

The carpet on the floor felt rough and sticky. I surveyed the room with my lamp, identifying objects around me. I noticed tonal inconsistencies in the walls. The living room seemed alright but the walls by the front door looked heavily damaged. Distinct tears that looked almost like scratch marks, bedecked the wall leading up to the kitchen. ""The accident was just a few weeks back. The walls here seem heavily... damaged... It has to be this apartment..."" I thought.

Will was searching through boxes in the closet next to me. The closet looked pristine in comparison to the rest of the house. I walked up to the kitchen, noticing photo magnets on the fridge. The fridge itself was mostly charred and rusty. The magnets were even less colorful. I was looking for a sign. Anything that would give me clues on Will's life here. My eyes darted towards the cabinet door above the sink. There was something unique about this door. The handle looked predominantly unscathed. I opened the door slowly, trying not to make a sound. My eyes sharpened as I observed a photograph stuck on the inside. It was a picture of William, standing on a cliff. I wanted to inquire about this photo but I stopped myself. I saw Will floating past me and into the bedroom on the right. 

""Hah... I might need two trips... This mattress still looks good,"" he said. I followed his voice and walked in, finding Will staring at a single large king-sized bed. The bed was creamy white with really no sign of use. There was a dressing table to the right, revealing a gathering of perfumes and lotions. Will was searching through drawers trying to find something. I was growing increasingly suspicious. I did not really know who he was and I did not know if someone died here. 

I turned around and walked back into the kitchen. I wanted to find more ""artifacts"". I must have been drunk, or at least critically hungry because the cabinet looked different. The kitchen was structurally the same but the cabinet had no doors. I was stunned by the complete lack of stock presented by the darkness in front of me. I stood there for a minute, convincing myself I was tired. The longer I stayed there, the more dazed I felt. I was breathing heavily now. I strolled past the sofas and towards Will. I spotted a door opposite the bedroom. The door knob looked stale and felt cold. I pushed open the worn slab of wood. I could swear my heart stopped. Standing there in front of me, was a woman. She was wearing a red sleepshirt and staring right at me. The light from my lamp revealed her burnt face. Her head was severely scalded. Her eyes were certainly dead. She was holding what appeared to be a green detergent bottle on one hand and a kitchen torch on the other. 

LUB DUB LUB DUB LUB DUB  

I heard my heart beating. I felt fear down my spine and I was visibly sweating. I fell to my knees and froze, gasping for breath. I started shivering. I felt an icy grip around my neck and I was gawking at the tiled floor. I couldn't move. I felt suffocated. My eyes closed. 

I suddenly felt roused. I was aware of my surroundings and I caught myself standing. I was staring at Will. He was looking through files in a clearly random trunk. I looked at the tall mirror by the dressing table. ""What... am I holding?"" I asked myself, altogether horrified. I was sauntering towards Will. I knew I wasn't controlling myself. My face was gravely stinging but I couldn't scream. I raised my left leg and kicked Will in the head. His forehead slammed against the handle on the trunk and he fell flat. I saw myself clumsily pouring a yellowish green liquid from the bottle I was holding. Utterly frightened, I closed my eyes. 

""Aaahhh..."" I wailed. Sunlight beamed at me from the left. I looked at my watch. ""7:30?!...What the..."" I thought. I hopped up quickly. My head hurt and I was standing in a dusty room, wearing a dark blue shirt. I grabbed my bag and walked out. I noticed the musky reception desk in front of me. I was shaking. I felt cold. I pulled out my phone, with extreme consternation. ""16% charge,"" I gasped. I disrupted my bag trying to find the strips of paper Mrs. Colton gave me. My eyes widened with fear. I found a photograph. "

2lzvo6,5,2014-11-11,No one to talk to,WaronDrugs010101,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2lzvo6/no_one_to_talk_to/,"I've always held suicide close as a sort of eject button. It was easy to put it aside when I was 18-23 because I was still in school and had hopes for the future. But over the past two years things just keep slipping downwards. Every job I held fell apart within a month of me getting it, sometimes my own doing sometimes not. I've had less than $100 at a given time for a year and a half. I've recently moved back into my moms house, and my longtime car finally broke down so now I'm stuck. I applied to an internship with my dream company, Fantasy Flight Games, which would require a move to Minnesota. I busted my ass trying to make money for the move, and I knew it was going to be close. Due to a technical issue from elance (my only inflow of money) I lost over a weeks worth of work which put me too far behind to afford the move, so even if I do get the internship (which I think I have a good chance of getting) I wont be able to take it. I'll be stuck at home for who knows how long waiting for the next opportunity.

I'm diagnosed bi-polar with a tendency to cut myself. Cutting myself is weird. I can't explain why it helps. It's like a control thing. Like even if my life is in shambles and I don't have the control to fix it I can at least control this one small part of myself. My physical body. I'm fully medicated which doesn't prevent suicidal tendencies, it just prevents the emotions that lead to suicidal tendencies. I'd love to feel happy or sad, or anything, but I'm left with this numb sterile emotion. I'd give anything to break down and cry. Just to weep openly and uncontrollably would be nice. I've been listening to the Barenaked Ladies 'War on Drugs' on repeat because it gets me the closest to feeling anything. I wanted to share that song on facebook, as kind of a half-way pathetic way of reaching out, but it'd go mostly ignored and anyone that does puzzle out the meaning would just worry.

I want to tell someone in my life but it'd just worry them. They'd demand I'd go to a hospital to get treatment. I've been admitted to a hospital twice, once my own doing once a shitty doctor's doing. There's no help to be found there. At best you get a medicated vacation from work, at worst you get locked up in a prison like atmosphere where the staff couldn't give a shit about you so long as you don't die. I told myself I'd kill myself before I go to a hospital again. So I can't talk about my feelings with my parents cause they'd tell me to go to a hospital. I certainly can't ever trust a doctor again. I've called the suicide hotline and all they did was try to get me in therapy, which eventually just loops back to hospitals.

The shittiest part of it all is I don't think I have the guts to kill myself. I know I can take the pain. The cutting has prepared me for at least that. Its just the permanence Im afraid of. I'd like to imagine that good times are right around the corner, but every small sign of good news is quickly squelched by the brunt reality of losing whatever small thing I might have been able to hold onto.

I just don't know what else to do. I wish I had the courage to die. But I'm weak. I feel like a poorly designed person. Unable to cope with the responsibilities of living, unable to cope with the permanence of dying. So I'm left in this limbo of self-hatred. Saying this outloud helps a little.

I use to smoke weed to cope which absolutely 100% helps me feel better when I'm having particularly dark thoughts. But I can't afford it so I'm taking 3-4 sleeping pills at a time and smoking cigarettes to try and get the distance from my thought cycle that weed provided. I can't go 5 hours without drinking, smoking, taking pills. Sobriety just leaves me with my thoughts which when alone (like I am 14 hours a day) cycle downwards until Im just laying down staring at the ceiling waiting for the day to pass.

Anyways, thanks anonymous ears. Hopefully this will be my last post here. Hopefully something will happen. I'm trying hard enough, but as it turns out life doesn't care how hard you try or want something. It's kind of an asshole like that.

P.S. I almost cried writing this and for that I am thankful.

I've recently received an offer for a software engineering internship in Chicago for this upcoming summer. I'm a junior economics and computer science major, and had always kind of planned to go into a more traditional finance/consulting role out of college. This being said, prop trading strikes me as a very interesting combination of my fields of study, and the people and office environment at impressed me. I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this, but I have two questions for anyone who can help:

1. I've read that the prop trading/algo trading space is becoming over saturated and that firms are not seeing the success that they have in previous years. Is is a bad/risky idea to start out at a prop trading firm out of college? (I would assume software devs will have more job security than traders but that might not be the case.) What do you think the outlook of the industry is?

2. If I decide that I don't like software engineering or proprietary trading in general, how do you think this internship would affect my chances when applying to consulting, financial analyst, or ""pure"" tech jobs during my senior year? I'm confident that through taking their software and trading training courses and project experience that I will have a lot to talk about in interviews.

Thanks in advance for anyone who can provide insight."

I've just taken over a project that was written by interns and been given a 1300 line js file that does just about everything you can think of. After some simple reformatting to make it legible it came in at just under 2000 lines and in all honesty I can't fathom how on earth it is functioning.

There are two code comments. One says ""Pure js"" under which there is a ton of jQuery and the other is ""jQuery"" under which there is more jQuery but this time inside of the document ready function.
I discovered that it was being called in the header and the footer, the header before any jQuery libraries were called and yet there were no console errors.

I'm not exactly a javascript expert myself and this thing is boggling my mind. I've tried breaking it up into different files (one for ajax, one for form validation etc.) but that broke everything. I've been using jsfiddle to error check and using the (rudimentary) debugging techniques I know but ultimately I'm just working around it until the next sprint is finished.
In the meantime I'm trying to gather some tips on how to proceed. 

So, how do you debug your javascript?

(Also, the js is broken in &lt;ie8 browsers. Could that be because they are less sympathetic to errors?)

Edit: Further question, should I move it all into the document ready function?"

My parents still support me so my income really only goes toward clothes, hobbies, and sometimes food. I work at a family owned comic book store and it SUCKS. I have been working there for 5 months and still make 8 dollars an hour, have no breaks unless I work over 6 hours (which combined with my lunch at 12 and then I don't eat again until 10 is just straight up unhealthy), and I work 5 days out of the week (monday, wednesday, and friday after school) and on the weekends I work pretty much all day. My co workers are also pretty terrible, they are mostly older than me and really don't have future plans like I do. They make fun of me sometimes because I am in college and want to leave that place. A lot of the times they say every job will be this bad (the management here is a complete joke) but I know that is not true.

I am in the process of getting an internship with the help of my high school track coach who works in the IT sector and my dad who has some connections with hospital and police department IT staff as he has worked for multiple departments. Overall I think my chances of an internship soon are pretty good and I also have a CISCO IT cert. already.

Should I just quit my job and focus on school and maybe taking some online courses about computer support? I just feel like I am wasting my time with this dead end retail job. I am just worried it will look bad on my resume if I have a month or two gap in employment

EDIT: Probably the biggest reason I want to quit as well is that I have zero free time and its affecting my health (cant run or cycle) and between school and work I have no days off and very little time to sleep. An average day for me is wake up at 6 school until 2:30 work at 3 until 9:30 then no time after really

Does anyone else have problems with taking timed-tests, such as those given during CS courses in uni?

Has anyone found this not to be an issue after graduation? I can't imagine there will be many 1 hour stretches where I will have to solve problems that I just learned about perfectly. Do I even need to worry about this after I graduate?

I love learning and self-teach really well. I even get good grades on all of the homeworks. It is the exams that always bring me down from my A in the class."

I have two potential interviews lined up for internships next summer. Neither are confirmed yet, but I'm pretty confident where I stand. But I wanted to go ahead and ask before I got too deep in the interview process.

Should I go with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and work on a research project on the Titan supercomputer or should I work as an intern for Rosetta Stone?

Pros:

     ORNL:

          - Only 30 minutes from my house

          - A freaking supercomputer!

          - I can add a proper research project to my resume

          - Get to network with people in my area

          - Structured program specifically for students like me that have not yet started college

     Rosetta Stone:

          - More of a well-known company

          - Actual employment experience as apposed to just research

          - Get to potentially use my Japanese in some way

          - Work done actually has the potential to be used in their products

Cons:

     ORNL:

          - Little pay

          - Lots of hours

          - Less of a known name

          - No experience in a corporate environment

          - My project is assigned to me, so I could potentially be doing research on something that doesn't interest me (this would get weird in an interview down the road)

     Rosetta Stone:

          - Very far away, not sure if they'd pay for relocation yet, that's still to be seen

          - Potentially only mediocre work, coffee runner status

          - Not a structured program so who knows what could happen?

          - Likely unpaid


That being said, what I'd really like to do is work for ORNL on-site, and Rosetta Stone remotely. Do you think I could do those at the same time? How can I bring this up with the RS interviewer? My parents really want me home over the summer, so if I can stay home and work for both places that would be ideal.


Thanks in advance!

I went to a technical/high school and majored in electrical engineering. Through the school I got a job initially stated as computer repair but the company also had contracts for business network administration , it was supposed to be basically a paid internship. Unfortunately a few weeks after I got hired the guy who was supposed to be training me(and the only employee other than owner and wife who did the accountant) got fired. The owner then went through another 5 employees(never more than me and one other guy) within a year. After the year I graduated from High School and went to work full time. My boss suggested that since I graduated and was now full time and he liked my work he gave me a raise and basically put me in charge of computer repair and the corporate contracts, the main of which was a credit union with 125 employees. I was there for 3 more years(total of 4; from early 2004 to late 2008), usually alone taking care of all contracts and regular customers although sometimes with an assistant for a few weeks until my boss fired them again. 

Long story short the main contract dropped our contract because I was in the hospital and they got audited by the NCUA and my boss knew nothing about computers(Got a masters in CS in 92, started business same year, and basically stopped learning new stuff) tried to cover the audit but failed and without the contract the company went out of business. I really liked my job, even dealing with my bosses stupidity(really stupid stuff like buying all 125 windows licenses at staples at retail price) and me not getting paid anywhere near my worth($12 an hour with no benefits or pto when I got laid off) I liked my job. My current job pays better, with benefits, improves lives of thousands of people, less stress, and generally seen as better. The only problem is it is so simple, basic, and easy I am bored out of my mind. There is no challenge and I turn off my brain for 10 hours everyday with my greatest challenge being date and initial about 200 times a day(not exaggerating). I liked being challenged at the computers(I picked stuff up quickly but new problems which actually made me think and research and learn stuff was where I excelled)

I was unemployed for a few months and got a phone call from a recruiter for a electronics manufacturing . Thats what I have been doing since 2008. Most of the time working with lasers doing FDA regulated manufacturing. Now they are closing my location but I am getting a nice severance package. 

I want to get back into computers and especially network security; preferably doing pen test and the like but would also enjoy standard sys-admin stuff. Between savings and my severance I figure I will have about 40k to survive and pay for any certification(Rent and utils ~$600 a month + $200 for car insurance and cell phone). I was thinking of going Network+, Security+ and OSCP. I was also thinking maybe MSCE or CCENT. Am I being too ambitious? Is there any pitfalls I don't envision? I am planning on not doing classes(except for OSCP), just buy books, study, take tests. Is there anything I can do until I get the money to prepare(possibly up to 18 months till they close my facility)?

TL;DR: I have 40k, some experience from last job in network administration and want to get into NetSec. What certs should I get to make myself more employable? "

The CEO is something of a mentor and understood when I asked to travel for a year before committing to a job.

Fast forward 3 months and I am a kindergarten and middle school teacher in South Korea. I am writing from my phone ( sorry for errors ) so I will try to be brief.

I fucking hate half of my job. In the morning I work with the same kindergarteners everyday and in the afternoon I alternate with different classes. The afternoon is fine, even enjoyable perhaps. However, the mornings are a complete nightmare. The teacher before me was awful with the kids. He never did work and let them play all the time. He didn't give a fuck and then left his contract 6 months early. Now they are stuck with me and expect to do no work at all. They also fight about everything and are known around the school as the nightmare class ( I'm their third teacher). Today I lost it a little when they were chanting the old teacher's name in an attempt to persuade me to let them play instead of doing their work. I basically shut down until a Korean teacher came in and scolded them in their native tongue. 

I have worked with kids my whole life and this is by no means my first rodeo but between the last teacher's shortcomings and the truly unfortunate consolidation of terrible children, I am doubting my stay here.

What's the issue? Why not go back to New York and work finance? Well, I was secretly hoping this experience would lead me away from finance. I hoped South Korea would open my world and change my life. The sad thing is, it has. Korea is unbelievable and I love its language and culture. I can't stay here though if I bail on my job. They will not sign a letter of release and I won't be able to work here. I have a sweet gig in New York and it's not like I hate finance... I was just looking for something more. 

Right now my thoughts are suck it up at my job for a year and enjoy Korea the best I can or bail and totally fuck my school and the networks I've made here in order to be a ""real"" person. "

I am currently halfway through a 3 year, part time (night school) M.S in Computer Science. Should I:

1. Go full time as a masters student for spring semester and apply to   software development internship programs?

2. Carry on as a part time student, apply for developer jobs?

3. Continue to work in test while finishing masters part time, then  apply for developer jobs?

Any additional advice on leveraging my current experience and transitioning is appreciated.

I've done some automation and built tools using python and HP Quick Test Pro (VB script). I write the test plans, test cases, and implement/manage the testing, and release the software.  I've worked on the following:

* embedded Linux application

* HTML5 and Javascript web app

I work with small team and always work very closely with the developers.  I have good knowledge of the code bases, and can often tell where in the code a bug is occurring. 

For school or personal projects I've programmed a lot in C on Linux or the STM32 microcontroller (with various peripherals), and also created a website + form + database using HTML5, Javascript/Jquery, PHP, MySQL.  I also have my own wordpress website and I've been customizing the template and plan to experiment with a plugin."

I am a student in my last year of High-School (Y13). I am studying under the CIE Curriculum in an British International School.


I have excellent portfolio overall ('A's across the board in my AS Examinations, internships, leadership programs in school and outside school, volunteering to help the school's network administrator, great reference letters), and I am looking for top universities in the UK to study Computing.

I am looking towards working as a System Analyst after University. Keeping this in mind, I was wondering if you might know where I can find the best learning experience, environment (cities that are highly CS Oriented and I could have big opportunities) and student life. I have looked at lots of University Rankings, but I am looking for a more personal opinion.


Currently I am looking at Imperial College London, University of Bristol, University of Birmingham, University of Manchester.

Also, could you tell me whether Computer Science, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering courses would be more suitable for moving on to working as a System Analyst.

Thanks!"

2m2wmy,4,2014-11-12,Critique my letter of intent?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2m2wmy/critique_my_letter_of_intent/,"I'm considering applying to a grad program for my masters in entomology. I don't have access to my normal support system and critics at the moment, so I'm reaching out to you guys for any suggestions! I'm still tying up the ending as well. Thank you :) 








I am writing this letter to express my sincere and serious interest in furthering my studies at the graduate level at         X.      I would like to pursue my master’s degree in entomology, focusing on the topic of native plants supporting beneficial insects. In December, I graduated from   X  with my bachelor of science in zoology focusing on ecology, with additional degree in German. My time at    X  was pivotal in my decision to apply to the graduate department, as it not only awakened my interest in the field of pollination ecology, but also was essential in helping me to gain valuable research experience. Furthermore, I saw firsthand the high quality research and education that  X       offered, largely impacting my decision to pursue my masters at    X        . 

After assisting with the      CCC          project for two field seasons, I gained valuable research skills in insect and plant identification, crop pollination, field research, and data collection. Working with Vaccinium corymbosum and pollinators piqued my interested in ecological restoration, and how landscape management could be used to optimize crop productivity. Not only did I learn valuable skills that would be highly beneficial in working on this project, I also became impassioned to gain further experience interculturally in this field. This decision brought me to the                   , as I am currently participating in a fellowship program promoting cross-cultural exchange. I’m using this time to further my research experience in the field of agricultural ecology, as well as to gain skill sets that I hope to apply to future research. Currently I’m working on gaining experience in pollen identification and analysis. How pollen analysis can be incorporated into pollination ecology and contribute to research is a question I hope to delve into further this year. Beginning in February I will be assisting with the Garden project             , and I intend to conduct independent research as well. This project looks at the  relationship between pollinators, predators, and urban green spaces. In contrast to my previous research experience, I will be able to gain research experience with arthropods in an non-agricultural setting.  

The graduate assistantship position opening working with native plants and beneficial insects will also seize upon my skills that I have developed over the years. My strong verbal and written skills will be extremely helpful in this position, not only in terms of publishing research, but also for grant and fellowship applications. To balance my strong written and verbal skills, I would plan to focusing on building up my quantitative skills in my graduate studies, something that I look forward to. The ability to communicate research effectively and concisely to growers is not only a skill I have, but also something I believe I can excel at. Leading grower workshops and educating the public about current research is something I hope to do in the future. Looking at the research aspect of the position, my previous experience working with             X      flora and fauna will be especially advantageous in this position. Being able to identify which species are present and how they are impacted by different management styles is an area of study I feel comfortable in and would hope to research more in-depth. Landscape management to promote ecosystem services and incorporating natural ecosystem processes into agricultural is a research interest of mine. Perhaps of utmost interest to me is the focus of this project on selecting native plants that are suitable not only for a specific soil type, but also that make sense ecologically and economically. 

Although pursuing a graduate degree can be a serious endeavour, in terms of both stress and time management, my undergraduate experience prepared adeptly to excel in such situations. While attending     X             , I managed my time between 2-3 jobs, numerous internships, and classes, often simultaneously. While doing this, I was able to maintain a 3.48 GPA, and during my last 4 semesters at MSU, a 3.72. Although my initial undergraduate performance may have been hindered by my overly full-schedule, over the years I developed the skills that allowed me succeed in the face of adversity. These skills I developed will help me to excel in the graduate program in"

2m3566,2,2014-11-12,"Reddit, an ex came back, told me she still love me and then used me to cheat on her current boyfriend--the guitarist in my band (x-post from r/offmychest)",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2m3566/reddit_an_ex_came_back_told_me_she_still_love_me/,"This whole experience has shaken me very badly and I'll try to make sure I put all the facts on the table. Names have been changed, and this account is a throwaway.

I met Jill 4 years ago when I was working a crappy job, before I started going to law school (third year now). Apparently to her it was a love a first sight sort of thing but I never saw it that way and she was always seeing other people. After my first semester of law school we tried to go on a date and had sex afterwards but apparently I wasn't being a great companion. Over the next year and a half we began to have on and off sexual relationships. It was never emotional for me--she would come back each time and tell me how much she missed me and how much she missed the sex and so on, but I never dated her because I had been left by an ex during my first year of law school and never recovered enough to love someone by that point. Jill would keep coming back and I would keep throwing her out because I couldn't make a commitment and I thought Jill was crazy.

Earlier this year I got involved with her and another woman Mary. Mary was fun but she was a party girl and only liked me for my body. Jill and Mary finally met at a big show we had downtown, for which there was an afterparty. I left with Jill from the afterparty and we went back to my apartment and had sex. The next day Mary told me that, against the one thing I asked Jill not to do, Jill had been rude and bitchy to Mary, saying that ""Mary was stealing away the boy that she loved"" and talking about the sexual things Jill and I would do. Jill told me that Mary was the one being a problem and that she had been nice to Mary throughout the night. At that point, I believed Mary and I purged Jill from my life -- phone, facebook, everything.

In late July, while finishing up my second year internship with a biglaw firm, my best friend Chris (and the bassist in the band) told me that Mary miscarried a child back in June, the child was mine, and that all of the common friends between Mary and I knew about it. The same day my friend John (the lead guitarist of our band) showed up with Jill 20 minutes after Chris told me about the kid. Three days later, the biglaw firm chose not to offer me post-graduation employment. I started drinking heavily, went back to soft drugs, and neglected my body incredibly, moving from 155 lbs back up to 200. I've been able to subside the bender because I need to be able to work, but its not completely gone.

I was mad at Mary, incredibly so - so much that I cut her out of my life and told her not to speak to me again. Then I began to blame her for not letting me get on with Jill and the fact that I could have actually started a relationship with Jill, and Jill began to talk to me about what happened. We started talking even more and things began to come to a line of ""what ifs,"" which trigger the two of us to started talking about the past and how things would be different this time. This led to us then meeting up and seeing each other again--at first only talking, but then cuddling, and recently kissing. Jill told me that she was in love with me and she wanted to leave our City and move somewhere else that we could get a fresh start. For the first time I actually felt like I loved her and I agreed to go along, even though John was also in love with her and she was living at John's at the time (Jill's father kicked her out of the house for not going back to college).

Monday night she came over because she wanted to see me. I let her stay while I went to my night class and she helped clean up my apartment, which had fallen into squalor during the bender. When I got back we started cuddling and then she grabbed my penis. Both of us said that it felt like cheating and that we shouldn't do it, but then she started taking off my pants. I went along with it and began to finger her, at which point we said we had come too far to go back. We had sex twice and I sent her home. When she got back to John's, John proposed to her.

Since Monday night she's now said that she wants to stay with John because she thinks that she'll be happier with him in the long run. Meanwhile I am a total mess because I actually love the girl, despite all of these terrible things and she's playing with my emotions. I can't talk to anyone else around here because she's within my circle of friends and everyone likes her. All I can do right now is cry on the floor--I don't understand why Jill chose to do this to me. She claims that she wants to stay with John because he loves her selflessly.

Last night I finished my work and tried to get high to forget about everything, but it made it worse and I had a panic attack. Were it not for a good friend of mine--who was well enough removed from the situation such that no one in my City would know about it--I probably would have gotten no sleep and began to miss classes today. I feel like a human wreck because

(1) I went behind John's back and slept with Jill, who he wants to consider a fiancee -- after 3 months of John and Jill barely dating. I should note that John was a law student a year ahead of me and recently failed the State's bar examination, forcing him to work as a law clerk for a shoddy lawyer and a night food delivery person. John lost his job with the law firm after his computer crashed with vital evidence for a malpractice lawsuit. He is unable to sustain rent and is becoming reliant on handouts from Jill, who comes from a rich family. (2) I loved Jill and she wouldn't believe that I was serious about making things work this time because I had used her before; we were making plans for what I would do after graduating (3) all of the good friends I have in this City right now know all parties involved and the previous history between Jill and I (4) the last time I had this much stress in my life I focused on my work and lost a number of friends in the process, engulfing myself in law school (5) things have now become a Mexican standoff. If Jill tells John, I'll probably lose everyone I have close here. If I tell John, I'm afraid that Jill will attempt to accuse me of rape even though the sex was consensual, placing a black mark on me for State Bar Examination purposes.

Reddit, I've done a lot of bad things in my life but I think this is the worst. Right now I just feel numb inside because I feel Jill played on my emotions and used me for sexual gratification -- I believe that the ""proposal"" does not actually exist at this point. I also think Jill lied to me about her interaction with Mary before. At the same time, Jill told me she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me and I was looking forward to it. Can anyone help me make sense of this? I'm losing my mind and I have no one else to talk to.

TL;DR -- kicked an on/off fuckbuddy out of my life when another woman said she had been rude and a bitch; the other woman miscarried a child and didnt tell me, fuckbuddy started dating my guitarist. feel in love with fuckbuddy after seeing what i could have had, emotions hit a flare and we fucked again. guitarist proposed, fuckbuddy says she'll stay with him because he loves her selflessly, won't talk to me now. i am current at a state of depression i've only reached once in my life before and its effect my body, work, and mind."

I attended a year of a Technical College High School program for Computer Information Systems, which I found to be a bit boring (it was basically the all too frequent ""3 H's Intro Course"" [History / Hardware / HTML])

I started to attend community college to get prerequisites done for a Computer Science or an Information Security major, but I don't have funding available from parents anymore.

That being said - I am fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (those of course in addition to everything simple like filesystem navigation, unix/linux/osx commands, batch, etc)

Are there ANY jobs / internships, etc that I could get either working from home - or making enough money to pay my own rent/utilities/bills and save for college at the same time?

I've got a couple ideas already, namely the following:

I just interviewed for (and was offered) a position for the summer that sounds like much more fun, within my specialization, which is computer security (and also in the same city where I currently reside!).

The offer is for $24/hour. 

It's less than my brother, a sophomore in college, was making last summer interning in CS. I could TA for my university's CS department for the summer and make more.

Is there any way to negotiate the offer up at least slightly at this stage? Everyone I've met there seems like they'd be good people to work with.

I told the HR guy exactly what I'm currently making... would it make sense to accept the offer and continue to look or should I flat out reject it? (In that vein, is anyone looking for extremely motivated grad student interns and willing to pay me at least what I'm currently making? PM me if so?)

Having put some (not insignificant) effort into *trying* to get a job there, I'm kind of half surprised, considering they asked what I was currently making about three times during the interview process,  and half disappointed.

Edit: I swear I'm not being a greedy bastard or living in a palace, I just can't pay my current rent (and for groceries, cell phone, etc) on less than 30/hr."
2m4cas,89,2014-11-12,How many RAID?,YZBot,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2m4cas/how_many_raid/,"I am often 'blessed' with having interns. I'm very hands-off and tend to find projects that I think they can figure out on their own without causing any damage to normal operation. When they have questions, I point them in the right direction. Seems to work out for both me and the intern. I keep my sanity, and the intern learns IT and self direction. 

All of my interns have had some training. Either they've done something like A+, or they are enrolled in school learning something IT related. They should know basics, at least I assume they do.

For one intern, I suggested setting up a server as a lab machine. They could use it to practice installs, configuration, backups, etc. Anything they might wish to understand better. Also a decent means for demonstrating to me they can do certain tasks before I let them touch anything that might somehow connect to a live machine. 

I pointed out a spare server that was nearly ready to go. Quad core, plenty of RAM, and 4 sas drives.

&gt; yzbot ""There is a good server. Set it up over on that corner tech bench.""

I dig through some software disks and find burned copies of XenServer, random Linux distros, and Windows Server evaluations. I hand them to the intern.

&gt; yzbot ""These should get you started. Oh, you'll have to configure the disk array. I see it has 4 drives, how about trying a RAID 10 setup to help disk IO if you run VM's""

I could sense a minor bit of confusion as my intern looked over at the server, and then back at me. I left to attend to my normal duties. He'll figure it out. 

About an hour and a half later I'm greeted by my intern. My first thought is that he's up and running already and looking for more work. Nope.

&gt; intern ""Do you have any more hard drives? I can't find any more.""

&gt; yzbot ""Oh, check the storage shelves.""

Bad disks? I guess that's possible. I checked the hardware out before hand though. Shouldn't be any bad hardware around. Meh, back to my emails. 

Another hour and half later.

&gt; intern ""Is there a different server I can use? I can't make RAID 10 with that server.""

&gt; yzbot ""Really? Let's go see what we have.""

We wander back to the tech lab and I see what my intern has been working on for the last 3 hours. He's packed his server with hard drives. He has 8 drives in it, as many as it will take. Way more space than he could ever use. I look the drives over, they are all identical. It should work. Two more drives are sitting just to the side of the server.

&gt; yzbot ""Bad drives?""

&gt; intern ""I don't think so. They all light up green when I put them in the server. But, I need...""

I cut off his sentence as I turned to the shelves and spot an identical server.

&gt; yzbot ""There, try that one. It's the same model.""

&gt; intern ""No, that won't work either.""

&gt; yzbot ""Oh? You tried?""

&gt; intern ""No, but it will only do RAID 8, just like this one.""

My brain attempted to process RAID level 8 but short circuited instead. I kind of just stared back at him.

&gt; intern ""I need a server that can hold 10 drives for RAID 10""

It took a little more questioning at what he was trying to accomplish. I learned that my intern associated RAID levels with the number of disks you use. He had been setting up RAID 5 with 5 disks, and RAID 6 with 6 disks, and just connected the dots right to RAID 10. I made sure he got a little more hardware tech time after that.

That set aside, I would love to work in ""a small group"" to learn these things from actual professionals who know what they're doing.  It's the ""independant"" part that is scaring me.

Some of these things I can understand, like the basic sysadmin stuff, knowledge of OSs, communication, etc.  For such a low wage, I can't believe I am expected to know all these other things.  I thought IT generally had high-paying salaries.

Google pays the best and has good intern program but I'm having second thoughts about the manager I host matched. Everyone also says google is nerdy and Im not about that.

I'm an American doing my Masters in Computer Science abroad, and I'd like to do a summer internship back home if possible. The problem is that my 3-month summer break goes August - October, instead of June - August.

Can I apply for regular summer internships and just note my weird availability in my resume and cover letter? Or is that too far off the normal summer schedule to bother? Do I need to mention that I'm a US citizen (or at least ""authorized to work in the US"")?

Thanks! :)"

Where am I? What time is it? It's extremely dark but I can still see structures. Wait, I recognize this place... It's my room. I looked at the window. It's dark outside. I am sleeping, or at least I was.
Where's my phone? I reached to my nightstand, I grabbed my phone and turned it on. The bright light from it blinded me for a few seconds. It's 5:02, I am not supposed to wake up until 7 o'clock. I just got an internship in a bank for the summer, and today is my first day. I should probably go back to sleep.

5:34

I am still awake. I hate it when this happens. I always end up falling asleep just before 7 o'clock. It's fucking frustrating. Not today, today I am going to get out of bed right now and do something, I don't care what it is. I turned on the light in my room. It's quite messy. I should tidy up a little bit.
 I opened the door. My father is still asleep, which is strange since he always wakes up at 5 o'clock. I have been living with him ever since him and my mother got a divorce five years ago. I hated my life ever since, but I have learned to live with it. He sometimes brings his girlfriend to the house, I always find things missing every time they get busy in his bedroom, mostly money, occasionally a watch... my fucking watch.

5: 37

I noticed that I had an erection. I smirked, comforting myself about the size of my genitals like every other teenage boy. I had to go to the bathroom. Where are my flip flops? Ah Fuck it.
I walked barefoot to the bathroom. I looked down, I could barely see my feet, it was really dark but I knew my way around the house. As I opened the bathroom door, I rose my head only to be confronted by my own reflection on the mirror. It scared me for a second. I shook my head smiling, I have watched so much horror movies that I am not easily scared, and being scared by my own reflection has always been a comical to me... I was wrong.

5:39

I looked at myself in the mirror. I had a stubble. I wonder if I will be able to grow a full beard one day. I still had to go to the bathroom. I lifted the toilet seat and sat down. I left my phone on the night stand. Shit. I had no means of entertainment, so I took one square of toilet paper and started messing with it. I was constipated. This is going to be a long one.
My parents had to split everything, the house where we all lived for almost 10 years, and their children too. My sister, who's 5 years older than me, moved in with my mother. My father and I moved into a house that belonged to his father, the first days weren't easy, but then again, I learned to live with it. 

And now, a year later, It's a place I can call home.

5:52

Finally, I am done. Note to self: never eat Fava Bean Puree right before sleeping. I cleaned up and pulled my pants up. I looked at myself in the mirror again. I had a stubble. I am doing an internship at a bank today. I better shave. I grabbed my shaving gel and razor. Wait, this isn't my razor, this is dad's. Where's mine? I couldn't find it. I went to the cupboard. There is was. I don't remember leaving it there. It smelled weird, some kind of perfume. I went back to the sink, put the gel on my face and started shaving.

5:54

Ouch, I cut myself. I usually have very steady hands. It's not a big deal. as the blood ran down my neck, I looked at my reflection. I don't know what was so appealing, but I couldn't stop looking. It just looked... alive. I know it was my face, but my reflection looked like a stranger I just met. It was looking at me. He was looking at me. It looked like it was about to speak. I don't really know how to explain it but it wasn't me. And that's when it happened.
He winked at me.

5:55

I froze. What the fuck? Am I hallucinating? What the fuck? I am sure I didn't wink, I think I would know if I did.
The silence of the situation made it worst. My heart pounded, I could hear it and feel it in my ears. I was afraid, I didn't move.
But my reflection did. He raised his arm, razor in hand. He didn't blink, he didn't break eye contact. 
I was terrified, paralyzed by my own fear.
I couldn't feel my limbs
He then proceeded to open his mouth, and slowly ran the razor down his tongue...
Slowly ran the razor down my tongue, again and again and again and again and again.
I blacked out. Never have I felt this much pain. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I felt a liquid, a mixture of blood, tears and saliva run down my chin, my neck and on the inside of my shirt, I could feel it on my torso and stomach like a water fall. I could hear the drops hitting the sink. I could hear every drop as if it was a church bell. I was not controlling my body. Why was this happening to me? What have I done to deserve it?

5:59

I felt weak. I had lost so much blood. My hand was still making the same movement. Those few minutes of torture felt like days. My tongue was no more, I was sure of it.
I could hear the blade hitting by bottom teeth.
Suddenly, the sound of the blade breaking echoed through the room. You can not imagine the relief I felt through all of the pain.
Now, I was digging through my bottom jaw with whatever piece of plastic I still had in my hand. I gave up, I guess deep down I didn't want to fight it. I hated my life anyway. I never had the courage to end my own life.
I felt my body give in to it's own weight. I fell to the ground. My face landed in a puddle of thick liquid. I was certain death was coming for me.

6:00

I was loosing consciousness. I heard the muffled sound of a door opening.
*I want to die.*
Noises, faint sounds. That was all I could hear.
*I just want to die.*
My name. I could hear it.
*Please let me die...*

Later, much later.

I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't talk. A nurse came in, checked the monitors next to my bed. She quickly left the room, I tried to call out to her but my mouth was full, and I was drugged up. I slowly closed my eyes.
Suddenly, two people rushed into my room. A man I assumed was a doctor since he was wearing a white coat, and... my father.
I was glad he was there, unlike other days before. The doctor told me not to try to talk until the surgery to replace my tongue and fix the damage I had done to my lower jaw. 
My father had tears in his eyes. He apologized to me for not being there for me when I needed him.
I never told anyone what I saw. I pretended it was a suicide attempt, because actually telling the truth would've probably landed me in the loony bin.
A year later, here we are. Everything went back to normal, my father never told anyone about what happened except my mother and my sister.
I was talking to my sister about the incident, and she said that mom couldn't handle another tragedy like this. When I asked her what she was talking about, she looked at me with a look of grief.

In 1994, my mother had premature labor. Upon her arrival at the hospital, the doctors did everything they could.
She was pregnant with twins. Only one survived."

Two years ago, I started at my first internship  at a startup in Silicon Valley as a software engineer. This was the first time I wrote production code that was affecting real customers. Like many of you here, my mind was flooded with self-doubt and fear. I felt that I wasn’t good enough, and was very nervous about everything I wrote. It had to be perfect; it had to stand up to the scrutiny of the other “real” engineers.

My first few months were rewarding, but also excruciating. I was endlessly obsessing over my work and worrying about tiny, inconsequential details. Each day, I worried that I would be discovered and fired because I wasn’t good enough.

In other words, I had the Imposter Syndrome. It drove me crazy.

A few days ago, I suddenly realized that I no longer feel that way anymore. Certainly, I cared about the quality of my work, but I am no longer obsessed, crazy, about minute details and afraid of criticism. Looking back, I credit this change to one mindset shift: I compared myself to myself, instead of watching the success of others.

I made it a habit to review code that I wrote two weeks ago and identify areas where I can improve. I collected a list of things to learn, articles to read, and set time aside to study these every day. While I was not following any specific metrics, I was tracking my productivity, code quality, and kept an eye on number of production issues to monitor my progress.

Each day was a small success. I stopped comparing my day-to-day reality with the highlight reel of the rockstars in the industry. I watched/shadowed/pestered other engineers in the company, and made sure that I was getting better each day.

I stopped comparing my beginning to other’s prime.

You are supposed to cringe at code you wrote many months ago. If you don’t, you are not growing. Now go out there and code your ass off."
2m6ted,2,2014-11-13,Advice for a graduate student with a very real possibility of flunking out,DomPerignon24,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2m6ted/advice_for_a_graduate_student_with_a_very_real/,"Hi everyone,

Just as a bit of background, I'm a 26 year old with a BA in political science who took some CS courses towards the end of my undergraduate years and felt that software development was a much better fit for me than going into law school. All the advice I received at the time was not to double major or change my major, but to go for a master's degree in CS instead. So I applied for the graduate program after graduation and was accepted since I already had all the prerequisites.

My first semester was last fall and unfortunately I stumbled and ended up on academic probation. I did far better this past spring semester,  but my GPA is still below the program's 3.0 minimum and I was told this was the last semester I could bring it up to a 3.0 before facing possible expulsion. Which I wasn't too concerned about until earlier this semester. Some miscommunication with the school about whether I was still going to be registered for classes this semester (it was over financial aid issues) lead to me falling a good deal behind in my two courses.

Long story short, there's a very real chance I don't get the minimum A and B needed to get off probation and I'll be expelled from the program after this semester.

Any advice on what my next steps should be if that comes to pass? Should I try going to another school (is that even possible after flunking out somewhere else)? I've been working on some personal projects, mostly some mobile apps I've written for my convenience. Though because of my job's policies towards employees writing software, I can't actually publish it to GitHub or anywhere else, so I figure it's a good idea to simply let employers know in my cover letter that I have projects I'd gladly show them. Even with a portfolio, I also know without a CS or similar degree, it's much harder to get my foot in the door career-wise. I've also been applying for internships, though if I flunk out, I don't see how I'd even have a chance at getting one since they're mostly aimed at students from what I've been seeing.

Thanks for any advice."

I mean, yes, he was born in Washington, D.C., so it would seem logical for him to wind up working for the government in some form or another.

But working for the President of the United States? Being employed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?

C’mon.

Most people think jobs at the White House are exclusively reserved for Ivy Leaguers, geniuses, or people with privileged upbringings or “special connections.” Despite not falling into either one of those categories, John was able to land a full-time job as a White House Staffer by the time he was twenty-three years old.

Officially, John worked as a Writer in the White House Office of Presidential Letters and Messages during the Clinton Administration.

Unofficially, he was a speechwriter for Bill Clinton…

For those of you who watched The West Wing, Rob Lowe essentially played John’s character for an episode (if you don’t think that’s cool, we’ll never be friends).

What was it like for John to work in the Clinton Administration at the White House? Intoxicating. Demanding. Frustrating at times.

But that’s a story for another day.

Today, we’re going to analyze the biggest question of all: how was he able to land one of the most competitive and coveted jobs in the world?

To find out, we reached out to John via telephone to ask him questions like, “How did you think it was possible to work at the White House?” and, “How did you beat the most qualified candidates in the world for your first job?”


**How John Corcoran got a job at the White House**

John was twenty-one years old when he began working as an unpaid intern in the Speechwriting Office at the White House.

He got the internship by going through the run-of-the-mill application process.

“I had no connections to leverage when I landed my internship.” He told me.

“No professor reached out on my behalf. I learned that it was a realistic possibility to work there due to the sheer number of interns they were taking in those days, so I applied and got it.”

About halfway through the summer, John became completely enchanted by his surroundings. There was no doubt he wanted a full-time gig at the White House. But where do you even begin strategizing about how to land one of the most competitive jobs on the planet?

For the next few months, he basically moved into the Presidential Library – scouring old, historic speeches from the likes of Kennedy, Roosevelt, Reagan, Lincoln, and Washington, often just looking for one quote that he could give to another writer.

Eventually, he started to gain the trust and respect from several senior staffers, but he struggled to prove himself as a writer. His big break came to him when he was asked to write a speech for the President to be delivered at a ceremony honoring the mens and womens NCAA basketball champions of the previous year.

It was the kind of opportunity that has your stomach twisting into knots – especially when you consider that John had little knowledge about college basketball and Bill Clinton could have rattled off team stats like The Schwab. 

But without a hitch, John delivered. He handed his boss the speech. After the speech was approved, it was delivered by the President. It was a big success. John was starting to make a name for himself.

There were no available full-time jobs at the White House when John graduated from college so he opted to take a job for Dreamworks. Dreamworks was a blazing-hot company located in Hollywood and founded by Steven Spielberg. John recounted the company being, “Like the Tesla Motors of its time.” He worked at Dreamworks for a few months before the call came.

One of his contacts at the White House, who John stayed in close touch with, called to tell him that there was an open speechwriting position. John’s friend informed him that he had put in a good word for him and to expect a call from the hiring director the following week.

John spent the entire rest of the week preparing for the forthcoming discussion like a madman, analyzing the current Administrative policy and whiteboarding his thoughts like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.


When the hiring director called, she introduced herself, asked a few basic questions, and requested John to mail her some writing samples (it was 1997). John obliged and said he would get them to her ASAP.

Then he paused and asked, “Do you happen to have today’s edition of the New York Times?”

“I do,” She replied.

“Well, I submitted a Letter to the Editor that you can find on the back page of today’s edition if you’d like to take a look.”

She opened the paper, read the piece while they were on the phone, and shortly thereafter told him to fly to D.C. for an interview the following week.

Son of a gun, I thought. How did he know? The day the hiring manager calls from the White House is the day his Letter to the Editor got posted in the NYT? Truly amazing.

“I bet the interview was cake,” I said, not withholding my arrogance.

He proved he was a top performer to the hiring director. His network was working hard for him. The interview was hotter than two goats in a pepper patch. THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH.

He laughed. “The interview was not cake. No interview in the White House is ever cake – it’s the White House.”

The interviews, which that took place over the span of a day, were conducted by some seriously influential people. Talk about pressure.

Like he imagined, the interviews were very challenging.

But as you know, he got the job. He was hired to work for the 42nd President of the United States.

John Corcoran will tell you that he’s not a genius, he doesn’t have an Ivy League background, and he didn’t have a strong connection with the hiring director. He never had an “in.” He just made one for himself.


**Behind the curtain: The Inner Workings of getting a job at the White House**

I’m beyond ecstatic sitting here writing this. It’s not often you get the chance to tell such a cool story.

But what’s so fascinating about John’s story is that it offers a blueprint for getting any ultra-competitive job you’ve ever dreamed of having.

Google, Facebook, ESPN, a bank in Zurich (am I the only one?) – it doesn’t matter. The subtle secrets he uncovered are repeatable when searching for a job in any industry and at any company.

To show you, I’ve prepared a Robert Greene style analysis for you (Robert Greene). That’s right, we’re going to take an in-depth look at the specific strategies and tactics John used to beat the job search process and land his White House gig. Some strategies might be more obvious than others but each played a crucial role in the ultimate outcome.

Let’s dive in.

**5 strategies John used to land a job at the White House**

**1) Get your foot in the door.**


&gt; “I wouldn’t have gotten a job at the White House if I wasn’t an intern first.” – John Corcoran

If you want to punch me in the face for writing this tip, I don’t blame you. I used to hate this cliche as much as you do.

But hear me out for a second.

If you want to get a job at your dream company, starting at an entry level position can be a very effective way to get your foot in the door. Why? Because it’s immensely easier to get in at the ground level than it is to compete for a mid-level position. By volunteering your time for free (or virtually free), the company has a very low stake in you. You might not be in your dream role yet, but…it gives you an opportunity to prove your worth and use that as leverage when seeking other positions.

Entitled people will scoff at this recommendation. They’ll think, I’m too overqualified to be an intern or to take an entry-level position.

If you are gunning for a particular job that’s highly coveted and you are looking for a way to create an unfair advantage over others competing for the same job, taking an entry-level job can create long-term benefits that far outweigh the obvious short-term drawbacks associated with it.

There’s also another subtle advantage of coming in at an entry level position: because the expectations of your work are lower (you are just an unproven intern working at a low cost), imagine the opportunity this situation offers to wow an employer. I call this “The Contrasting Effect,” where the contrast between the employer’s expectations and the employee’s actual performance is so vastly different that the employer is blown away and immediately views the employee as indispensable.

**2) Do exceptional work**


Let’s be brutally honest here: even when you get your foot in the door at your dream company through an internship, chances are very slim that you’ll convert the internship into a full-time offer if you’re not really good at something. It’s just the nature of high competition.

Most people will freak out and spiral downward into a pit of depression after reading this because they’re not an “expert” at anything. Take a deep breath. Most people in their 20s and 30s aren’t experts.

What I want you to know is this: you can develop in-demand skills quicker than you might think.

I’m not going to tell you to pull all-nighters, to sacrifice your social life, netflix shows, etc. That’s like trying to bench 245 pounds without having lifted in a year. It’s unhealthy and unrealistic.

Instead, the answer is to focus on building a habit. You do this not by overextending yourself, but by starting small, being consistent, and taking your focus off of short-term results.

When John started as an intern he slowly replaced the default menial behaviors associated with the job such as fetching coffee and answering phones with studying, writing, and editing speeches. By the end of the summer, his new habit had built up a ton of momentum and he actually looked forward to his late-night library sessions at the White House. In the process, he developed a habit, which helped him become an exceptional writer.


**3) Build relationships, not connections**


Imagine you walk into a party and you see a family friend.

It’s been years since the last time you’ve spoken, but as soon as you see him/her, you talk as if no time has passed. The conversation flows; there’s no agenda. You know if you needed something (like an introduction for a job), he or she would help you. This is a healthy relationship.

Now you walk into the same party and see a high school friend. It’s been years since you’ve seen him or her. You haven’t done a good job keeping in touch. You begin to talk and you’re already bored. The conversation feels like you’re pulling not one, but all of your teeth out. This is a connection.

Somewhere along the way, someone dropped the ball. Maybe there was no follow up. Maybe there was never mutual interest. The momentum of this initial connection never built up enough strength to form a relationship.

So, how did John build relationships in the White House?

He added value to the other person without asking anything in return. When he would browse the newspaper or different magazine articles, he would keep in mind some of his contacts. Anytime he came across something interesting or helpful, he’d mail them out. This showed a genuine, unconditional interest in the other person.

&gt; Bar story: Bill Clinton apparently does the same thing with crossword puzzles. He’ll see a clue that reminds him of a connection and then he’ll send them the puzzle. Imagine receiving a crossword clue saying, “Made me think of you…” from Bill Clinton. Yeah.

He stayed in touch and followed up frequently. So few people follow-up, yet is a crucial piece to building and maintaining relationships. If you’re not sure what to say, then you’re focusing too much on the outcome. Offer a personal message, ask them how their last quarter went, give them an update on you, or sprinkle in an article they might like.


**4) Play a different game (be unique)**


Differentiating yourself doesn’t mean you have to speak ten languages or have a triple major in college, it just means you have to strategically think about how you’re positioning yourself to your dream company.

John went to work at Dreamworks instead of working on Capitol Hill. He explained, “I could’ve gone and worked on the Hill. That’s what everyone was doing. But I didn’t. I wanted to be different so I took a chance.”

Some people might view pursuing a job in an industry might move him further away from his ultimate goal. But by playing it safe, especially in a competitive landscape, you are evening the playing field.

In the dating world, a guy choosing to go to a bar/club to meet attractive girls is evening the playing field. That’s where every guy goes to meet girls.

In your job search, submitting your resume through a company’s website AKA “the front door” is evening the playing field. That’s how the entire world hunts for jobs.

What is everyone else doing? How can you be different? Find an advantage. Take a risk. Play a different game…


**5)Beat inexperience by doing the work upfront**


Once you get in front of a VIP, you have the chance to eliminate inexperience as a reason for them not to hire you. In other words, you have the chance to PROVE that you are experienced.

The rule is: The more time you spend preparing upfront, the greater the odds you’ll get hired.

The people who don’t want to do the work offer platitudes like they’re “A natural interviewer”  or they’ll complain, “I don’t have enough time.” These people are either lazy, disillusioned, making excuses (or all of the above).

John did the nitty-gritty work. He did deep research, internalizing the small details of the Policies of the Clinton Administration. When it came time for the job interview, he investigated his interviewers like the Secret Service investigated him. He used this knowledge to quickly build rapport.

And he even went the extra mile by writing a letter to the NYT.

“The day the piece appeared and the day she called, that was serendipity. There was definitely some luck involved but I knew she was calling that week. I had a one in five chance. I took a risk but it was calculated.”

The point is: 90 percent of the work was done before he walked into the interview room.

The interview may not have been cake (c’mon, it’s the White House), but his preparation won them over."

The only worthwhile project I can put on my resume is [this](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/PHP-HTML.1/HTML-Template-Generator-Utility.html). The only project I've done for a programming class is simple command line utility with a lot of classes/polymorphism/object oriented stuff.

Since I can't raise my gpa until this semester ends at the end of January and can't really get work experience in any way, I want  to try and build up a portfolio of projects to put on resume and apply to different companies.

I'm just wondering, If I apply now but one month later I have some more projects and a more impressive resume can I just apply again? How long should I wait. Two months?, three months?

On an unrelated note I need idea for projects and want to know what kind of projects people who have landed good internships have got on their resume. Right now I'm working on a website and learning django+python while making it but I don't really want to go into web-dev.

Also how on earth to I find a github desktop application that I can contribute to? Everything on github is some sort of abstract framework or too massive and complex for me."

Some background: I was the only programmer on my schools robotics team all 4 years. I had never programmed before. When I said I'd program I figured I'd have a mentor holding my hand. Anyways. After the 3 weeks it took to go through a c++ textbook, I was able to write a crappy program that worked. I got the robot to move based off joystick input. Then that summer and fall I dove in. I rewrote my first robotics program about 3 different times, applying new knowledge I acruded each time. 

Then I got into computer vision. I've actually co authored 2 papers with a mentor from boeing. The content of the paper was all his, I simply coded it all up to be honest. Then he left me to my own devices my senior year, and I'm trying to get my work from then published. 

A problem I have is that I have zero app development knowledge and that's what this company does. Nearly all my programming is mathematical (after you get the image from a camera, all it is is matrix manipulation and dfts.).

I'm not going to list all the different classes in my curriculum but I have a good understanding of things in the computer world.

I graduated but I have no confidence in my education and in my skills, only because I feel as what I posses (what I learned) is not enough. I regret not applying for internships when I was in school, so I have no real life experience. Instead of applying for an internship I just went to summer classes non stop to make up for a year I lost.

I have no idea where to go with my degree, I feel like it's wasting away, I feel so guilty not having a job after this long especially living in Houston the oil business capital and other tons of jobs. I really enjoyed network architecture when I took it that I felt like this was one of my strongest skill that I started studying to be CISCO certified but man its taking me so long, and I know Rome wasn't built in a day but I keep asking myself if me learning all this CCNA stuff from almost the beginning really worth it? should I rather be improving my coding skills like learning C# which is totally new to me, or web development (Java Script). I graduated but the confusion has never hit me so hard, harder than my hardest project when I was first learning data structures. 

I look at these job posts and I look at the requirements which say things like C#, Visual Basic, and Oracle, J2EE/EJB Application Server, and other jargon. I hardly see things I know I always feel like I wont measure up to what companies expect lacking the confidence and knowledge. Even for a IT, CCNA certification will help but I'm really thinking if that would be enough.

I would say I really wish I could do something with database management, yet what do I study or do to get a shot working with databases? 

Having said all of this... what's the word? for those in the CS field what words of wisdom or advice can you share to me. What should be my play? go back to school? learn C# advance what I know if so, how? Buy text books and study different languages? By the way how is it working as a software developer, software engineering was my last class before I graduated, really enjoyed it made a 5 by 5 by 4 tic tac toe game with my group using java. I'm curious what is a normal day for someone working on computer development or IT.

2m8dak,10,2014-11-13,My job odyssey..,jobthroaway786,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2m8dak/my_job_odyssey/,"This is the very real story of how I landed a job at an extremely prominent law firm as a patent administrator. 

It's something I've wanted to get off my chest, and at the same time perhaps someone can benefit from it. By no means is the job that I have landed a super-high paying job, but is def a step in the right direction. 

About 5 years ago I dropped out of a top 10 engineering school where I was studying electrical engineering. The reasons why I dropped are irrelevant, but what is important that I had 3 years of credits. 

After dropping out I worked at a civil engineering firm. I mostly did QA/QC (quality assurance and quality control) on engineering and CAD drawings, at $17 an hour on contract. 

Whats important to realize is that the reason there were jobs in civil engineering at the time, was partially due to the American Re-investments Act. This is where billions of dollars were poured into public infrastructure projects. This is why a number of companies popped up. 

After doing this for 3 years, the public money dried up. My hours were reduced, and I had months of no work. I realized that this was the ceiling of my so called career. I was never going to move up. I needed to find a different path, and going back to school was not really an option. 

I asked around. People mentioned IT, SAP, real estate. But nothing grabbed my attention. I didn't want to be part of a boom bust career. I heard of guys making $50 an hour doing SAP. But it all was under really shady circumstances. (Something like, they apply for the job using someone elses resume, and you would do the work, and they take off the top). 

After looking for a few months, I got in touch with an old college friend who was now a patent examiner. I didn't know much about patent law, but I was intrigued. It seemed like a niche field, something people weren't flocking too, and overall stable. After a brief search I found out that senior patent paralegals were making anywhere between 60-70k/year. 

Initially I couldn't find anything. But eventually I got an unpaid internship, with my university working as a legal assistant. To survive on this, I got an overnight job working at a gym. I would be talking to lawyers and inventors by day, to wiping sweaty gym equipment and mopping vomit by night. 

After the internship ended, I worked as a patent searcher. Again this paid about $9 an hour. But I had learned alot, and I was desperately applying for patent paralegal positions, and patent secretary positions, even IP docketing jobs. 

Nothing. For 6 months I was barely surviving. I must have sent 1000s of applications. Barely any call backs. Rarely any interviews. Absolutely no offers. 

Depression set it. I became un motivated. Put on some weight. Cigarettes, weed, and occasional hard drugs. Everyone told me that patent law was not for me. During that time, I tried doing Uber. But I had too many tickets. Every door seemed to slam shut. 

I had a choice to make. Either double down on patent law, or forget about it. I doubled down. 

I expanded my job search. I was in the mid-west, so I started applying to california, and seattle, and DC. Surprisingly, I was getting call backs. People were taking interest. But no one was willing to interview/much less offer over a video conference. I had to be there in person. 

Moving out without a job seemed impossible. I would need atleast 3 months to get something. I started searching for places to live where it would be ridiculously cheap. And then, I came across a reddit post on r/sandiego. 

A kid was commuting to San Diego State University, from Tijuana. wtf..
I looked into it more. And yea, a shyt ton of people were doing it. Stupid low rent. Make money in dollars, spend in pesos. 

I was desperate, so I packed my bags, grabbed my balls and got on a stupid cheap southwest flight for $116. I landed in San Diego airport, with bare essentials and a few dress clothes, and crossed the border. I speak no spanish. But I roamed around and asked for places to rent. I told them my budget was under $200.

In a matter of hours I found a dirt cheap place, four walls no wider than a queen sized bed in a hacienda owned by an ex-porn producer. Hookers, acloholics, drugs, were the daily routine in the place. I locked myself in the room, and fired away job applications with a california address. 

The interviews started coming in within the first week. I was applying to postings, and cold calling every law firm in the area. If there was an email I sent my resume, if there was a fax number, I faxed my resume, if there was a number, I called and begged for an email or a fax number. I was relentless. I had to land a job quick. 

One interview I had was 4 hours away. I went. 3 hours at the border. 4 hours up, 1 hour interview, 4 hours down. I had to do this twice. 

But, I got the job. Close to double than I had ever made in my life before. I was ecstatic. The gamble had paid off. It was a small law firm with no benefits, but who cares. A sense of relief overtook me. I wasnt crazy, I wasn't reaching for something that was too far. I gave a mental and emotional middle finger to all the nay sayers. And I called all the people who supported me with the good news. 

I worked that job for a year. Learned the ropes, took on additional responsibilities. Made myself invaluable. And after a year, started applying to the large law firms. 

Now I had too many interviews. And finally landed a top 10 firm job. 

As I transition to this infinitely well paying job that Ive ever had. Here are some valuable lessons that I've learned:

1) Never doubt yourself. EVER. Think about a plan, think again, think again, think again. But once you've made a plan, stick with it, and dont ever give up. ever. 

2) COLD FUCKING CALL: Most jobs exist in the mind of managers and partners, way before they make it onto job boards. Google map search all the businesses that could hire you, and go down the list. 

3) Revise, revise, revise: I cant stress this enough. Re-do your resume a thousand times. Find someone who is doing the job you want and beg and if you can pay them to take a look at your resume. This made a huge difference in my job search. 

4) Take risks: Where I was before california had a stupid high unemployment rate. Moving with very limited cash was a risk. But a calculated one. I had three months of survival. I got a job in three weeks. 

5) BE PERSISTANT: Interviewing is not enough. Follow up. Ask. Call. Email. Send actual mail. Yes the fucking postal kind. Trust me it works. 

6) High Energy: Think apple employees. Talk Like them, be like them. Smile during the interview. Even if its on the phone. Its the perfect mask for being desperate.

7) Believe: Fake it till you make it. Tell yourself that you will make it. Believe it. I told myself i will become a Patent attorney. Im a fucking high school graduate, college drop out. But based on where I am now, my employers are asking me to go back to school. 

TL;DR: I fucked up college, worked shitty jobs, but busted my ass, and now have a good job.

Last week, I was hired as a consulting intern at a local church office for multiple things, the biggest project being a network make over. We'll get to that later though, this post is just for day 2.

My first task was to setup the Mac Mini on the rack with OS X server. No problem. I was rolling smoothly until I needed to reboot the gateway and apply some remote connection stuff so I could remove the monitor and manage it from Starbucks or, hell, an airplane with WiFi. Since it was midday, I couldn't restart the gateway, so I made me some coffee and set about fixing meager problems, one of which being updating iPhones from iOS 6 to 8 WITHOUT deleting anything. Easy task, just had to update from the computers instead. Since I setup an Apple Caching server on the Mac mini, I could download  it to multiple computers with ease. After some droll tasks, I went home with a broken LACIE G-Drive and a rack mount monitor with a bad panel. I disassembled the G-Drive, formatted the Dual 1TB HDDs and verified them. Then I diagnosed the problem, a shorted SATA power connector. Easy fix, clip it, solder a molex and pop a molex -&gt; SATA power in there. Reassemble, viola done! Then I removed the panel from the monitor and replaced it with a crap panel. According to the IT guy on site, I completed more work than he had done the last month."

I'm used to hearing letter of intent, so I don't know if they're one in the same. Anyways, any suggestions on how to improve mine would be greatly appreciated!!!! 



I am writing this letter to express my sincere and serious interest in furthering my studies at the graduate level at XYZ State University. In December, I graduated from XYZ State University with a bachelor of science in zoology, focusing on ecology, as well as an additional degree in German. My experience both working at XYZ State and as a student led me to develop an interest in pollination ecology and ecosystem management. There I saw firsthand the high quality research and education that XYZ State offers, which has largely impacting my decision to pursue my masters here. For this reason, I hope to be able to conduct further research as a graduate assistant at XYZ State working with native plants and beneficial insects.

While attending XYZ State University, I took advantage of numerous opportunities to gain experience working with both research and agricultural systems. Working at the Student Organic Farm at XYZ State University was an integral part of my undergraduate experience, and where I first became interested in working with agricultural systems. There, I learned necessary tools for plant propagation and cultivation, skills that would be highly useful in working with this project. I gained research experience assisting with the ABC (ABC) project in the A Lab for two field seasons. Working with highbush blueberry, wildflowers, and pollinators piqued my interested in ecological restoration as well, and how landscape management could be used to optimize crop productivity. Although this project allowed me to become familiar with the pollinators of southwest XYZ’s agricultural systems, it also allowed me to see some of my theoretical classwork come to life. While studying environmental ethics and policy, my final project looked at ecosystem services with a focus on managed and unmanaged pollination services. This project encouraged me to critically think about some of the issues facing growers today and how economic and environmental factors must be ultimately considered when making management decisions. All of these experiences and opportunities ultimately led me to become impassioned to gain intercultural experience in this field, something I set out to achieve.

My decision to gain intercultural experience brought me to the BBB-Universität in BBB, where I am currently participating in a fellowship program promoting cross-cultural exchange. I’m using this time to further my research experience and knowledge in the field of agricultural ecology. In addition to studying agricultural science at the university, I’m also working on gaining experience in pollen identification and analysis. How pollen analysis can be incorporated into pollination ecology and contribute to research is a question I hope to delve further into this year. To further build upon my research experiences, beginning in February I will be assisting with the Garden project of the Agroecology institute for the University of BBB, where I intend to conduct independent research as well. This project will look at the relationship between pollinators, predators, and urban green spaces while also assessing community structure and richness. I look forward to working with arthropods in a non-agricultural setting and gaining additional perspective on arthropod communities. Additionally, I plan to focus on broadening my quantitative and statistical knowledge, something that I also hope to be able to do while in the graduate program at XYZ State. 

 Part of my desire to work with native plants and beneficial insects stems from my desire to call upon and hone some of the tools I have developed over the years. Being able to identify insect and plants in agricultural systems of Midwestern XYZ, effectively conduct field research, communicate scientific information to a broad spectrum of individuals, and collect data responsibly are all personal skills I believe would help me to excel as a graduate assistant. Although pursuing a graduate degree is a serious endeavor, both in terms of time management and research, my undergraduate experience adeptly prepared me to excel in such situations. While attending XYZ State University, I balanced my time between 2-3 jobs, numerous internships, and classwork. While doing this, I was able to maintain a 3.xx GPA, and during my last 4 semesters a 3.xx. Although my initial undergraduate performance may have been hindered by my overly full-schedule, over the years I developed the skills that allowed me succeed in the face of adversity. These skills I developed will help me to excel in the graduate program in XYZ State University. I hope that you will seriously consider me as a candidate for this graduate assistantship and I would be eager to further discuss my research interests with you. You will find my CV attached with reference information and GRE scores. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

2m9yp7,146,2014-11-14,My dad never had to look for a job,deerleader1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2m9yp7/my_dad_never_had_to_look_for_a_job/,"My dad never looked for a job in his life.  He never made any elaborate career plans, never saw a career counselor, never went to a job fair, never even wrote a resume!

Yet he had a fantastic career. He had a total of about 20 jobs in his life. He started as a technician, then became a product manager, and finally moved into senior management of a large company.

He never actively looked for any of those jobs. All of those jobs found him.

When he graduated from a technical college he heard from a friend that a local factory was looking for technicians. That was in 1964. So he simply knocked on their door. They said to him ""Let me see your diploma. Great! So can you start tomorrow?"". That is how simple it used to be! 

And from there, one job lead to another. 

When I ask him about his secret to his career success, he answers ""I did something I enjoyed doing. I always made sure I did an excellent job. I always made sure I got noticed.""  When I ask him ""Is that it? But didn't you need to actively work on building a career?"" he answers, ""No I was too busy doing my job! And I was constantly offered the opportunity to do a more challenging job. That was good enough for me.""

I feel like I live in a completely different universe. Life used to be so much more simple and intuitive. Everything has become soooo bureaucratic these days. 

Even the interview process for a low level position as a glorified data entry clerk has become a 3-month marathon. 

Sometimes I despair when I add up the number of hours, months, YEARS that I have spent on writing cover letters, filling out web forms, traveling to job fairs, devising career strategies, researching employers, attending resume writing classes, doing internships, going on self-discovery missions, going to networking events, getting certifications,  keeping my LinkedIn profile up to date, ...

And all for what? A series of underpaid, mediocre temporary jobs interspersed by bouts of unemployment.  Sometimes I feel like a such a loser compared to my dad.  He had achieved so much more at my age. Maybe because he didn't have to waste so much of his precious time on all that career bullshit. 

But I try not to blame myself too much for my job search woes. Neither should you. The job market has become fundamentally, chronically broken. The job search process, which used to be a simple matchmaking exercise (as it should be) has become an arms race of ridiculous proportions. We have taken it for granted. But we should remind ourselves what a heroic effort even the simplest job search is, when compared to the experience of older generations.

Because of my premed pursuits and the fact I had to leave the country immediately for military service I wasn't able to pursue internships and to top it off my gpa took a pretty huge hit making it difficult to apply for a lot of positions.

I'm unhappy here in Korea because of cultural differences (I lived in the united states for over 20 years) and I'm looking to make my way back to New York for personal reasons.  I'm basically looking for any opportunity whether job or internship that will allow me to return.

The most obvious conclusion I suppose would be to return to school and raise my gpa/find internships that way but I don't have the financial stability to pay for more school.

Is there anyone with similar experiences or that might have some insight on ways to find internships or job opportunities that provide sponsorship?  Are there any programs for non-u.s citizens that I might be able to look into for obtaining a work visa or green card?

2mbd4y,8,2014-11-14,May have just low-balled myself through a recruiter. Company will be contacting me today. What to do?,CSGuy6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mbd4y/may_have_just_lowballed_myself_through_a/,"A recruiter called me several weeks ago and asked for a bunch of information including my expected salary for my next job.

Apparently, I told her $65-70k, but I don't remember that. Anyway, some time goes by and I do well in a phone interview as well as an in-person interview with the company. The company calls me directly and mentions that my salary is $70k; I stumble a bit because I was actually expecting 90-100k. This is due to the fact that my expectations have changed a bit since I first had contact with recruiters after research.

So I call the recruiter and tell her that the number $65-70k is wrong. She says she will call the company and ask for and update or something.

I'm expecting a call in about an hour. What can I do to prevent myself from being low-balled?

Some notes: I'm a new college grad with two internship experiences and the area I live in is in East Bay California, near San Francisco.

Edit: The recruiter called back to say $85k is the best they can do, but after that there are no more negotiations. I still plan on negotiating for more. I agreed and said I'll consider it. Thoughts? My planned speech to the company: ""I know the market and I know the average pay for a software engineer in this area. I am asking to be paid fairly, nothing more nothing less. There are plenty of opportunities and even more to come. If $85k is the best you can offer... I cannot make any guarantees as to how long I will stay, as I know there are plenty of choices for me out there."" This might be a bit harsh, but I'm really trying to push for more.

More info: the company is a child company of a bigger parent company that is VERY big. Glassdoor lists the average salary of the child company to be around $80k, but the average salary of the parent company is $100k+. How much should I REALISTICALLY ask for?

Edit 2: It looks like my last counter-offer ($97k if you're curious) was approved! I actually didn't have to use my planned speech. They (through the recruiter) asked for a number that I would be willing to sign, no questions asked. I stated $97k; the third party recruiter said ""Wow that's a lot... that's more than what they allocated for this position and that's what they pay the senior developers. This will require them to write a letter to management and the VP for approval."" However, I was firm in my tone, even though I was very afraid at this point after hearing this. About an hour or two later, I get a call from the company saying they will approve the number, but the paperwork/offer is still being processed and will be ready on Monday. Cheers to a happy ending.

Thanks for reading!"

I noted one such tale [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1c6sp4/of_todays_work_foggystate/).  The other...well, sometimes, in IT, we have to deal with dust bunnies.

There are, here in the greater Seattle area, these used computer shops.  They take in old computers that are donated to them, clean them up, refurbish them, install software (Win7 Home Premium at the time, among other things), and sell them at discount prices.  Many such computers are handed off by a certain ""small and squishy"" company across the lake from one such shop, many of them come from the end user.

Most of the EU boxes get partsed out, separated, and disposed of for recycling.  The ones that survive a quick hardware probe^1, however, go through refurbishment - and the first part of that process is to crack it open, exterminate dust bunnies, and do a physical inspection for damage such as blown capacitors.

During my internship at this one location in Seattle, I was on dust bunny duty.^2

Mitigation, fortunately, was pretty easy - thanks to the use of an air compressor with a blower nozzle and a ShopVac attached to this box.  It was sort of like a combination of a paint box and an exhaust hood, had those clear vinyl strip-curtains in the front to prevent blowback.  On the back of this was a louvre that attached to the intake hose for the ShopVac, which dropped all of the dust into a clamped-on plastic bag and filtered for air out.

Or at least, that's what the assembly was *supposed* to do.  

My first time using this, I got a lung full of dust.  As I was an active smoker at the time, it didn't bother me *too* much, but that's an awful lot of dust.  OK, get the dust mask.

The next times using this, ti was easier breathing, but I came out looking like I'd been in a battlefield, minus the wounds.  So it was time to... troubleshoot!  

Quick observation of the blow-out hood indicated that dust was not suctioning out as fast as it could, which indicated either an obstruction in the intake, or a loss of suction somewhere.  Path traces are not dissimilar in scope to a layer one cable trace, so check the line to the plastic bag.

...which was not fully clamped on.  and boy oh boy, was that filter a mess!  

I took a few extra minutes.  Tapped out the filter, reinstalled it, clamped the bag properly, and blew out my next computer (one that was good and coated in dust) - and kicked on suction after I started the blowout.

You could hear the anguished squeaks of the dust bunnies as they got pulled into the black hole. 

tl;dr: Vacuums should suck, so as to exterminate dust bunnies - lest they become vorpal dust bunnies.

^1 in which we find out a) if they power on and b) what's inside.

I have worked as an intern at this company for 1.5 years.

They are a large international telecom.

I am located in the Midwest.

They want me to do development work.

They have said that they want to hire me(my manager has said so and I have recently spoken with HR where they told me about benefits).

My question is about where to start when it comes to salary negotiations.  I have no idea what number to even throw out there.  I've looked on the company's glassdoor page and for my area and it is ranging from $62k-$122k.  I have looked on Indeed and the average salary for a developer in my area(large metro) is $86k-$88k. Even the $62k sounds way too high to me.
  

Thanks for the help!"

I'm not sure how to proceed.,gradthrowaway01,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2mcj88/facing_sexual_harassment_from_a_recruiter_im_not/,"For background, I'm a female PhD student in a STEM program. At my department a lot of major companies recruit for summer internships and jobs in my field and the internships are very important for future employment opportunities in the industry. This past September, a recruiter--I'll call him Jim--from one of the companies called me on my personal cell phone (which he got from resume) and asked me out on a date and said some inappropriate things to me after my interview. I said no, of course, and told him that I was happily in a long term relationship of 5 years and asked him to leave me alone. I was never explicitly promised an internship with the company, but he hinted that he would put in a good word anyway, even when I told him not to. 'Jim' texted me for a few weeks, but I didn't respond and I thought that was the end of it. I did end up getting an internship with 'Jim's' company, but I turned it down and went with another  company that also offered me a place because the whole situation felt very weird. 'Jim' stopped trying to contact me and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't report the situation to anyone because I thought I had taken care of it.

This past week, the same company 'Jim' works for invited about 15 people from my department (professors and students) for dinner. I went because one of my advisors asked me to go and I didn't think it would matter much as I doubted 'Jim' would be there. Well, I was wrong. He cornered me while I was coming back from the restroom and said some really inappropriate (sexual) things to me along with telling me that I had been invited because he had pulled strings and he really wanted to see me again, that I should be thankful to him, that he'd talked to his bosses and they would still give me a placement, etc. I tried to be civil, but I was incredibly angry at this point and I just left the dinner. 'Jim' has been texting me and has tried to call me a few times since then. Right now, I'm ignoring it until I can figure out what my next step should be.

I've never returned any of these advances nor have I given 'Jim' reason to think that I would return his feelings. The company is one of the largest in the world and fund quite a bit of research in my department (luckily not mine). My department relies on them and the recruiters are important to the departmental relationship with the companies as they're alumni from the school (usually). They give the department quite a bit of money for a lot of things, actually. I'm also in my first semester and just came to this school so I'm worried about being seen as a trouble maker, I suppose. There aren't that many other females in my field and I've had to face things like this before, but it's usually been from peers. There's never been this huge power differential and I feel exploited. I've talked to my boyfriend and a few close friends about it and they believe I should first talk to my advisors (who I do trust very much) and then possibly the department chair, but I'm not sure. Has anyone out there been in a situation like this? I'm just not sure if I should report this or exactly how to navigate the situation. Any advice you could give would be really, really appreciated.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for responding to this. I know I haven't responded to everyone, but I have read each comment and I thought I would post an edit with what happened today. I called my advisor today and met with him about it after waking up this morning to some other lewd and pushy text messages. I decided it was the last straw as obviously this man is not taking ""no"" for an answer. My boyfriend was able to get back all of the text messages I had deleted from when this first started in September and I showed them to my advisor. He was absolutely livid, but luckily *not* as over-reactive as I was afraid he would be--and called the department chair who then contacted people within the company as well as a few administrators on campus. Even the department chair--who is friends with 'Jim'--was angry and very supportive, especially since I had documented proof. I'm having to file a formal complaint to the company right now and on Monday I also have to meet with my school's Affirmative Action Office (and possibly Student Affairs) to file another complaint. The people at the company with whom I spoke were also supportive so my fears were hopefully unfounded. I'm not sure what the end result of this will be, but hopefully it will stop 'Jim' from doing this to anyone else. If anyone  ever has anything happen to them  like this (or are going through something similar) my best advice is to document everything and speak up ASAP. I wish I would have told someone what was going on sooner. Get familar with your university's sexual harassment policies, even if you don't think you will ever need them. I also learned a lot about university wide sexual harassment policies and there are always people on campus who can help which I honestly wasn't that aware of before. "

I am a 27 year old male, originally from Michigan. I have lived in Nevada, Colorado, Colombia, Korea, and the Philippines before. I was in Manila in 2011-12 for a short-term internship, and am finally looking to return!

I absolutely loved it there and I never felt more comfortable or at home than I did there. 

So I am basically looking to find a person or two who wants to join. I would be looking for an apartment in Makati or the Fort Bonifacio areas. Both are fairly central to nightlife and different event centers. 

I am an avid soccer player/enthusiast, a gamer, a traveler, and I enjoy music and film as well. I am super easy to get along with and take care of what is mine. Looking to find someone who won't struggle to pay their part of the apartment. Working remotely would be sweet, but not a requirement. I do a lot of freelance work. Writing and some web dev stuff. I also would be looking to potentially gain employment in Manila in the tech industry. 

I will be definitely traveling throughout the islands in my free time, as well as playing soccer with some old friends on a regular basis. 

If you think you'd be interested, let me know! xD"

The company I work for was part of a recent acquisition that guaranteed us at least one year pay after the merge.
Additionally I am new to the company (first post college job but did 9 months of internships with them) and part of my agreement was that I have to pay back any relocation fees if I leave within the first year. The end of my first year is coming up in February and it is additionally a yearly leadership development rotational program that would mean I would be changing roles around that same time so I worked with the new company to have my start date after that year period.

For giving notice I would like to give it sooner than later so that they can back fill the role they expected me to take properly but I was wondering if I tell them sooner can they ask me to leave sooner than I planned and then be stuck with $10k in moving costs?  The moving costs are what the first company paid for when I first started that I may owe back.

I worked for them as an intern during summer 2013, and within a few weeks of the completion of the internship, I was offered a full time, salaried position upon my completion of school.  

I started in July, and was just recently laid off, along with 20% of the workforce due to a company downsizing.  I was offered roughly 4 months of severance pay, if I accept the agreement, and waive them of all liabilities. 

The reason I am curious about implied contracts though, is and while I was working full time, I was considered a ""New Grad"" and they talked quite a bit about their rotation program. (The rotation program was where we would rotate and do 3 different jobs (with different titles) and work on 3 different teams over the course of 3 years).  Nothing official was ever laid out or signed, but there were many emails referencing it, power point presentations that described the benefits of it, mentions of it during goal setting, and countless conversations about it between recruiters, other new grads, managers, etc.  There were old files on their intranet that laid out the possible options for each rotation, how to get the most out of each rotation, how the process would work, etc.  Additionally, while I was an intern, there was a lot of mention of it, and they used it as a selling point of their company. 

I'm curious if I have a case.  Unfortunately, I no longer have access to most of the ""evidence"", since I was laid off unexpectedly and the day I was informed of my termination was my last day.  I have to decide fairly quickly since I either have to accept my severance, or give up my right to press charges against them. 

Finally, if I did press charges, how public would this become.  I work in a fairly tight nit industry, and the last thing I would want is to be unable to be hired again or discriminated against because I brought forward this case.

So last week I got an internship offer from a fairly well-known company in San Francisco. The friends I have told about the offer think I'd be crazy not to take it: they're offering $40+/hr plus a housing stipend/

However, my parents want me stay home this summer. This is because it's my only my freshman year and since I have CS experience they think it's only a matter of time before I get sucked into the San Fran rabbit hole and they want to see me. Since I'm from the East Coast and go to college in California, I sorta promised I'd go home summer after freshman year as one last summer at home. Plus, I'm from Boston, so it's not like there's nothing to do there during the summer there.

The problem is I have until Tuesday to accept or decline the offer. While I would love to spend potentially a last summer home with my family, the SF offer is so sweet. And, at the moment, I have nothing else lined up. I had a Google Eng Practicum interview last week, and they have interns in Boston, but I have no idea how that went.

I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 12, prior to that it was ADHD. I've had so many diagnoses, though the only fitting ones were GAD, Social Phobia, PTSD and Dysthymia. I've been hospitalized on multiple occasions for cutting and suicide attempts. I haven't acted on anything in about 9 years, but I've come very close, the most recent being back in September.

I have a very volatile relationship with my mother. A lot has gone wrong in my life because of her poor decisions- I was in a very abusive residential treatment center as a teenager for 8 months, and it has really fucked me up. I haven't trusted her since and I don't think I will ever be able to trust anything from her. She even recently sent me some money as a gift and I freaked out because I didn't understand why she was doing this- there had to be some reason behind it and I still don't trust it because yesterday she sent me an email trying to offer some suggestions and I didn't even want to answer it because I don't want to talk to her. I almost entirely cut her out of my life back in the spring, because we got into a huge argument that brought up suicidal thoughts for me and made me absolutely miserable. I didn't speak with her for two months. Yesterday made me freak out in the same way.

Every time something goes wrong, something bad happens (like a break up), or I get stressed out because of my mother, my mind resorts back to the same standing plan I have had for years as a way out. I am going to be seeing my mother at Thanksgiving and the thought is making me absolutely sick. I just wish I could fade from existence without anyone noticing so I wouldn't have to hurt other people. I have so very few friends in my life, and I've just connected with a guy that I really like but I get so scared when he doesn't answer texts or something. I can force myself to go to classes and my internship, but besides that I barely ever leave the house because dealing with other people is too exhausting. I'm afraid of getting those thoughts again."

Currently trying to decide between two companies. 

Company A: Older company, known throughout the 80s-90s as a massive player, but has since lost it's footing to the likes of the 'New age' companies. They're an International company that may or may not specialize in Business Machines.   
The job: Developing server side Java applets for existing infrastructure on one of their large products.   
The language: Java

Company B: THE Silicon Valley electric car company. Enough said.   
The job: Developing tools to improve existing software on the cars.   
The language: Python

I'm weary of company B because I'd be paid about the same, but have to live in the bay area. Also, I've heard they work you quite hard, which I'm fine with if I enjoy the work. Finally, it sounds a lot more like Data Analytics than software development. Haven't received the official offer, but I assume my title is Software Engineering Intern.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: My girlfriend points out that I've already conditionally accepted Company A's offer, but in their official offer email they say 'The decline offer button is available throughout'. Thought I might as well add that."

2mfm2y,3,2014-11-15,Life changes - need some advice,delicateglow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2mfm2y/life_changes_need_some_advice/,"Sorry if this is all over the place. I just feel the need to post it all.

I'm 22 years old now. I have only gotten my first part time job about a month ago. You may be thinking ""Seriously? 22 and you barely got a job?"" Well let me elaborate. During my 4 years in a community college, I spent my time doing my GEs. Aside from that, I did this technical theatre program that took 1.5 years to complete. During that time and another year, I was the stage manager for theatrical productions in the college. As a stage manager, you're pretty much spending loads of hours and hours there. It wasn't a paying position because I was a student. However, the experience was absolutely spectacular. 

After I ""retired"" from being a stage manager, I took up an internship to a company that provides production design, a stage, and a few minor other things for people who wish to film commercials. The internship wasn't as great. I spent essentially 90% of the time cleaning and organizing rather than learning. But it's still something I can put in resumes.

After I completed that, I received my two A.As for Fine and Performing Arts and Theatre Arts. I applied to a university to transfer to get my B.A in TV, Film, and Media. I don't start until Spring.

My parents have sheltered me a lot more than I have realized. I couldn't ever go out before College. I couldn't see friends, I couldn't stay longer than when school ends. I had to go straight home. When I opened up my own personal bank account a couple of years back, my parents said no to me getting a credit card. It wasn't until I start receiving my paychecks from this part time job that I decided to get a credit card. So basically I'm 22 now with no credit score and I believe it takes 2 years minimum to establish credit?

Because of my parents' parenting style, I had nothing to do at home but play online games, one in particular. I played this game so much I opened a site for the game and everything. The site wasn't popular but I enjoyed working on it. Any free time I had, I would play. It was my escape from my family. However it became more harmful than good. I've became addicted to it.

I've decided to completely stop gaming as of yesterday. I've deleted everything in regards to gaming. To me, this was a huge step. I've always said to my friends ""I'm quitting"" but I would still update my site with latest news of the game. But I would come back a month later. It may be a little overboard but I at this point, I'd rather have it completely gone than to moderate. Once I get my life in order, I'll think of moderating. Until then, I won't be thinking of that. As regards to my site, yeah, I'm closing it too. It's sad because I've loved this site so much. I've met many wonderful people but I can't continue it.

To add onto my parents sheltering me - I feel like the step in life I need now is to move out. It'll teach me a lot about finances and independent living. Though living in LA, it's tough to move out but I do have friends that would be willing to be roommates (one with a credit score).

Not only this but my job..isn't even a job. I'm getting less than 10 hours a week. I can't live with that pay. Nobody can. So I'm currently looking for another job but it's just so hard during this season. Majority of places aren't looking for people - they already have seasonals.

But the issue again is looking for a job. I want to move out. I know I wont be able to move out within next week - I know the whole save 3 months advance in rent, etc. But I want to start. It's just so stressful. Before landing my current job, I had applied to practically over 50 places. Got about only 4 interviews, all which I did not get a follow up or anything.

I don't know what to do reddit. I'm just so tired of everything. Any advice would be great."

Break social norms, read the textbook, social scene is poppin' but you need balance.

 
On with it.

It's 12:30am, I just studied all day for midterms, and I feel like rambling some things I wish people had told me before I transferred here. Before I start, I would like to invite Downvote Fairy to fuck off; this is for the children.

I first want to bring up my social experience here, because that has heavily dictated my ability to be a successful student. After I reminisce about my drunken nights of fucking random dudes from the track team (I’m kidding. Am I? I don't know.), I'll get to the main point: getting the fast-paced quarter system to lovingly and gently fellate you.

I was initially excited to have been accepted into UCI's School of Criminology, and then was quickly discouraged after conversations I had about my future educational endeavors. 

When I told someone ""HAY OMG IM GOING TO UCI TOTES SMART LOLZ"", the bastard would respond not with “Congratulations,” but with ""Ha. Have fun with all the Asians."" Okay, what in the actual fuck. Why does the heavy Asian influence---Okay, heavy isn't even the right word. The whole fucking school is Asian, but anyways...---- Why do the demographics of UCI have to dictate my college experience? That response from people never made sense to me, and the negative stigmata was kind of a buzzkill. I come from an affluent town north of Sacramento; everyone is rich, white, and rude, so I shouldn’t have been surprised that they would turn their noses up to my school of choice. It's not you, Asians, I swear. 
 
I was accepted early in May to UCI, graduated from my community college that same month, and then had a six month long summer packed of partying, sex, and anxiety. I drowned my nerves in so much alcohol that I cried tears of Vodka. I was scared shitless about moving to an unfamiliar area, especially to a far away town with a reputation of being dull. I wanted to know what I was walking into, so I started to investigate what the future would hold.

I started my research here on reddit; what I gathered was that UCI supposedly has *no*, and I mean *no*, social scene. I am a social butterfly, I need close interpersonal relationships with people to breath. I party. I meet people. Having a close connection to people is ancillary to my success in any environment. I was scared that I wouldn't have a single contact here in Irvine.  

I searched r/UCI for more information and found that this community was proving to be as cold and unwelcoming as the dickheads in my hometown said Irvine would be. If you click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/2d1fl5/uci_meet_and_greet_right_here_right_now/), you can see one of my first attempts to make a contact here, and it was met with surprising success. I decided to put myself out there, and low and behold I actually made a friend from that thread. There began my social life. My determination to disprove that Irvine is boring as fuck, was steadfast and unwavering. 

That one contact made here on reddit birthed an intricate social network including people from various walks of life. In a month I was invited to three fraternity venue parties, partied at the sorority houses, went to five different night clubs, partied in three different towns adjacent to Irvine, and met a group of people that I was quickly able to call family. Simply put, I chose to be open to what Irvine has to offer, and was able to find my life-source: friendships. 

For those of you who have asked “What’s the social scene like at UCI?” the answer is simple. It is what you make of it, it exists. Put yourself out there, don’t be afraid to break a social norms. (Saturday night of week 1, I was feeling particularly lonely, so I stuffed my purse full of beer and wandered around Camino Del Sol. I followed a trail of noise that led me to a party, and let myself in. I actually don’t recommend *this* tactic, because let’s be honest…that’s weird as fuck…but nobody is going to turn away a decently attractive college girl who is passing out beers indiscriminately. That’s how I met my best friend here in Irvine…by crashing a party and passing out alcohol.) 

That brings me to the main point: College isn’t all about having fun. A lot of parts are supposed to suck and be difficult. Having people to connect with can make it a hell of a lot easier, but there must be a balance. And to be perfectly honest, I was so focused on making my social life happen that I soon realized I wasn’t giving enough attention to school. A few academic fuckups, misaligned priorities, and social faux pas have taught me the following things.

1.	Read the fucking text book. This isn’t community college, and it’s definitely not high school. You need to spend hours outside of class studying. Is it boring? Too bad. Fucking read it. Every bit of knowledge you gain is powerful. How beautiful is it that we are creatures of independent will, and can think abstractly beyond instinctual action? Nurture your brain. Read that boring fucking textbook, it’s full of seriously cool shit. 

2.	TURN OFF YOUR FUCKING PHONE IN THE LECTURE HALLS. I did the math. If you go to one class twice a week for 10 weeks, you are paying $67 to attend that lecture. Don’t be a dickhead. Turn off your phone and listen to what the professor is saying. They might be shitty, the topic might be boring, but lecture are the same as textbooks. It’s an opportunity to learn something incredible.

3.	You don’t have to party every weekend. I really had a hard time wrapping my brain around staying in on a Friday night. My first thought every weekend was “It’s Friday. I’m home. I’m a fucking loser. Better wander around and find a party.” Welp, because I did that, I got a D- on my first university-level paper, and a 78% on my first midterm. 

4.	D’s (might) get Degrees, but they sure as fuck don’t open doors. Future scholarships, internships, fuck even some jobs, may all be dependent on your work ethic here at UCI. Make that transcript look more inviting than Kate Upton’s tits. 

5.	Getting dressed up for school is fucking pointless. This is just my opinion. But seriously, no way in fuck am I spending more than 20 minutes on myself to impress any of you. Sleep. For the love of god, just sleep in instead of spending 45 minutes on your hair. It’s fucking college. I wear what I slept in the night before to school all the time. So what if I look like ass. Sorry bout it.

6.	When you’re trying to study, leave your phone in another country. I go to Peete’s Coffee to study and I leave my phone in my car. That way I’m not tempted to text whichever dude I’m boning that week, and I actually retain the information from my textbook. The phone can wait. You're not that important, nobody needs to reach you 24/7. 

7.	Read the syllabus. Just read it. 

8.	If you’re struggling with a class, ask for help. This isn’t high school; a professor will not hunt you down to tell you “Hey, you’re sucking ass lately and this is how to fix it.” Be a proactive student. Is your shit lame? Then go to office hours and get some additional assistance. If you follow tip #7, you'll know when the best time to contact a TA/Professor to get the help you need.

9.	Make friends with your professors whenever possible. Kiss that ass. Make your presence known in that lecture hall of 360+ students. Rarely do professors actually grade your assignments, usually it’s the TA’s. So kiss their asses too! They’ll be more inviting and helpful if they know who you are.

10.	Feeling lonely, sad, depressed, stressed, etc? Decide to fix it. Accept that you feel like X, and actively change it to Y. Mental health is a slippery slope for students undergoing transition and academic/financial distress. If you’re feeling shitty, open up and talk to someone. Take care of yourself in every aspect. When you feel good, you do good, the world does good for you too. 

11. If you've just moved here, make your residence feel like *home*. I completely moved all of my furniture around and decorated my apartment. It's my space, I feel comfortable here, and having a place that feels like home helped me assimilate more easily. 

12. If you're fresh out of high school and this is your first time living on your own, be courteous to your roommates. Nobody wants to clean up your mess or deal with your shit laying everywhere. Think of other people besides yourself.

13. Know your limits with alcohol. Don't pregame too hard before a venue party. (Venue parties are usually hosted by Frats/Sororities at a *venue* like a nightclub or a bar. You pregame at the frat house, get piss drunk, then hop on a bus and ride to the destination). I've watched so many first/second years puking their fucking guts out before the party has even started. Bro, slow your roll. You don't need to get that hammered to have a blast.

14. Try to get as far ahead on readings as possible. Read chapters BEFORE class. This is common sense, but seriously. It's everything.

15. Fucking. Smile. Have inviting energy, be friendly, help people. For whatever reason, this is essential to getting through a full day of school. No resting bitch face. Be nice and the world will be nice to you. 

This concludes my midnight ramblings. I hope this helps at least one student.

**EDIT** I've received a few PM's, (mostly cool, one creepy as shit), so I would like to extend to anyone interested my hand in friendship. My name is Kaylan Jackson, you can find me on Facebook. Maybe I'll see you on campus.

And if you're anti-social media, then I guess you're fucked aren't chya. 

**EDIT 2** Thanks to the fuck who systematically downvoted all my shit. I'm still getting systematically laid. 

Maybe those two things aren't related, but I still feel like I've won."

2mgzdn,4,2014-11-16,Smart Cards,creamersrealm,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2mgzdn/smart_cards/,"Im curious as to what everyone's opinion are towards smart cards no days.

My company is considering some sort of two factor authentication for our Domain Admins which may go out to all of IT if the VP likes the idea. So far I have a working setup with enrollment certificates and logon certificates, the biggest problem I have discovered is how much physical security is needed for a Smart Card. For example if we had a rouge intern that went and took a admin's smart card he could go reset the pin and in less then 3 minutes have full domain access. I have some demo cards that are prox cards as well so we have a lesser chance of leaving them behind but the risk seems very high.

My question is how can I better protect the cards by not allowing pin resets if this is possible? One option was using biometrics such as a fingerprint instead of the pin code.

Has anyone implemented a two factor solution with 1 time codes such as using a smart phone or a RSA id? I thought if we could have a two factor solution such as RSA it would be more secure and still requires something you know plus something you have. If you left the something you have behind it would be 100% useless unlike the smart cards which would still be a risk."

Then I got involved in a quite complex thesis project where I once again programmed a certain algorithm. Now I'm doing my internship and lo and behold, I'm writing programs to help me get my experiment done. 

I'm starting to feel more interested by programming, than I am about cognitive psychology in general. At first it felt kind of dumb, but now I'm seriously debating with myself whether I should persue courses in information technology and change career paths. I just can't not program, and it's driving me nuts.

Would it be crazy to apply to internships for this summer? For context here are the classes that I have finished that are required for my major so far:

* Two intro courses to programming on Java
* A discrete mathematics course
* Calc I and II
* A data structures course that uses C++
* A course that gives a brief overview of several different languages. (Officially called ""Software Engineering and Programming Languages"")

And by the end of the spring semester I will have finished
* Computational Models
* Software Engineering
* Calc III

Basically pretty much every internship I am interested in says knowledge of languages that I have not been exposed to yet would be good. Do you think I would have enough time to learn these languages well enough for the internship by the time applications are due. (Most are due by the end of Feb)

My program does not enable me to have free summers, so I cannot visit my family in India. I have been thinking of getting an internship at MS in Hyderabad or somewhere in Bangalore (NVidia, whatever), so that I can both fulfill my requirements and also visit my family.

I'm graduated in May, recently got a full-time offer from Amazon, and was a Microsoft intern last summer.  Here's how I study for coding interviews:

EDIT: Here is a link to my CS review onenote:
https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=698BA9C208A5B31D!32719&amp;authkey=!AP1TevOlacebRns

I. Technical knowledge

A. Data structures - know internal implementation, classes for your chosen language, advantages/disadvantages, and Big O complexity for common operations for each of the following:

-Hash tables

-Binary search trees

-Linked lists

-Arrays

-ArrayLists

-Tries

-Queues

-Stacks

-Heaps

B. Algorithms

-Big O

-Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort

-Tree/graph transversal 

-Greedy algorithms

-Recursion

-Dynamic programming

-Divide and conquer

-String Builder class for your chosen language

-Proof by induction

-P vs. NP

C. Operating Systems

-Stack vs. heap

-Memory management (Garbage collector or manual malloc/free)

-Processes vs. threads

-Caching

-Call stack

-Kernel vs. user space

-Basics of internet stack

Data structures, algorithms, and operating systems were by far the most useful classes you took in school!


II. Coding practice

-You HAVE to code on a whiteboard!  It is very different from coding in an IDE or even in Notepad.  I spend a week and a half doing whiteboard coding questions out of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"".  Don't just memorize the answers.

-Make a good faith effort to solve each problem as you practice.  Also, think about the Big O complexity and where you can optimize.

-Finally, this is a great opportunities to memorize libraries/common data structure classes for your chosen language!  You don't get documentation or Stack Overflow during your interview.


III. Behavioral

-Come up with responses to common behavioral questions in advance: i.e., ""What is your biggest weakness?"" or ""Tell me about a time you had a conflict on a team"" or ""What is the most difficult technical challenge you have faced?""


IV. Experience

-If you put a technology on your resume, you may be asked about it!

-Review all your previous projects/work experience, so you can quickly and knowledgeably answer any questions that may be asked.

-Don't talk negatively about your previous/current job unless specifically asked.

-Cast everything in a positive light.  That project/job/coworker they just asked about might have sucked, but you look like an ass if you say that.


V. General tips

-You want to click with the interviewers.  In the back of their minds, they're asking themselves ""Would I have a beer with this guy/girl?"" or something similar.

-Dress appropriately.  I wore jeans and a button down for my last interview.  It's not good to show up in a suit if the dress code is casual.  Take a shower, comb your hair!

-Ask questions!  This is a two way street, both for the company to see if you're a good fit, and if it's a good fit for you.  Ask technical questions (what IDE/version control/languages/technologies does your team use?) and general company culture questions (what'd your favorite part of working here/how is the life/work balance?).

-Relax.  The interviewers aren't out to get you, and you can't think straight if you're nervous.

-If you get rejected, don't give up!  There will be another chance in the future."

Ideally I want to work for a more exciting and notable company such as Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, or something along those lines (relocating isn't a problem). I would really appreciate if somebody could tell me what my chances would be at a company of those calibers, or tell me what a more appropriate plan of action would be to maximize my chances next year.

I cross-compile my code from my laptop to a Beaglebone Black, to which the touchscreen is connected. 

The Beaglebone is running Debian 7.5 and I'm using Qt 4.8.6 to compile my code. 

I've used the following tutorial to get the cross-compiling to work: 

http://embedded.von-kannen.net/2014/05/21/qt-4-8-6-on-beaglebone-black/

During the tutorial at some point you delete linux' desktop manager application (lightdm), because it's incompatible with Qt's QWS window manager. This is fine, however it appears Qt's window manager has mouse acceleration turned on. When I put my finger on the screen the cursor does not appear underneath my finger, but somewhere a bit off and travels at a different speed. 

I can't seem to figure out how to turn off the mouse acceleration, and it seems there isn't a lot of information on the subject.

tl;dr:
Touch screen + Qt's QWS window manager = mouse acceleration.
Want to kill mouse acceleration.

Need help, please.

PS. disabling cursor visibility doesn't help (though that was probably to be expexcted :/)


**edit:**

I'm starting to doubt whether mouse acceleration is actually my real problem at all.
I feel like part of my tslib for the touchscreen hasn't actually installed properly. When I try to run /usr/bin/ts_config or /usr/bin/ts_test I am told they can't find ts_config and ts_open :/

I followed the tutorial though, so what went wrong D: ?

**editedit:**
nope, definitely mouse accel. It goes further the faster I move :/
Since I've killed lightdm, it can only come from QWS I think. There's some library called &lt;QWSCalibratedMouseHandler&gt; but frankly I just have no idea what to do with it and whether it is what I need at all :(. Qt's documentation is always illegible to the untrained T_T

notable:
I found a function that was supposed to tell me if mouse accelaration turned on or not. 

    QScreenCursor* qscursor = new QScreenCursor;
    qscursor-&gt;hide();
    bool aap = qscursor-&gt;isAccelerated();
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; ""acceleration of cursor is "" &lt;&lt; aap;

Assuming I've done it correctly the qDebug value I get is: ""acceleration of cursor is false"""

The position is engineering related and I have worked in the company this summer for an internship. I just graduated with a B.Eng. and am fully capable of doing the job.

In fact, I even know somone in the team that I applied for and contacted her via Linkedin to talk about the position. She gave me a lot of tips and inside information about the position. 

I prepared all weekend, watching videos, writing down my key skills and examples. Preparing for this HR phone interview. I built up so much pressure (as I am unemployed and finally got an interview in my DREAM company). Preparing so much I felt like I was ready but when the call came ...it was a disaster.

I was so nervous my voice was shaking. I couldn't think straight and my voice was not confident. I had trouble in the past with talking to much during an interview and thus I tried to keep my answers short. She asked simple questions like 
what was your role in your internship?
Are you working right now?
When would you be able to be hired?
Tell me about a situation where you got feedback and criticism.
Tell me about a time where you made a change to improve a process.

Those questions seemed simple and answered good.
I messedup when she asked tell me 2 of your best skills that would benifit for this position.

I had all my skills written down with examples of stories and how it would help. Thinking on the spot I picked the best skill but didnt pick the 2nd best skill. 

I also just listed them as I assumed she would ask me to talk more about the skills. I did not give examples and didnt pitch myself. I am so disappointed that all this planning was gone for waste. 

She also asked for my reporting cheifs name (maybe she will get in contact with him).

I know that If I got to the interview stage I am confident I could win them over.

The call lasted 13 min (she didnt want to waste anymore time with me?)

I feel like giving up...all that preparation gone in the trash. She said she would let me know by the end of the week or next week.

I obtained this degree because it gave me the chance to explore different things that I like (languages, history, cultures, traveling, etc) but in some of my classes I've never felt that it was for me, for example those dealing strongly with theories or politics. 

Apart from that, I've always liked movies, and I am currently doing an internship in a production company. I've found that I don't like this internship as much as I thought and I've found that as much as I like movies maybe the process of making them is not as interesting to me (since I don't see myself as a very creative person). I don't know if I should stick with it for a little more because I've been waiting for this opportunity for SO LONG and the chance to work in production and maybe I will find something that I like or just pursue something that has to do with my major. 

Is it normal to like the idea of something more than the practice itself? I just want to know if other people have gone through similar experiences..."

I am a junior computer science student in Texas (UT) and have two options laid before me. Note I speak some French but no German at all and I have never been to Europe (I interned abroad in Hong Kong already).



**OPTION A:**

* Spring: Intern in Tettnang Germany doing a machine translation project (what I am super interested in) but only make 1000 euro/month (my parents would cover my housing). I would be working approximately full time but have 3 vacation days a month plus weekends and holidays. I would likely not live in tettnang but somewhere close.

* Summer: Intern at a well know software company in San Francisco

* Fall&amp;Spring: Spend my senior year in Austin taking classes like normal.


**OPTION B:**

* Spring: Stay here and take classes

* Summer: Same (Internship in San Fran)

* Fall: Study abroad and take classes in France

* Spring: Spend my last semester in Austin



I feel SO conflicted. I have already had numerous internships and don't need any more experience and the money is crap so neither of those are motivators. I am just nervous that I will be wasting away my semester abroad by working full time instead of going with a group of youngnpeople and taking classes (with less stress). I feel like I have my whole life to work but this is such a great opportunity idk if I can pass it up. But at the same time I will go a whole semester without classes.
I really would love any input at all. I feel like throwing up. I also have a long term boyfriend but he has encouraged me to not consider the relationship in this decision which I agree with."

I'm a computer science senior who's been searching for new grad jobs starting in summer of 2015. However, it's entirely possible that I may not graduate on time, due to lacking in a few remaining general credits (not necessarily for CS).

So if I end up committing to a full-time offer and I cannot graduate when I said I would, what would happen? Would it be beneficial to apply to internship positions instead and list a more ambiguous graduation date?"
2mkp33,5,2014-11-17,Do I have no chance or hope to do something big?,coolio777,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mkp33/do_i_have_no_chance_or_hope_to_do_something_big/,"This is my first time posting here, so I apologize if I am doing something wrong. Let me know and I'll fix it.
---------------------------------------------

Do I have no chance or hope to do something big? Whether it's an internship or a job? Even a pay-less internship at some big company.

I applied to Microsoft, Google, Facebook, DropBox, Box, Quora as well as some others. Representatives from Box and Quora were kind enough to let me know that while my background was good/impressive, they had no open positions for me.

Other companies didn't bother replying. I understand, since they're big companies and have a lot of stuff to do than just to look at me.

Maybe this is the time when reality hits you and makes you feel awful. I though my knowledge of programming and technology would drastically increase my chances of getting a good internship. Although, I was pretty naïve to think that, since there are millions of other people who are probably better than me.

I understand I am not even in a bachelor's program, but the major that I am currently enrolled in is ""Computer Science Transfer"", designed that once you finish two years in this school, you automatically transfer to a 4-year institute for Bachelor's program (obviously a college of your choice, but with certain GPA requirements). So it's not like I am looking for a job with an Associate's degree. I do have plans for Bachelor's and probably Master's.

Do I have no hope to get an internship from one of these top tech companies?

I have also attached my resume (with personal information removed) that I have been sending to everyone. You can find it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4lcbpbfxqo7b7s8/Resume.docx?dl=0).

If you choose to, please rip apart this Resume and whatever approach I have right now. In fact, I encourage you to. But, I would also appreciate if you tell me where I am going wrong and what I could do better.

Any help is appreciated. Thank You!

I'm still in school but am currently working a paid internship as a Software Developer for a small start-up. Where I work, everyone is white American or European and I'm pretty sure I'm the only Hispanic in the *entire* company. So this got me wondering what the rest of the CE/CS world is like.

What have been your experiences with diversity at your workplace(s)?

Also, for the most part I'm treated well. Sometimes I feel like there is some contempt towards me from the Senior Software Developers, but maybe that's just something that comes with the title of ""Intern"" and my limited knowledge in the field."

       I am currently living in Metro Detroit and doing contract work as a Ruby on Rails developer. I moved here when I got married and have still  have to finish school (there is a calculus pre-req to the rest of my computer science classes, I am working on getting that requirement done). I am about halfway through a remote, contract RoR position. 
Before that I was working as an RoR dev for a local company for a year. 
Before that I taught AP computer science at a HS. 


I am looking for advice on what to do when the contract ends. Locally there is a very little demand for Ruby on Rails. Most of the 'tone' is set by the auto industry. My current plan is to try to find another remote position or contract. 
However I would much prefer to work in an office. 
Furthermore, on issue I have is that I am not yet done with school. I am trying my best to change that, but it will take time, and I can not afford to go to class full-time. 
This is an issue because when many see my resume, the education section hurts me. They either ignore the rest of my experience and might offer me a sub par internship (at best) or assume I have graduated (despite it saying otherwise) and be disappointed when that is not the case. 

My marketable skillset is mainly RoR, I know Java, have done a wee bit of ruby-motion development, and have some experience in PHP. 
I am looking for advice on anything I can do to improve my situation outside of what I am already doing.   "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Thank you so much for doing this AMA. The Supreme Court only releases audio recordings of Oral Arguments, do you feel that this is the best way for the Supreme Court to share the cases with the American people? Do you think having video recordings would change anything related to public perception of cases or would that be irrelevant? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53c7p?context=5)|I have noticed from questions submitted earlier that there is a misunderstanding about the way audio is released.  It posted online on Friday afternoon of every argument week, not on the same day as arguments take place.  There are rare exceptions,  i.e., the same sex marriage arguments, Obamacare, where the audio is released when the argument is over.  But on a normal day, we do not get audio, though we now do get an unofficial transcript in the afternoon, so I am able to check my notes against that.  Until quite recently, there was no way to check, so we reporters used to gather in the press room afterwards to see who got what precisely, and then we just agreed, that was the quote. 
[How has the SCOTUS changed over the past 20 years and how is it the same? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53srn?context=5)|The biggest change is that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Reagan conservative with a centrist bent, has been replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, who is a movement conservative. That means that the court has moved in a dramatically more conservative direction--witness Alito's decision last term in the Hobby Lobby case, ruling for the first time ever that some for-profit corporations may be exempt, on religious grounds, from a generally applicable federal law.  
[Hi Nina, thanks for doing this!  Is it difficult to balance having a good relationship with your sources and staying objective? I'm in journalism, too--I would imagine that if you talk to a certain person all the time, you get friendly with them, but you still have to be hard on them. Is that something you find easy now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53f1g?context=5)|There is a difference between personal friendship and covering an institution.  It sort of is what it is.  You can't trim your professional  sails just because you know and like a justice, for example. You have to report as objectively and interestingly as possible. Sometimes that means you end up writing unflattering things, and sometimes, flattering ones. The one exception to this rule, I must note, is that when I met my late husband, he was a U.S. senator, and I got nowhere near anything he did. 
[I want to say thank you. Your work is fantastic and incredibly appreciated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53htw?context=5)|Around the time of the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, I did a three part series for ATC on how the case was decided, based on the notes of the justices, which by then were available, and interviews with all the living law clerks who had worked on the decision.  I really like the way it turned out and think it is very revealing on the times and how the decision evolved.
[I was wondering if there is any certain piece you've written over the years that has been your favorite or, if not, what SCOTUS decision was the most interesting for you to cover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53htw?context=5)|([Link to www.npr.org](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1537409))
[What do you think about the SCOTUS practice of not highlighting changes made to opinions between slip and final publication? Don't we deserve an explicit heads-up when something has been modified? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53qd4?context=5)|You got the first such heads up from Justice Ginsburg a short while ago. I suspect others will do likewise, but the truth is that these really are small changes in opinions. You really aren't missing all that much if you don't know; besides which, if the justices don't fess up, the academic bloggers will tell you about it; indeed, that is often how the justices find out they goofed. 
[What was it like doing Inside Washington for 21 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm5340j?context=5)|It was enormous fun.  The guys became very good friends, including Charles Krauthammer.  When my late husband was very ill, they all pitched in enormously to keep my spirits up, and when I started dating David, Gorden Peterson and his wife Ann gave a party, the purpose of which was to get a look at the new guy!!!
[1\) How has gender affected your career, especially as you got older?  2\) Do you have any advice for individuals entering professional fields where they are underrepresented?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm548ve?context=5)|It was a lot harder when I started out and there were no other women everywhere I worked.  NPR was the first place where there were lots of women, and it was largely because NPR paid so little back then. Women were the only people willing to work for that money, and management got, forgive the expression, more bang for its bucks. 
[Nina,  As a paralegal, you're my favorite NPR personality by far.  What do you think of the recent issue of judicial elections being swayed with outside campaign donations? Do you think it will result in rulings being influenced? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53i75?context=5)|Although I know that appointing judges can have its problems, I think electing them really is a system waiting for scandal. Judges, after all, are human beings, and if they are always worrying about how a decision will look in a 30 second ad, that is a very big problem for justice.
[You've been with NPR long enough to have been a part of the huge move to the internet. Do you think that it has made your job as a journalist better or just more complicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm542an?context=5)|More complicated.  Yes, I can check facts more quickly, but I now have to file on multiple platforms. It seems the day is never over now, in terms of how often and for how many venues we file. The consequence is that it is harder to really focus and think about a story. 
[Has not being a lawyer been an advantage or disadvantage as a legal affairs reporter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53hyk?context=5)|In the long run, it probably is an advantage, since I am writing and reporting for people who, for the most part, are not lawyers.  The trick is to write for them, but in a way that tells lawyers something important too. 
[Nina, what is the funniest or oddest thing you've ever witnessed during a Supreme Court session?  Thank you for making all that legal mumbo jumbo fun! Gina Claborn.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53aww?context=5)|I am not good at ever.  But the funniest day recently was the day the clocks were literally spinning in the courtroom (it was the time change day) and Justice Breyer, upon ascending the bench, almost say in Justice Sotomayor's chair.  She caught him in time. 
[What's a quirky fact that people are surprised to find out about the Supreme Court (could be about specific justices or the court as a whole\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53rvt?context=5)|Justice Kennedy gets to the Court very very early in the morning, and if court is not sitting, he is getting ready to leave when Justice Ginsburg arrives.  She often works until 3 or 4 in the morning, then comes into the court in the afternoon. 
[Are you and your team planning on doing anything with John Oliver's doggy Supreme Court footage? I'd honestly rather have your voice over those dogs than the actual audio.  I loved your work on 2776. Have you had much vocal training? Is it a hobby of yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm531px?context=5)|Uh, I have no team. It's just me, and an intern.  And aside from laughing my head off, I am not doing anything on John Oliver.   No vocal training.  I am blessed with a big, somewhat operatic voice, but that is God's hand, not mine.  My father, see above, always told me that his father had a beautiful singing voice.  
[Should cert granted on the King (ACA\) case scare proponents of the law? A purely textualist reading of the statute leads me to believe the government wins, but the cert grant has me wondering if textualism can be reduced to one sentence in 900 pages of statute. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53dv3?context=5)|As in every case like this, there are decent arguments on both sides, but here the Court reached out to grant this case in a manner that is contrary to its usual practice, and with no conflict in the lower courts.   So, supporters of the law are justifiably worried. 
[Hi Nina! So excited you're doing this AMA.  My question: what do you look like? And how does that compare with how people imagine you to look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53gqs?context=5)|Well, because I have done so much television, people usually have some idea of what I look like.  Go to my bio at npr, or twitter account, and you will see a photo. 
[Silly question i know, but has there ever been a politician, or some other high status individual that actually knew who you were before you even formally met? how great and/or accomplished did it make you feel? thanks for doing this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm532ih?context=5)|We have lots of listeners, including pols.  Early in then Sen. Obama's Senate tenure, I got an elevator with him, and he was incredibly nice about my legal coverage.  It was the one and only time I met him!
[Do you and the justices ever go to the same parties? How common is it to see them in social setting these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53fbh?context=5)|Fairly common.  I see several of them at the opera, or the ballet, etc. and at big legal events, at the Library of Congress, for instance. 
[Hi Ms. Totenberg. Just wanted to ask, do you listen to NPR in your free time? If not, where do you choose to get your news?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm54bx7?context=5)|I DO listen to NPR. Even have a radio in the shower! I also read the New York Times, the Washington Post, and sometimes the Wall Street Journal. 
[Do you like the show The Newsroom?  On a scale of 1 to Sarin, how scandalous is your work, really?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm54kgm?context=5)|I liked it, though it had a definite political perspective. It did capture some of the difficulties of modern journalism.
[How aware do you believe the Chief Justice is to the legacy of his Court? Justices, of course, usually say they just decide on the merits. However, he did mention the other day of being bothered by the ""partisan Court"" rumors. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53u7c?context=5)|All the justices hate the notion that they might have partisan motives, and as I said, I don't think they do.  They do have strong views on how to interpret the law and the constitution. 
[In my opinion Scalia and Thomas will be reviled by historians. Do you agree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm557oi?context=5)|No.  Just because their views are different than yours does not mean they will be  ""reviled"" in history. 
[Nina, have you ever heard Thomas speaking, ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2mklva/i_am_nina_totenberg_npr_legal_affairs/cm53lwb?context=5)|He used to ask the occasional question, though no longer.  And he does give speeches.

2ml5up,4,2014-11-17,Strong chance I will not finish my degree. Need advice on my next move.,Csthrowaway2308,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ml5up/strong_chance_i_will_not_finish_my_degree_need/,"Hey guys. Due to financial and personal reasons out of my control, I will likely not be able to finish my degree. I'm currently a 3rd year in Computer Science.

I've looked at questions on this subreddit pertaining to getting a job without a degree, and the general consensus seems to be that, while getting a job without a degree is possible, it requires a strong portfolio and/or job experience. I have no job or interning experience (I was unable to land any paid internships; an unpaid one was always out of the question because I work full time as a delivery driver in order to pay bills and school, so I would not be able to juggle an unpaid internship.) and my github only contains simple, well known algorithms and a fitness web app made using the MEAN Stack.

Ideally, I want to have a strong portfolio by the end of summer 2015, which is likely my last semester until I can no longer continue my degree. I'd really appreciate any advice on what projects I can feasibly get done assuming I have an average of 1-3 hours a day to work on them. I'd also like some advice on whether my plan of action is sound and to know if the fact that I've got an unfinished degree would look bad on a resume or if employers will see it as a strength.

I sincerely appreciate any advice and thank you all for your time.

2mlb64,51,2014-11-17,Graduated with a CS degree but don't like CS anymore. What are my options?,ZeBigBoss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mlb64/graduated_with_a_cs_degree_but_dont_like_cs/,"I have completed a bachelor's degree in computer science at a respectable university and I am currently in the first semester of an M.Eng. degree with a focus in computer security. The problem is that I simply don't like computer science anymore.



I did two consulting internships in which I programmed in JavaScript for an ERP system, but didn't like the job because it was too easy and thus boring. I am not the kind of person who will spend their free time staying up to date with the latest tools/technologies or self-teach myself a new programming language or tool. Recently, I was told by a company at a tech fair that they only consider prospects who are participating in multiple open-source projects on GitHub on their personal time. I am not that person either. Most job offers require something that wasn't taught during my bachelor's degree (.NET is a big one, but it's mostly tools and stuff like networking protocols). I feel very jaded with the industry/field as a whole. I enrolled in a Master's degree because I liked the security class I took and wanted to specialize in that, but I found out it's probably the biggest offender in the ""staying up to date on your own free time"" category.



What can someone with a CS degree do that isn't CS?



PS: When I write CS, I mean CS/programming/QA/IT (i.e. sitting at a computer and looking at code for a living). I'm not too keen about business analyst or project management either.



PPS: Sorry if this has been asked before, but I searched the subreddit for similar posts and haven't found any.



**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for the replies and the good advice. It might be the mood I am in or the classes I'm currently taking (no security classes were offered this semester), which would confirm /u/Cheech47's case of the fuck-it's theory.

I think /u/buckus69 put it nicely too when he said
&gt; At the end of the day, development is a job, it doesn't have to be a lifestyle.

I might be under the false impression that you need to have the CS lifestyle to have an interesting CS job. I like to learn new things, just not CS-related things.

2mm0en,4,2014-11-17,"Less than traditional undergrad, looking to transition into academia.",nahuse,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2mm0en/less_than_traditional_undergrad_looking_to/,"Hello, AskAcademia, I am another undergrad struggling with direction.

I am currently 26 years old, and knew that I would be unable to pay for college out of high school. So, I got a job right out of school that I would classify as a professional trade in the healthcare industry; I have been doing it for just about six years now. In the process of getting this job, I was required to take some basic, science related classes, and some Spanish. About two years ago I made the decision to return to school for my BA, with the idea that I would try to transition into graduate school and ultimately teaching. History. I have done my research, and am a frequent lurker here, so I understand the dismal job outlook. I believe that my passion for history and for teaching, and strong work ethic, gives me a fair shot at graduate school, but I also understand that I need to get into the correct school, which are incredibly competitive. My questions are what my best options are for moving forward.

I am currently attending a (as far as I know) middle-of-the road state school in the west, with an overall GPA of 3.8 and a History GPA of 4.0. I am still working full time, and attending school part time (about 9 to 12 credit hours/semester), and am currently volunteering and trying for internships at a local museum. At this rate, I should be graduated in about three to four more years. I have fostered some very positive relationships with several professors, who tell me that I have the right mindset and work ethic to be successful. 

The problem I am facing is that there is only one graduate program for History in my state, and it has nothing to do with my interests (which are either Medieval European or pre-industrial European History, broadly), and very few professors in my state place emphasis on my interests. My question is: do I have a chance of acceptance into competitive graduate schools if I keep on my current track? Do you have any advice for a less than traditional, older student trying to get into academia?

Thank you so much for your time, and for any advice. I welcome any questions.

tl;dr: I'm a bit older, and geography is working against me, but I would love to teach and research History. Do I have a shot at graduate school?"

It ends in a month. However, I have come to absolutely hate it. 

I've fallen behind in my work (partly due to depression, I'm sure (SAD); partly due to poor estimates on the part of my manager; and partly due to running into unexpected issues that extended the time frame). In any case, I've been told to work late and weekends, which isn't something I can really do (I often need my coworkers' help, and after 8 hours my brain is pretty fried and ineffective).

The lack of support and sunlight (Seasonal affective disorder) in this part of the country (I moved away from friends, family, and my SO for this) is making life hard without extra work pressure. I just want to go home to my support network. I have some friends here, but we are not so close.

I don't give two shits about this company. I've done other internships during school and excelled, at companies where the culture was much more suited to my work style and needs as an employee.

The point of this internship was basically to get a return offer, which I doubt I'll get at this point. My manager basically asked me ""do you even want an offer?"" so, yeah... But I'm just at such a low that I don't even want it. I wouldn't want to come back to this company culture anyway, but there is another office closer to my home that I might want to work at (culture varies from team to team, like at any company).

Unfortunately this has also made me question my career path a bit - seeing as this kind of work and culture are pretty common in the industry, I don't know if it is what I want to commit to. I even thought the other day, ""Maybe I should become an electrician and do home automation instead, that could be really cool."" Project management is something I'm good at (previous internship experience), so that's a less drastic change. 

My concern comes mainly from references. I have plenty of good references, but most prospective employers will want to call my most recent manager, right? I'm worried about it if I stay, but I feel like quiting now would look even worse. 

Also, money. Its only one more month and that means 1) I won't have to pay back relocation funds ($1500 for the last month) and 2) will get paid for the last month ($4000 after tax). Being und student loan debt, I need the money. 

Sorry for the vent, but I'd like some perspectives. Thanks!

**tl;dr:** I hate my internship but only have one month left, I'm worried about the references I'll get. "

I haven't done any internships (I did some research into machine learning, but don't have much to show for it right now.) but I have written an iOS app a few years back that is pretty clean and have a pretty vast library of in-progress projects that may or may not be helpful (I make music in haskell with markov chains and dick around with procedural graphics generation using fractals and raymarching (openGL / metal / whatev) and have a pretty strong familiarity with C family languages) and have taken 7-8 courses via MOOCs or self-study that mostly span data-science type stuff. I also did some fairly intensive multithreadiing in my networking course (honors) and those projects are completed and work nicely.

I can't go back at the moment (I'm sure I will in a year or two), but I do need a source of income. Unfortunately I have very little in the way of corporate networking and while I can boast plenty of CS / Programming skill; I don't know how to turn that into money. My fear is that my personal interests aren't really marketable without a masters/phd or a really strong reputation of some sort. Should I suck it up and try to do some iOS-dev or something high-demand for a while? Would a company consider me (preferably for a position I can learn from) despite a lack of paper credentials?"

*what is the right direction to take to get into the video game industry?

*Computer science vs. Computer Engineering vs. ?

*What are courses I def need to take?

*Go for Master's?

*Internships?

I have a Bachelor's of Science in BME with minors in Chem and Bio.

Some details:
I'm 18, I have pretty good grades in terms of computing and work experience. I've worked for 1 year currently setting up computers, networks and generally being the ""IT Guy"". This was a whole Intern thing basically and during it I went on Microsoft setting up Windows 8 and Cisco ICND1(? I think that was the name?) courses but never did the exam at the end of it.

I love computers, I love how they work I love troubleshooting and I love learning and reading tech news everyday, Basically at the moment i'm in my dream job. but I want to do more and focus on what I am good at and learn more and be better at what I do.

But I keep seeing people saying ""Pick something you are good at and focus on it""

I don't know what to focus on. I know it's very early days for me to be setting my self my actual career until i'm 65 at the age of 18 but it wouldn't hurt to plan.

Networks do interest me but I don't know how to actually set them up. I mean I can configure your basic routers and switches but anything involving a CLI I would have to follow a guide or read up on it first. I've began ordering networking equipment and my own rack just to familiarize myself with setting everything up maybe getting a home server going for learning purposes.


So I don't know, does anyone know what path I should pursue? Maybe I should just wait a couple of years and decide then? Too early? 

I'm not a big fan of scripting and programming but I have taken steps to learn php and code some sites for my work. Basic things like status checkers.

If I missed anything of importance out let me know and i'll add it in.


If this is the wrong place for this heh let me know. Just want some professional advice from people who have been in this stage as well.

However sometimes they pretty much prevent it from happening.

I have a particular example in mind. 1 year ago, while i was doing my internship at the end of my degree, my tutor was really hard to join (Small IT company, often on the move to visit clients) so i was frequently emailing him for questions i had or interventions/decisions i had to take. Sometimes when it was benign he'd email me back, but most of the time and EVERY TIME when it was something important, he'd call me or wait to see me in the office to answer me.

So i only realized it afterwards, but he did nothing in writing that could compromise him, so i could have been in trouble for things i wasn't responsible for. And since he was kind of an asshole i'm starting to think that i dodged a bullet (when i began my internship he talked about engaging me after, and before the end he told me this was going to be done, turns out theses were empty promises , and like the rest they were verbal, nothing in writing...)

now this was last year and I've been over it since, but i'm worried i could in the future be confronted with a guy having a similar attitude. How could i deal with it and force him to get something in writing when he can call me or visit my office if he wants to avoid compromise himself ?

This is my last year on college (EE program) and I've been working my first job as an intern at this company for an year, more or less. It looked like a good oportunity at first: better than average pay, close to the campus, flexible hours, and I was quite motivated to be working there, for the first three months at least. There are some things about the company that I'm not happy about, and I would like a neutral opinion about this matters, since it's my first job, and the advices I'm getting seem to be a little biased...

It's a relatively small company, that grew a lot in the last 3 years, from 20 employees to about a 100 or more. In my opinion (Shared by most of my colleagues) the management does not make a good job, well... managing. There are serious internal communication issues, as of completely disregarding the input of a department until halfway of a project, and the management doesn't think of it as an issue. The projects scopes are not clear and keep changing at the whims of the directors, with no regard to the work we put up. Some key employees are unmotivated and quitting their position, claiming they see no room for growing inside the company. Most of my colleages are inexperienced, straight out of college and are being paid way bellow the average, about twice of what I'm paid as an intern. The most senior engineer there (Except for the founders) doesn't get paid the average salary and he has 20years of experience.

As for my job there, I wasn't given much training when I started, but I took it as normal and tried to do my best. Tried to help with what I could, but with no experience and clear procedures, there wasn't much I could do, so I've been idle for a lot of time and made lots of mistakes. Halfway of the year, some employees quit and they dumped some extra tasks on me. I've taken more responsabilities than a intern should, in my opinion and also in the opinion of my colleagues, and made more mistakes. The work load didn't actually put me down, what really did was the mess in the directives and the lack of assistance from those working with me.

That been said, I'll probably wont stay in the company after graduating, but I'd like some opinions if it's something that I should expect in other companies or what should I do to face this kinds of situations.

When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ""attention problems"" but my parents refused to give me any medicine because they thought it was gonna go away eventually. Oh boy they were wrong.


Throughout all highschool I struggled so much to focus in class, 10 minutes was my limit, after that I would begin fidgeting, reading other chapters of my textbook, looking outside and being distacted by crows and so on.
I ended up repeating my last year before university 3 times due to me not being able to focus at all. I somehow made it.


Now I'm nearing my second year of university, currently in an internship, and it is hell on earth atm. I just can't focus, it's a thousand times worse than some years ago.

Once I had decided that I had enough of feeling like this, I start browsing stuff online and fidgeting like crazy. I can't keep my fingers in place (constant finger drumming on my leg).


I'm worried about my future, I already struggle learning anything during / outside of class, everything is either painful or just plain distracting.


I'm scared of getting treatment though, I don't know what to expect, people in France actually look down on people who have this, in general you see documentaries shitting on medication saying that ""hyperactive kids just have a ton of energy, this shit is a scam!"".

**OPTION A:**


* Spring: Intern in Tettnang Germany at Avira doing a machine translation project (what I am super interested in) but only make 1000 euro/month (my parents would cover my housing). I would be working approximately full time but have 3 vacation days a month plus weekends and holidays. I would likely not live in tettnang but somewhere close.

* Fall&amp;Spring: Spend my senior year in Austin taking classes like normal.

* Spring: Stay here and take classes


* Summer: Same (Internship in San Fran)


* Fall: Study abroad and take classes in France


* Spring: Spend my last semester in Austin



I feel SO conflicted. I have already had numerous internships and don't need any more experience and the money is crap so neither of those are motivators.

I have previously interned at the same company for 6 months (salary was about 60k an intern) and have about 2 years of intern experience under my belt at this point from major cs companies. Although maybe I am confused about the starting rate in the Boston area, but I did expect around 80k+.

2. How should I go about negotiating? I read the very informative salary post posted earlier today and have some ideas. However, I never have negotiated before. As an intern I was just like great, let's go!

I don't want a bullshit answer. I want honesty and something I need to hear!

Here's the situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. He is 20, and I am 19. We have a very good, fun best-friends-in-love type of relationship, a relationship most people would kill for. We are so in sync, open with each other, and just, in short, each other's puzzle piece. 

However, there are a few problems in my relationship that has been going on for years and years and never seem to get fixed. I believe it began after celebrating our first anniversary. I would often get these urges, not sexual or flirty, just kind of reckless... I would always talk to other guys as if I were single. It would go on for a few weeks and then I'd either fess up or purposefully mess up this little fling just to stop my awful behavior. There were times that he caught me, and he still stayed, and I am grateful for that. 

In January, when I got back from vacation (I was gone for two weeks...), I discovered he was sexting another girl. I was livid. Sure I talked to other guys sometimes, but I NEVER sent pictures or even so much let the conversation go that far... We ended up fighting for it for weeks and finally just let the situation go. After that, things were great. 

I did not talk to another guy for about six months after that. But as I became fully committed to him, I began to realize that he was beginning to be inconsistent, not keeping his word and basically throwing in the towel on the romance department. The notes, flowers, sweet good morning texts, and just the little things mainly, all halted to an abrupt stop. I'd get lonely, get the urges, and we'd fight over it like we always do. This has happened perhaps...ten times in the relationship. I notice he's not being consistent, so I call him out on it, then he promises to change and it's just a never ending circle.

He'll promise that he'll stop being so poor in his pursuit for me. I try to put it in perspective, but he doesn't get it. He thinks he does enough for me. I love him very much, but he does not keep his word....ever! He is always failing assignments and putting a lot of dumb priorities before his college classes. I am constantly having to remind him to do a test or an assignment or study. I hate being his mother... When I back off for a while, his grades start to drop, and he begins to lack in the romance department once again.

For a while, I was head over heels with him. We had a huge fight a month or two ago. He finally admitted he never truly got over the flirting I used to do. I argued that it was immature to not let go, as it happened almost three years ago. I always knew he was insecure, but after all this time, I finally realized he did not trust me, even though I was under the impression that I got his forgiveness. I hugged him and told him I understood after he said he was always scared of what was going to happen next in our relationship. I tried to put it in my perspective, but I was angry about his inability to truly forgive me after all this time. He swore he'd stop being so lazy and get his grades up (He had 3 F's on his midterms...), put school first, start treating me special again, and not make me feel so alone.

Things have been fine, honestly. He is always giving me compliments and telling me how great I am...and yet, I feel alone once again. I tried to take the initiative and give him a just-because gift and a sweet homemade invitation to go on a date instead of nagging him to bring that spark back, but it never seems to work. He told me to change my ""nagging"", my tendency to blow up rather than think things through, my stupid games when I argue, and my past infidelity. I have done all of that. Why can't he do it for me?

We talk about marriage and having children, but the more and more time we spend together, the less and less I see that happening. When he is around, we are inseparable. I love him very much, but the way he constantly fails to keep his word makes me very nervous and anxious. I feel alone a lot of the time. 

I am unemployed, and he is always nagging me to get a job. I live with my parents and go to school full-time and have a lot of internship offers. There's stipend pay and some are unpaid, but I always see them as fantastic opportunities. I took on the editorial position at a publishing company and have an internship lined up with the TV station WSRE. He's always complaining that internships aren't real jobs and I need a job and all this nonsense. Sometimes I wish he believed in me. It's not like I'm sitting here lazing around. I apply everywhere I can and call the employers as time goes on to show my interest. I've always supported him. He lost his job and his car in a flood all in one month. I always stood by his side and believed in him. I even helped him pay for his school fees even when I had a little under 200 dollars left in my bank account from my savings. He is very lazy and untidy. At a certain extent I can handle it, but his bedroom looks like a 14 year old boy lives in it. He never cleans it. There's dirt always in his bed and he never does his laundry...like ever. Sometimes he doesn't even wear underwear for days because he's too lazy to do his laundry. He always tells me he'll keep his hygiene, too. I am not picky, but honestly, would it hurt to tweeze your eyebrows or brush your teeth more often? He wears shorts and jeans with nasty stains and hole-covered shirts and has promised he'll buy himself some nice clothes with his paychecks. However, this never happens.


I want to be with him, but his failure to keep his promises has me uneasy. I find myself antsy and wanting the attention of other guys. I tried to talk to him, but he usually tells me ""I'm here babe, you don't have to feel alone."" I feel so guilty. He really truly does a lot for me. He is taking math class with me next semester because he knows I have trouble with math. He comes over a lot even when he lives all the way across town. He is my first long term boyfriend and someone I can picture myself with forever most of the time. Sometimes I have this urge to say goodbye and never look back...because his broken promises and failure to change his ways continue to break my heart. If he can't keep his word, how can I trust him to make me happy? 

This whole situation happens on and off. I stay because I believe things will get better. I've already had ""breaks"" with him where we don't talk. We even broke up and dated other people for a month or two last year. I thought if we had an experience of what it was like to be single, he'd realize what he needed to do to make things right. While I was dating, I realized I had a lot of things I needed to assess. I did. I stopped being so emotionally abusive and so easily-angered. I thought I really did a good job. Why is he failing to put his 100% in this relationship? I thought if I left, he'd finally realize what he needed to do. 

The bad part is, I feel guilty about expecting all of this. We're best friends. We laugh about the same things, like the same movies, music, and video-games, and have the same goals in life. I don't know why he thinks it's so hard to do all these wonderful things. I understand that the honeymoon phase fades, but is it too much to ask to be romanced once and a while? I do my part. I'm always writing him notes and giving him just-because gifts I make myself. I'm always reminding him how much he means to me. I only get sweet things from him when I'm feeling upset or I'm mad at him. He stops his behavior consistently and I do not know what to do to truly make him see that this constant on-and-off isn't right.

What would you do? I'm feeling lonely and crying about it. I'm wanting to leave and just never come back...but part of me is afraid I'm throwing something wonderful away. I'm also afraid I won't find a love like his again. Even if he is constantly on and off with me and plays these dumb games, I know when I'm in his arms, he truly loves me. Why is it so hard to change, then?

I'm really needing some advice. Much appreciated. BE BRUTALLY HONEST. "

Program in the US for Computer Science for admission in Fall 2015. I'm particularly looking at programs with a strong focus in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science or Computational Neuroscience. However, I've been reading some of the threads on here and it makes me feel that my chances are terrible. Here is my situation:

* GPA: 3.5/4
* GRE: 334/340
* TOEFL: 115/120
* Work Experience: 3-month internships at a fairly large software development company and a small firm unrelated to the field.
* Research Experience: Projects in college related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning, a year with an independent UAV development team, currently working on some mobile applications using mining techniques etc. Pending university approval, I will spend my final semester working on my senior undergraduate thesis at a research lab in a major university in the US, which deals in Cognitive Science, Data Analysis, etc. and would certainly count as relevant research experience.
* Extracurriculars: A bit hazy but I've been a member of various student organizations like the university IEEE chapter, the college magazine editorial committee and so on.

What I'm enormously worried about, especially after reading this http://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/25gmig/a_somewhat_notgentle_guide_to_getting_into_grad/, is that some of my grades during my first 2 years at university are fairly terrible, e.g. B's in Calculus I and II, and most glaringly, a C in Linear Algebra. I have improved quite a bit in the last two years though, and I have straight A's in several core CS subjects I'm interested in, like Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Theory of Computation, Analysis of Algorithms etc.

Considering all this, what are my chances of getting in grad school in the US? Do I completely forget about trying for any university ranked in the top 30 schools?

Long story story short, I have an onsite interview coming up (for an internship), and I wasn't exactly sure what to wear from my limited options. I know the place has a fairly loose dress code, however, this is still an interview, so the rule of thumb is generally to dress a little better than normal. My problem is most of my wardrobe is fairly polarized when it comes to formal-ness. As a result, my more ""casual"" option would be jeans and a polo (which I fear might be underdressing a bit for an interview), with the next step up being full biz-casual with dress pants, dress shoes, tucked in button-down (which I think might be a little too formal).

I am contracted as the onsite IT guy at HostCo, a small bank branch of the large Financial Services branch of a HUGE German car company.

---

I've been battling this one for a few weeks now.

Our COO at HostCo contacted me via email about 4 weeks ago:

&gt; $User's mic is not working on his laptop. Did basic troubleshooting. Please advise.

I head over to $user's office to see what's up. It's an HP 8460p running Win7 Enterprise. Sure enough, the microphone isn't working at all, but the speakers work just fine. I plug in an external mic - no dice.

&gt;""Ok,"" I think, ""the input level could be muted somewhere?""

Open the Sound control panel and check the internal mic properties - full volume.

&gt;Driver issue?

Uninstall windows driver + reboot/reinstall driver from HP + reboot. Nothing.

As a last effort, I open the Sound control panel again and, while monitoring the input devices, plug in the external mic. It appears instantly, so I test it and - nothing. Levels check out, nothing is muted, but no input is being registered. I run this by one of my coworkers over IM, we conclude that it's going to be a warranty claim through HP.

HP gets the claim, and two days later, I get an email saying that it will be covered and that I should be getting a box the next day. Sweet. Three weeks pass by, so I call HP to see WTF is taking so long. Turns out that the box bound for my office was **crushed** by something at *their* warehouse. Awesome. An email would have been nice. 

I notify $user that his laptop will be covered and to expect to ship it out sometime next week. We set up a time convenient for him and start working out a loaner, since all of my crash pool devices are being used by some FDIC interns for a few weeks (gun-to-head finger motion).

Last Friday, I finally get a box from HP with return label and instructions on how to pack it properly, etc. Today, I'm finally able to secure a loaner, an HP 8460p identically-equipped to $user's. 

My plan was to simply swap out the hard drives, but I missed something crucial - Bitlocker. 

*facepalm* 

Thus began the long process of decrypting the hard drive (not difficult, just time-consuming). 

*I decided to do a bit of testing during the process, using my personal 8470p as the recipient of the loaner 8460p's previously-unencrypted HDD. Not surprisingly, it didn't play nice and was a massive headache overall.*

With $User's hard drive finally decrypted (250GB, nearly full) and removed, I nervously installed it into the loaner, closed the cover, and powered it up...

***Success!!***

I ran through a few processes to anticipate anything that might break, but so far it's working well. I shipped off the ""broken"" laptop and gave the fully-functioning loaner back to $user before lunch today, and so far no complaints.

Since working on their computers and server two months ago, they have recently considered firing their old IT guy due to his abrasive demeanor and have talked about contracting me. This is the part where my story becomes relevant: I would much rather work in IT than Psychology, but I'm going to be graduating with the wrong degree. 

Do you guys think a second bachelor's in IT would be my best choice, or should I get a master's and learn the bachelor's along the way? I'm assuming that their contract wouldn't be a large sum of money, and I'd end up working part time doing something like Geeksquad. I'd much rather have a formal education and work doing full time IT work when the student loans come-a-knocking.

Edit: By the way, I am only two semesters away from graduating with my degree, my school doesn't offer IT and their CS department isn't adequate, and I am in a long term relationship, so changing my degree now might be a folly."

At this career fair I met the Ruby manager from ""The Company"". The Company was a small/startup software company not far from the school, at this time they were willing to hire any CS senior (my major and my year). I talked for a bit to the recruiter and then gave my resume as usual. A few weeks later I get an e-mail from the manager asking for an on-site interview for an internship position and we agree to make an interview in a few weeks. A week later, I see a new message in my school e-mail that was sent 30 minutes ago. It was the Android manager of The Company asking about hiring people onto his team. I was excited because I was much more interested in programming on Android than doing Ruby. I e-mailed the Android manager and CC'd the Ruby manager telling them about my current interview planned and asking about joining the Android team. I

 waited two weeks but didn't get a reply. So then it came time for the on-site interview. I met with the Ruby manager and he talked for a couple for minutes. I then mentioned e-mail I sent to him (he claimed that he never saw it) I expressed my interest in joining the Android. So he stepped out and brought the Android manager came into the room. I talked to him about the e-mail I sent (in which he also claimed that he never saw) and be basically told me that he filled up all of the Android positions on his team (despite contacting him about joining his team 30 minutes after he asked every CS undergrad about joining his team).  He walked out and the Ruby manager came back in, I asked if it was possible to still joining the Ruby team (before I mentioned the e-mail he was ready to add me to his team) but now he told me I needed to get more experience with Ruby before I can join. 

My heart sank and I felt like was going to puke when I heard that. I had almost the last half year trying to get a job for when I graduated (even though the The Company was only offering internships, they transition into full time). And at that moment I found an employer that was willing to hire me right there, I just had to try to get the job that I wanted. Because of that, I lost the best opportunity at starting my career. The fault is not all mine though, if either manager decided to look at their e-mails and responded to me, this situation could have been avoid and would of kept my mouth shut. But that didn't happen. 
 
Fast forward to today, I just saw a photo of one my friends who works at The Company. He's smiling with a bunch of my old classmates and even with my crush. I've graduated, unemployed despite my attempts with several other companies, sleeping on my mother's couch (another long, bad story), and just seriously hating my life.

TLDR: An employer who was about to hire me for a position when I asked about another position that I was genuinely interested in but was unaware that that position was filled me. So I was rejected from both positions. Thus losing the best chance at starting my career. "

4. Health GenEd (ugh)
5. **CS: Discrete Structures**

Spring 2016:

1. Major Capstone
2. **Advanced statistics-based major class**
3. **Linear Algebra with Differential Equations**
4. **Applied Linear Regression**
5. **Either**: Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Organization, Software Engineering, or Web-based Information Systems (Can I have insight on this? I was thinking Alg and Data Structures is most important class.)


Even though I am confident that I CAN do this, I still feel nervous about whether I’m doing the right thing or if the classes I plan to take are going to lead to where I want to go. I've gotten feedback from a statistics professor and economics professor I respect about this, and they say it's a go. 

**Tl;DR: I really want to be a data analyst, am I on the right track? Is there anything I'm missing? I understand that you learn as you go, but I want to make myself a competitive standout in the job market (if possible).**

2mqkpk,0,2014-11-18,Wanting to keep the door open for grad school,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2mqkpk/wanting_to_keep_the_door_open_for_grad_school/,"I am a sophomore mechanical Engineering student.  
           
                         
I know that it is **far** too early to say that my passion is to go to graduate school and get a masters degree. There are so many other ways that life can turn out, I might have my heart set on becoming a Geologist a week from now. 
        
                        
But like the title says, I want to put in the work now so that the door is open later.            
            
**Questions**      
           
1.) I hear that research is essential to get accepted (or am I confusing PhD programs and/or non-engineering programs?) Research is very widely available for Biology and Chem majors, but I've never heard of any research opportunities for Mechanical Engineers. How do I substitute this?        
        
Would internships and extensive extracurricular activity substitute?  
       
2.) My GPA is only a 3.3 at the moment.          
-3.5 Math GPA-                 
-3.5 Science GPA-                     
                   
 This is largely because I was a mediocre high-school student. For instance, I am competing against kids who've already taken Calculus in high school for my Math GPA. So while its brand new to me, they're just reviewing. I am saying this because I expect my spot on the grade distribution bell curve to go up once i'm past Calculus and its a level playing field.                      
I see myself growing very much. Every semester, I gain a bit more of a drive for academics. Its getting to the point to where I am hungry to take more difficult classes and learn what I can from them.  
         
With that last bit in mind, I am confident that I can get at least a 3.5 by the time that I graduate.          
Also something to consider, I am in a transfer program. So while i'm sure that grad school will be examining the entire GPA, if I work hard enough, i'll be able to put *kick ass GPA &gt;3.5 from Ga Tech*, as my graduating GPA resets upon transfer.   
      
So could I get into grad school with a 3.5? Not just can I get in, but can I get into a good one? Worst case scenario, could I do it with a 3.2? 
         
3.) Time to graduation.   
         
It may take me five years to graduate (first semester of pre-req, semester of optional classes), or even 5.5 if I study abroad! 
**Note that the .5 years studying abroad may end up allowing me to take up a research opportunity or internship**    
         
Do grad schools care about fast graduation? 
        

                   
If you were me, right now, what would you be doing? Would you even go to grad school? 

                          
*yes, I do know that the general consensus in Engineering is that Grad school isn't far better than a bachelors degree* "
2mqoec,31,2014-11-18,I graduated from college in May and started my dream job yesterday. Here's how I did it.,CptPoo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2mqoec/i_graduated_from_college_in_may_and_started_my/,"As the title states, I graduated from college last May with my Master's degree and I've been applying to jobs and interviewing since January. Yesterday I started my dream job with one of the largest tech companies in the world earning a salary that is at the very top of what I wanted to earn. The last 10 months have been extremely challenging and frustrating; since January I've had over 30 interviews with more than 20 different companies. Out of that, I received three offers: two that offered me pitiful salaries (the same hourly wage I've made for the last two years) and the third was the job I started this week.

I learned a lot from browsing this subreddit, among other things, and I wanted to help others by laying out how I managed to get this job. It required a ton of persistence and hard work, but it's paid off in spades and anyone can do what I did if they just put in the effort.

1. **Get a degree.** A lot of people will try to convince you a college degree isn't worth it anymore. In a few instances this might be the case, but in general a degree forms a knowledge foundation that allows you to be more effective. Even a degree in the arts can give you knowledge that helps you be successful (my bachelors degree is in music, and it amazes me how much of it applies to the work I do in the tech industry). The key to getting a degree is to find a way to make it apply to the real world; colleges aren't very good at this so it comes down to your own motivation. It took me 4 years (out of 5 for my bachelor's) to figure this out, and I wish I had learned this sooner. A degree also greatly improves your chances of getting an interview; I know many of the interviews I got with recruiters happened only because I have an MS. A degree doesn't make you qualified for a job, but it does increase the likelihood that a recruiter will take a couple extra seconds to look over your resume while they are skimming through a hundred others. I will add one caveat, make sure there is a demand for a MS in your area of study before pursuing one.
2. **Become an expert in something specific and tangible.** You need to be able to separate yourself from the dozens of other people applying to the same jobs, and you can do this by spending time to learn as much as possible about a subject matter that is particularly important to you. I identified an area of the tech industry that is rapidly emerging and I spent hundreds of hours developing my understanding of it over the last two years. I did this primarily through starting my own news blog where I write articles daily about my particular expertise and over the last year and a half I've published nearly 1,000 short articles. Not only did this give me insight that few people have, but I now have a tangible asset I can show to any potential employers which demonstrates my understanding. 
3. **Never stop developing your technical skills.** This may not apply to everyone, but if you are looking to get a job or perhaps a better position than you are in now, it is vital to continually expand your technical skills. Spend time every single day improving your abilities, even if it is only for a few minutes. I spent numerous hours improving my technical writing, coding, and IT administration skills. Not everything is needed for my new job, but it all goes towards my overall understanding of the industry and makes me far more valuable to the company.
4. **Get experience by any means necessary.** I can't tell you the number of times I've been turned down from a job due to an unspecified “lack of experience” even though I've worked multiple part time jobs in the industry over the last 7 years (even three jobs at once). So I did exactly what I needed to: I got experience. I found non-profit organizations, citizen groups, friends, and whoever else needed my skills and I built up an expansive portfolio of work that I could show to potential employers. Over the summer I worked two unpaid internships: one that developed my technical skills, and another for a non-profit that is at the center of the industry I now work in (more on that later). 
5. **Build a brand.** When someone else thinks of you, they should think “hey, that's the person that knows a lot about [insert].” This goes right along with building an expertise and involves things like building an online presence, getting business cards, and identifying yourself as someone who does [x]. **Make yourself searchable.** I started using my middle name in all of my professional work because it allows people to do a Google search on me and find nearly two pages of results that are direct links to work I've done. In fact, I put “Google me” on the back of my business cards and I've had interviews with people who did exactly that after seeing some of my work on the web.
6. **Network network network.** I know, this sounds cliché, but for me it was the capstone in my job hunt. Remember that unpaid internship I did for a non-profit over the summer? It ended with me attending a major industry conference where I met my new boss. Since I spent so much time on the preceding five areas, I didn't even have to interview for this job because they could find everything they needed to know about me from my work scattered across the web and the mutual contacts we had. Everything else prepared me for the job, networking was what got me the job.

I won't lie, the job market sucks right now, especially for recent graduates. That doesn't mean you can't find a job doing what you love if you put in the time and effort. It won't be easy, but if you stick with it, things could end up working out exactly like they did for me. Feel free to ask me any questions about how I landed this job."
2mquft,1,2014-11-19,Overwhelmed at a Co-op Job is this a Early Warning,WhiteDoorSilver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2mquft/overwhelmed_at_a_coop_job_is_this_a_early_warning/,"Hey I know this might seem as an annoying question to most of you, considering how young (and naive) I am but I don't know where else to turn right now.

So im currently a seconds year Cs student working at my second Co-op (internship) job for the I.T department of a big insurance company, I received the job as a Java Web Developer, I'm grateful for this job but I do feel under-qualified. I'm really not that smart I get averageish grades with alot of hard work.

My first and only other real CSish job was doing web development where essentially I had a supervisor to help me out every step of they way.  However I wasn't really given any training or have anyone to show me the ropes for my current job and instead I was just put onto a small project with newly grads and another Coop student.

My manager and everyone else on my development team is located in another building in another city, we do have Instantly Messaging services and screen sharing services but it just doesn't feel enough for me as a way of communicating with my team.

They would often get together to work on problems together where as I am left alone to struggle with something I have never done (or even seen before) on my own.

And even when I ask for help, its never convenient and I often have to wait 90 mins for someone to give me a ""I don't know"". But I do make an effort to get all the help I can get. I really don't get many chances to communicate with my manager much either since hes a Project Manager working on various things, in another city. (Infact I have only seen him once after our interview) 

And during the last week we were getting close to our deadline but yet Im still struggling with my portion of the project. So I started taking work home and working on the weekends, working till 1 in the morning just experimenting and trying to figure out what is wrong with my code and the end still not making any progress.

Im not sure if its the situation that im put in thats giving me so much issues, or maybe its not the situation that in thats giving me so much trouble, maybe working from a remote location is very common in this field, maybe instead its my own incompetency.

What should I do? I want to better myself and learn more! and be able to do more! from this experience. But is this a warning that I am just not fit for this type of a job (maybe Im not adapting fast enough, maybe im not learning fast enough)?

Edit: Grammar!"
2mqupm,3,2014-11-19,"I am 19 and obsessed with escorts, femdom, pron and masturbation and it's ruining my life. How can I fix this?",IamDepresed,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2mqupm/i_am_19_and_obsessed_with_escorts_femdom_pron_and/,"I have been masturbating obsessively since I was 12. At first, it was just pictures of women. Then it turned into videos of girls dominating guys, mainly foot worship. Even more, now I'm obsessed with cuckolding videos.


At first, I would just watch these videos on my computer and masturbate. Then when I turned 18, I started seeing escorts. My first encounter with an escort involved me watching her have sex with her boyfriend (pimp) whilst she dominated and humiliated me. She spat on me, called me all sorts of names and made me eat her boyfriends cum. She also peed on me.


After the session, I felt so humiliated I thought I would never see an escort ever again. Not to mention it cost me upwards of $400 for only 20 mins. Although, I had paid for an hour, she kicked me out after only 20 mins.
Unfortunately, that was only the start. I have seen 20+ other escorts after this for similar scenarios. I feel humiliated, ugly and depressed. It's not that I particularly enjoy these fetishes. I feel as if I am too ugly and fucked up in the head to enjoy normal relationships. To add to this, I've never had a girlfriend.


After seeing all these femdom escorts, I thought maybe I should just try and have normal sex. I saw another escort who said I was cute. She was similar age to me and we had a great time. She even let me stay longer than normal because we had a ""connection"". In fact, we went out to get coffee after the session. I have never felt that way before. It was amazing to see that someone of her stature (she was a babe) found me attractive and enjoyed my company.


It was clear we could never have a relationship due to the circumstance in which we met. She ducked my calls and ignored me when I asked her if we could go on a normal date. I began feeling rejected, lonely and ugly once again. The cycle started all over again. I began seeing femdom escorts once again.


In total, I have spent $6000 in the past year just on escorts. It wouldn't be bad if I had a well paying job but the truth is that I am a university student. I pay for these bizarre fantasies using the money I earn during internships and student loans. Had I refrained from doing this, I would be graduating debt free.


In addition to me being broke, I am also on the verge of failing school. I constantly skip class, assignments and labs to indulge in my addiction. I went from being top of the class to barely passing. I'm at the best engineering school in my country. Just so you can understand the severity, I once skipped a midterm (worth 30%) to go see an escort in another city. I ended up getting a zero on it and my final mark was 65. Had I written the midterm, I would have managed to score a 90+ overall.


When my parents ask me about my marks, I tell them I studied but the test was just too hard. They think I'm always studying when in reality I'm just jerking off or seeing escorts


I tried to stop masturbating as well. The maximum I have gone is 4 days. I'm afraid I'm starting to lose my hair because of this as I started to notice some thinning on the side.


I'm at a total loss and I don't know what to do. This addiction is going to destroy me if I don't stop. I can't talk to any of my family member as a they are very religious and would shun me. Although I have some friends (more like associates), I can't share this with them as that would definitely ruin our friendship.


I figured it may be helpful to share my problem with the folks on reddit to see if they have any advice. I'll probably get banned for posting inappropriate material but I seriously need help. I'm depressed all the time and I hate my self. I'm a fucking loser.


I keep having suicidal thoughts as I feel unworthy of living in this world. At least With me gone, there will be one less fucked up loser in this world. However, every time I think about committing suicide, I end up not doing it because I'm too much of a pussy to hurt myself. 


It didn't always used to be this way. Although I was still watching femdom porn in high school, I was very athletic and what some may consider to be decently attractive. However, I have ruined all that and I'm sure I'll never be able to return to how I was. Unfortunately, their isn't a time machine or I would have used it a long time ago :(
Please help. I am on the brink of giving up on life. I'm not looking for pity as I damn well know this is all my fault. I just need a guiding hand.


I'm sorry for the rant. Believe me, I feel guilty for asking for help. I mean there are people in much more dire situations such as not having enough food or water or even drug addictions. And here I am bitching about my sex addiction. I feel like a filthy disgusting pig for having tcrying about my issues but it has really gotten out of my hand. I'm sorry, I just needed someone yo share this with. Too much crap on my chest right now."

I thought university would teach me a few things, raise my career ceiling and maybe give me a shot at the big 4.

I started my first semester like a blitzkrieg. I had enough savings to cover all of my expenses for over a year and a passion for the topic. I was not too happy about spending 4 more years in school, but I was there for the learnin', the earnin' and the opportunities.

By the end of the first semester, I was already about to drop out. I had not learned a single useful thing. I thought that the relevant stuff would come later and kept going. Fast forward 1.5 years later and I am even more bitter about the whole experience. 

The learning part simply isn't there. I've been disappointed by every remotely relevant class, and there haven't been that many. Most of them are all about outdated processes, verbose reports and busywork. There is very little room for useful information or experimentation.

The earning part? I can't tell. I'm passing tens of thousands of dollars worth of salary for a foot in the door I already have. Even if I make a solid $10k more a year with my degree, it'd take me about 20 years to cover the opportunity cost of spending 4 years in school. I don't even know if all that hard work will even give me an advantage.

Finally, there are the opportunities. The ones I get from school are worse that what I get through my website or LinkedIn. My internship salary is less than half of what I usually make. I liked to think my student status helped me secure my Nokia internship, but the interviewer told me they would have made an offer even if I applied as a full time software engineer.

I don't know what to think anymore. I have hated university from day one, but still worked to get good grades. However, I can't bring myself to study anymore because the whole ordeal seems pointless.

I go to a small private University in Austin, Texas that is of course overshadowed by the University of Texas. Austin, being a up and coming technical hub, I know I should be able to get many offers from right here in my city. 

My question is that my school's career services is not that strong, and neither are our job fairs. We have the occasional big company like IBM, but not enough new and young tech companies which are everywhere in Austin.

I was able to receive the opportunity to intern at Freescale Semiconductors here in Austin this summer, which is a very competitive internship and high paying. I worked with many Electrical Engineers so was often outmatched, but I am learning a lot. I know having this internship on my resume should draw a lot of interest for me even though they see that I went to my small school.

Also, I do have quite a few connections through my parents friends at companies like IBM, Dell, Freescale, National Instruments, but none at the new up and coming tech companies. Personally I see my self at a tech company that is trying to make a name for itself and is young and appeals to this new generation of software engineers that are not ""nerds."" If that makes sense haha

Finally, my question is where should I start to get some of these positions? Glassdoor.com, indeed.com, linkedin job posts? Or is there something else I can do with some of these companies being in my city?

Though I'm not a big drinker,  I didn't realize how quickly the drinks went to my head, and I got drunk.  My intern was asking me stories about my time in college (I went to a big school), and I let slip some sordid details about, as the HR coordinator would later say, ""my conquests."" My bad. 

I was excruciatingly embarrassed the next day.  But when everyone made jokes about it and laughed in a friendly manner, I figured I wasn't as bad as I thought.  When the intern and I were alone, I apologized for having a few too many and asked her if I was inappropriate towards her.  She told me I wasn't, and if it made her uncomfortable she wouldn't accept a ride home.   We got in my car, drove home, and all was good. 

My intern left for the summer but would occasionally text me, FB message, etc, all in a friendly manner.  Nothing sexual. Nothing inappropriate.  Just stuff about movies, her finally turning 21,  and even jokes about my ""conquests"" in college. She more-often-than-not initiated contact. The point is, she clearly wasn't angry/uncomfortable at me, and if she was initiating contact, she wasn't just being nice.

I have all these texts and messages saved. 

She came back this fall, and worked for few weeks part-time (10 hours). We haven't really chatted at all since she's come back. But I figured no big deal.  She's part-time, I'm busy. 

Her last day is this Friday. Yesterday, she had an exit interview, in which she complained about my behavior this past June, reasoning that she wishes that I will ""not treat future interns like I did her."" I'm completely dumbfounded.

According to HR, they want to hire her as a full-time employee, and she's a favorite of the VP of Marketing (my department).  I feel like I'm going to be ostracized/black balled.

2mu734,2,2014-11-19,Orlando Radiographer,hopefulninja,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2mu734/orlando_radiographer/,"This is my story. I got my degree in April for x-ray (radiography), something that I completely fell in love with. During my internship, I looked forward to each and every shift. There was nothing that I loved more than taking care of sick people. I would spend my day getting coughed on, sneezed on, vomited on, bled on (for free since I was interning) and I did not care. I wanted to change people's perception of the health care system and made so many people happy. I felt like I was making a change - even if it was a small one.

There was one hospital in particular that really liked me. I thought for sure they would hire me. While my classmates were sweating the market come graduation time, I felt confident. I even thought I was going to be the first one from my class to get a job. Boy, was I wrong! I made contact several times with the hospital after graduation, but none of the replies I was getting seemed too optimistic. ""We're not really sure what's going on with our staffing right now"" or ""we'll get back to you, there's a lot of change happening at the moment."" So comforting. Then it was finally ""we hired someone else."" Awesome, thanks for wasting a month of my life leading me on, my fault for having all of my eggs in one basket though.

Months went by with no luck and my optimism started fading away. Applications I filled out for other hospitals would go from ""received"" to ""not selected"" within a matter of days but my classmates were doing just fine finding jobs. I was getting no calls back and no interviews. It started taking a huge toll on my sanity seeing everyone's posts on facebook about their new job. I started feeling like there was something wrong with me that was keeping me from getting a job.

Had one really good interview about 5 months after graduation and the interviewer told me I was hired. You can imagine how ecstatic I was. On my way home I called everyone to share the good news. ""I finally did it!"" I felt so relieved, I even went out that night and blew all my money. I didn't care. I had a job and my life was going to get better now. Hiring manager said she'd call me by the end of the week. She didn't. The next week I called her, ""oh we're really busy right now but I promise you'll hear back soon."" Then it was ""we hired one person but there's another opening for you, don't worry."" Then it was ""we're fully staffed and we never promised you a job."" WAIT, WHAT?! UMMM...YES YOU DID. But obviously there's no arguing with the hiring manager, right? They are apparently always correct. Clearly I was hallucinating when she told me I had gotten the job.

After that fiasco was when I started getting really upset. Everyone kept asking me about my new job and I had to explain what happened. I felt so defeated and still do. It's been over 7 months now and I have nothing to show for it. My best friend from school found a job and is constantly telling me about all of the stuff she does in her hospital. ""Today I was in surgery and it was gross!"" ""Today I was with the newborns and they are so cute!"" Wow, must be nice. I remember when I was in surgery as a student, it was so much fun. I remember how cute the newborns were when I was interning. I wish I could be you right now.

So here I am, working a minimum wage job that is slowly draining my sanity and my faith in humanity away. Living in my parent's house. Have close to $15,000 in student loans to pay back, and I've already asked the government if I can put them off longer; they don't mind, they'll just pile on the interest. Losing motivation. I'm normally an extremely optimistic person but these past few months have been such a rollercoaster and it's really done a number on my self-esteem. I feel worthless, to say the least. I check job boards every single day and make phone calls/visits as often as I can't seem to get anywhere with anyone. Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine the life I want; my own place, a cat to keep me company, having dinner parties, complaining about bills. I just want to feel like I am actually an adult but I honestly feel like I'm in still a high school student."

I lack on skills that set me apart, I know that, but don't know what to specialize on.

So I currently have a research project in a field that I'm quite interested in (AI-related) at my university, which is relatively highly ranked for computer science in general. This is something I could take into the summer (potentially for credit but at least for the experience). I'm also applying to summer software engineering internships and have a second-round interview in a few weeks, but I haven't been faring especially well with other companies so far. I haven't taken a Data Structures and Algorithms course yet (will be taking it next semester) and while I've been trying to self-study much of the material, I still don't have a solid grasp of some of the concepts that interview questions cover. Over the next 1-2 semesters I'm confident that I can put in a good amount of time to go over algorithms books and coding interview books, but for this summer's recruiting period would working further on my research project be an acceptable alternative to an internship with a firm?

I don't feel obliged to get an internship simply because some of my peers are, and I'm interested in industry research in the long-term (IBM and the like), but I also don't want to hinder my career because of a decision to forgo interning for a summer.

Any advice would be helpful!"

I'm very excited to have received an offer for my first internship ever. It feels great that someone has recognized some potential in me, and I really want to get the most out of this experience. To both make sure that I learn the most I can, and to make sure that I am a positive asset for the company when I'm there.

During my 3 month stint I will be focussing on backend web development in Scala, which is a language I'm loving to learn, and the Play framework - which is also great.

I was wondering if there are any people here who have done internships, especially at smaller companies,  that could offer some advice. General tips on integrating into a small team? Not stepping on anyone toes. Things like that.

Thanks guys.

P.S: I have to say that without this community and /r/learnprogramming then I sincerely believe I would not have this internship. The amount of good advice on here, and nice people willing to help made the biggest impact on my (short!) professional life so far. 

Thank you all so much"

However, on the flip side, I find that a significant amount of my time is dedicated to running regular events weekly and doing all the little tasks that the other managers doesn't want to do.

       When I was growing up, like most young boys, I had such aspirations for myself. I wanted what most people
 wanted; a career I loved, a wife I cherished, and a life worth living. I believed I was the most astute and
 talented among my friends, but even if that was so, I did nothing but squander any potential. I went through 
the majority of my schooling unnoticed by most, gaining and losing a few friends along the way, largely 
miscreants and deviants like myself. This all changed when I entered my junior year in high school. For 
whatever reason that still eludes me this moment, I became popular with the rejects of society and when 
treading in these circles you tend to be surrounded by drugs and sex and I had a shortage of neither. These 
drug fueled club days ended in my early twenties when I realized that getting fucked up and failing out of 
community college wasn't going to get me any where. I was still as arrogant as ever although I had no basis to 
be, I was simply living in a chemically altered reality of lies and delusions of grandeur. This was the first 
moment in my life that reality struck me. What have I done with my 24 years of life on this Earth? A question I
 constantly asked myself. A question that has the simplest of answers, I threw it away. Wasted. However, 
I convinced myself that I was still young, that there was still time. 

	My life began to briefly turn around after this sober revelation. I realized something had to be done,
 that I needed to progress my life in a meaningful way. Many options were open to me, the Military was 
the first thing that came to mind. Perhaps the discipline would set me straight, but the commitment and 
hard work required scared me away from this option. Something I regret to this day is that I didn't have
 the courage to step forth, a reoccurring theme in my life. Another option was to buckle down and start
 doing well in community college and then hopefully move to a state university. No, I didn't choose this 
either, I didn't want to commit to a degree that I wasn't passionate about and I sacrificed job and financial
 security to pursue a degree in Computer Animation at a private university. I always loved the arts and 
was fairly talented. I loved the school and degree I chose. It was fast paced and alive, constantly changing 
and requiring my full attention. I graduated Valedictorian doing something I loved. “This was it” I thought,
 finally getting my break through. I worked hard to be on top and here I am. I had some friends from 
school try to help me get a internship. I turned that down. Another friend tried to help me get a local small
 time job to break into the industry. I turned that down. I had bigger ambitions. I wasn't going to be held 
back by doing internships and working at the bottom to build myself up. No, instead I created a company 
with a lifelong friend. I invested most everything into this company and we both had the skills we needed
 to succeed. But after nearly a year of my 'friend' never holding up his end of the bargain, it dawned on 
me that he had no interest in running his own business. I was left high and dry with a failed business that 
never got off the ground and burned bridges preventing me from getting into the industry I thought I loved.
 Once again I made the wrong choices. Arrogance.
	Luckily throughout all this I met the most amazing girl. We've been together for years now. 
I don't know why she's with me. She's successful and has a well paying job, she's ambitious and hard working. 
She's everything I'm not. But currently our relationship is loveless and void of any romance. This too is my fault.
 I cheated on her in the past. I betrayed any trust she had in me, I ruined her pure soul. I was her first real relationship.
 Of course at this point I had my share of women and treated her as just another one. Selfish. Arrogant. She stuck
 with me even though I insulted her love, her pure love. This poor girl deserves so much better, but I couldn't
 leave her, no. I needed her. I'm 28 and delivering pizzas in a car that struggles to keep running. I have $50,000
 and counting in student loans. And I make less than $8,000 a year. What am I without her? Without her I would
 very realistically be living on the street. Perhaps where I belong. This is likely why she stays with me. Because 
even after everything I've done to her she's such a loving person that she knows that if she kicked me out I have
 no where to go.
	I write this not for pity or attention, but to hold my self accountable in a way for throwing away more than
 most people in the world ever have. Here I am 28 years old making less than $8,000 delivering shitty pizza to
 ungrateful peoples door. I have an $80,000 degree I can't get a job with. This is what I deserve. This is the empire
 I built. I must wear this crown. Don't be like me. Be grateful for what you have. Don't be like me. Be humble and
 loving. Don't be like me. Achieve."

That's why I'm making this post today. Please bear with me on what could be a very long and tedious post to read because of its content and my terrible English (second language).

**Background information:** I'm a CS student that at some point lost track of what he was doing. A big part has to do with; being a minority with not the most fluent English. Having ADHD and not getting that taken care of because of cultural believes (aka ignorance). Being a first generation college student and not having the guidance necessary. As well as working two jobs on top of my academics. But when it comes down to it, all those things are just excuses and I'm not expecting the real world to cut me some slack because of it. Hence why I would really appreciate your help developing a game plan to get myself together. 

**Current situation:** I will be ending the first semester of my junior year in 2 weeks. I'm behind in my program and will most likely graduate a semester late (December 2016). My college career has been difficult and I'm barely getting by with a 3.0 GPA. Last semester I took a Data Structure and Algorithms class and nearly failed out of it, mainly because (I believe) my coding skills where not up to part. I feel like I had a good grasp of the content (enough to get by) but when it came down to assignments that required things like implement your own linkedlist, I struggled coding it and could not even go from a pseudo to actual code. Honestly I'm very ashamed to say it but I simply can't code. The worst part is that I'm retaking the class right now and although my grade will be much better, I'm stock in the same place. I was also planning on getting an internship this summer but with my skill level, minimum GPA, and nothing to show on my resume. That will most likely not going to happen.

**Game plan:** This is where I need your advice. I really want to turn my life around and become a software developer. The problem, there are actually too many resources out there and I can't decide what to do. I was thinking about doing the following:

**By mid-January:**
- Go through this course on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DF6E4B45C36D411) to help me with my coding skills.
- Complete this Data Structure course on [MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/), which also uses CLRS and I've seen many people recommend this book.

**After:**
- Start CTCI, maybe I get lucky and get an interview? if not it doesn't hurt.
- Try to start a project, which right now I have no idea how. But I'd figure it out later.

If you made it to this point, thank you! Really, even if you have nothing to say I still appreciate that you care enough to read it. Now, does my plan sound like something that could work? Or would I be wasting my time reading and completing those courses? If so, what do you recommend I do?

I'm back with the announcement that everything's been set up, and the event is planned!

I work at LinkedIn, where each month we hold a special day called ""inDay"" during which employees are encouraged to spend time on something outside of work that's important to them. Whether that's helping others, learning a new skill, or just relaxing, inDay is a day to do something other than your job.

As part of our inDay, I've assembled a team of engineers and web developers who are dedicating part of their day to holding one-on-one mock technical interviews with you. You'll solve real interview questions, and afterwards the interviewer will provide you immediate candid feedback on areas you might want to focus on.

We can handle both **back-end** and **front-end** interview candidates. For this round, we don't have the ability to offer interviews in fields like systems administration or site reliability.

If you are **looking for internships** or you're a **new college graduate**, or if you just haven't interviewed in awhile, we would love to help you practice your interview skills!

Match emails will go out to interviewers around Dec 1, and they'll email you directly to set up a time that works well for both of you. I will also email everyone at that time to let you know if we were able to match you. We will try to handle as many people as we can, but I have a pretty small group. If the event is successful I will definitely try to hold it again in the future.

I'm in New Zealand in case it matters. My situation: *1 semester left next year 2015, graduating in July or so.

*Got an internship this summer (November to end of Feb) at a very very successful company in the healthcare sector.

*Grades are OK. B average with A grades in management, planning etc. I specialised in Internal Combustion Engines for my specialisation, which I chose over doing Operations Management specialisation.

*I am very hands on, love working on things, endless ideas for contraptions and mechanisms. Good problem solving skills.

My problem: *My role currently is in Operations Engineering. I didn't choose it, I got put in it. Continuous improvement, cutting time and costs... that sort of thing. I always though I'd rather do that/management than be a design engineer but now that I'm doing it. I HATE IT! It's boring me to death.

*I see the work the product design and other design engineers do and I envy them so much. I feel like I wasted my whole degree learning maths, design skills, thermodyamics and all sorts just to end up doing Ops.

*Even though I hate Ops, I am working my ass off. Trying to impress and trying to do the best I can. My manager is highly impressed even after my first week and I can only get better!

My question:

*Should I continue with ops if they offer me to come back as a graduate? The company helps you to work towards a field you would like to work in, as in I could develop myself to be a design engineer eventually but it seems risky... Is ops the way to go? Is it a better field? It doesn't seem like it. Even the senior ops engineers have a very dull job by the looks of things compared to the senior design engineers.

*Should I maybe just be straight up front with them and say I want to be a design engineer or nothing?

The company pays extremely well and the possibilities are endless and I would have an extremely bright career path with them. However if I don't get a design role, I feel like I should settle for a lesser job elsewhere that still lets me do design work. I feel that if I don't use my design skills I'll lose the basics I learnt at uni and find it difficult to get back in to.

I feel like I can excel highly at ops but be an OK to good design engineer.

What do you guys reckon?

How do I transition to a new career with no immediate direction?,Badovs-Roc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2mzz2n/need_a_career_change_at_30_due_to_stressloss_of/,"I've got the job I had always wanted since I was 10 years old(video coordinator in Football), and after 5 years of doing it full time post college I don't think I can do it anymore.  I'm currently working about 90-100 hours a week and I average 75+ over the course of the year.  Largely because of the hours I've lost my passion for the job and my health and relationships have suffered greatly as a result.  I've pursued similar jobs to mine elsewhere but wasn't successful and I feel it has hurt my advancement opportunities(not that they were all that great to begin with) at my current employer.  I've reached a point where I'd almost rather be unemployed than come in to work tomorrow.

I've got a bachelors degree is sports management(I know...but that degree + internships got me where I thought I wanted to be).  Aside from a 3 month stint doing customer support at a software company this is the only work I've done since high school.  I don't really know what I want to do, the only career I ever had a passion for was the one I'm in now and that passion is long gone.  

I currently make about $55k/year and have ~$20k in student loan debt.  I have very little tying me down to my current location so I'd be willing to mov just about anywhere.  Money is not a huge motivator for me, but I'd like to avoid going deeper into debt without any direction or promising job prospects.  I'd love to find a new career where I can start at the bottom and work my way up, but I don't know where to look since all my work experience is in a pretty niche field that I want a clean break from.  I'm not against going back to school, but I'd like to have an idea of what I want to do rather than blindly taking classes looking for a purpose.

I've looked briefly into computer science/programming, and I definitely had an interest in IT at one point before I started on my career path.  I might be interested in pursuing that again as there seems to be demand.  I hit a wall mentally in math shortly after high school and veered away from that path, so my math skills are beyond rusty and i feel like that would be a huge hurdle initially(not dismissing it, just trying to be open).  I've looked into programming bootcamps as a way to get into that field and that feels like an attractive option if I were to commit to that field.  I feel like this is an option but I can't for sure say I'm passionate about it.

Has anybody else started a career change without having a good idea of what direction they wanted to go in? My most immediate concern is honestly getting out of my job, as I'm struggling mentally and physically keeping up with the demands of it and the effect it has had on my relationships and personal life in general is making me pretty depressed.  I really want to stay positive but I think I need to get out very soon."

I study computer engineering in europe and I would really like to spend the next summer with an internship in the US. I'm currently working on my bachelor thesis, although I'm already doing the first semester of the CE master course. Since I've never applied for a job outside of my own city, I've got a few general questions I hope some of you can answer: 

* How does the application process for internships usually work out in the US?
* What's the salary like for CE/CompSci internships?
* Do companies set a high value on GPA?   
* What criteria do employers generally use when reviewing students' applications?

My CE course does not include a lot of analogue circuitry, so I'm looking for a job in either FPGA, µController development or some hardware-related software engineering. Do you think I've got a chance to score a internship in this area? 

I'm grateful for any tips or insight on internships in the US in general! "
2n071x,1,2014-11-21,Career decision,data_456,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2n071x/career_decision/,"I am currently working for a company that provides business intelligence and data mining solutions for big companies in various sectors (banking, energy, government etc). It's my first job; I've been here for 3 months (and last year, as an intern, for about 9 months).
I've started to work here because data mining is my passion and I wanted to learn much about it. What I've learned is, however, that their focus is on mostly BI (data warehouses, OLAP, ETL). Only a fraction of their work is about what we call data science. The tools we use are mainly SAS and SQL, and mostly we use it for ETL and data processing.
In the last 3 months I did not have the opportunity to show my skills and use my knowledge in advanced analytics. My boss, a well-known veteran of data, is aware of this and promised that in the long term, I would spend 30-40% of my time with data mining.


Recently, I found a new job opportunity that seems interesting. A company in IT security is right now building up a team of data scientist to design and build data models for their new intelligent, data-driven product. They are players in the international market, which is quite rare for a company from my country. The data scientists there are using open-source tools like R and Python. A friend of mine works there, enjoying his work. He set up and interview for me with the CTO, which went well, and I'm quite sure that I'm going to get an offer.


I've tried to think about as many aspects of changing jobs as possible. This 2nd company is clearly more innovative and has higher ambitions (international product, international conferences etc.). And there I could do data science at a deep level which I think of as exciting but I have no chance of doing at my current employer.

However, I feel I still could learn many things at my current job, both technical (BI, SAS, SQL) and soft skills (meeting more clients, thinking about business problems). I sort of fear that if I quit, I could lose the chance to learn more about these stuff. The 2nd company is clearly specialized in a particular market (IT security) while at my current company I can face several business problems coming from various markets, which is always interesting. I feel that if I quit, my knowledge about business will be too specific, and that would be a limit of my possibilities in my future career.


Could you give me other perspectives? Do you think the fears descirbed are valid? I realize I'm maybe overthinking it but I'd love hear your ideas.

A lot of the resumes I'm seeing say they're looking for a 1-semester internship.

What's your perspective on co-oping vs interning?

With the kind of programming my company does, we don't see a lot of value in interns. Sure, if you want to come write documentation for us for a few months, we could always use the help. But in terms of getting practice with software development, co-op is a much better fit for us, because there's so much about our software that you need to learn in order to be useful. Even experienced full-time developers take 3-6 months before they're able to really contribute.

So what's your opinion? As a student, what's your advantage to interning instead of co-oping?"

I have never had an internship before, so I am unsure whether or not I should take this opportunity or keep searching for a more ""traditional"" type of internship for this summer. I often see people in this subreddit say things like ""you shouldn't do any unpaid work"" or something similar to that. However, my search for an internship for this summer has not been very successful thus far, and this opportunity is basically being handed to me. I am just not sure what is the right decision to make or if this opportunity is even comparable to a ""real"" internship.

 I want to pursue mobile development, but I am confused about what would look better on my resume as well. Also, if I was to take this opportunity and developed the full app, would I list it on my resume as an internship or would it be more like ""contract"" work?

I am a 22 year old new college graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering but hoping to do software. I currently work at a software development firm, taken on as a software dev intern over the last summer and kept on part time this semester (I still have a few weeks of classes before I get the diploma).

I love coding, I go to as many hackathons as I can and I love building things, but I have very little training as a computer scientist/programmer. I'm mostly self taught, and only took a couple of required intro cs classes in college.

I've been self teaching for almost a year (I got my first codecademy badge on January 8, 2014), so I'm new at this but I love it and I'm learning fast.

I have made lots of webapps and android apps, as well as scripts etc to accomplish various tasks.

I have a [github](https://github.com/johnpc), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncorser), and a [couple](http://johncorser.com) of [personal sites](https://johnpc.github.io). 

I mostly like Rails/angular for web and Java for android, but I'm flexible regarding technologies.

My problem right now is, I'm about to graduate, and I don't know what kinds of jobs to apply for. I've been interviewed (and subsequently rejected) by many handfuls of tech giants/big name startups in the SF area, and I think it's time for me to lower my standards and accept that I should work someplace less prestigious. 

Where can I apply? And what role would I be qualified for? Most small companies that I've checked out aren't hiring new grads (the require 3+ years of experience and want someone that can actually do stuff rather than someone that they'd have to kind of train).

I go to a small private University in Austin, Texas that is of course overshadowed by the University of Texas. Austin, being a up and coming technical hub, I know I should be able to get many offers from right here in my city.
My question is that my school's career services is not that strong, and neither are our job fairs. We have the occasional big company like IBM, but not enough new and young tech companies which are everywhere in Austin.
I was able to receive the opportunity to intern at Freescale Semiconductors here in Austin this summer, which is a very competitive internship and high paying. I worked with many Electrical Engineers so was often outmatched, but I am learning a lot. I know having this internship on my resume should draw a lot of interest for me even though they see that I went to my small school.
Also, I do have quite a few connections through my parents friends at companies like IBM, Dell, Freescale, National Instruments, but none at the new up and coming tech companies. Personally I see my self at a tech company that is trying to make a name for itself and is young and appeals to this new generation of software engineers that are not ""nerds.""

My question is this: how do I position myself for internships?

How do I sell myself in this kind of situation?

I think telling my story here might help me calm down and think things through more clearly, she was always the one that was better under pressure not me, i never thought i'd find myself in a position where I would literally have her life on my hands. Empathy might help people get more envolved with our story so maybe telling you guys a bit about us is mandatory, i think.
 I've thought long and hard these past few hours since I managed to run away and this is the only hypothesis that actually made sense.

 I live in a small farm house just about 40min away from the centre of Montreal. The farm has been on my family for many many years and it ended up in my hands. My mom died of cancer when i was very little and my dad is currently in a nursing home because he has Alzheimer's in a very advanced state.
 For many some years I couldn't care less about it, I was an average law student who just started college when my dad had the outbreak that forced me to deal with the fact that he could no longer take care of himself.  When I finished university I was also an average attorney and in a town where there are a lot of amazing lawyers you can imagine my life was far from what i dreamed for me. 

 I am not a carer, i don't care about anything or better said, i was not a carer until I met Laura. She was a very successful accountant, besides that she was also soft at heart. She did charity events, volunteered in animal shelters,you get the picture, she led her life the best and the most correct way possible. 

 It was on one of those events that we met and i think the only reason she took interest in me  was because i was oozing helplessness. I was her own charity project. I always thought she had a bad case of saviour complex but after sometime of dating her i realized she did upgrade my life to another level. I was dressing better, looking better, enjoying life more, i even found myself helping her in her good will stuff. I was, i have to admit, more proud of what i had become than i had ever been in my life. 

 The only thing that was ruining this picture perfect scenario was my job. Besides failing miserably in every other case, the ones i actually managed to be good was when i was defending guilty people. Turns out i'm very good at defending people when i know they are lying about their innocence and realising that the only way i was ever going to successful was by defending murderers was slowly crushing my spirit.

Laura saw this before I ever did, she was always two steps ahead on me in everything that had to do with emotional intelligence so she spent two years convincing me that maybe, if we were going to live together which was inevitable by now, we should move back to my family farm. I'd shown a growing interest on biological agriculture and well plants in general and she was running out of space to keep all the stray dogs she got off the streets and then refused to put them up for adoption. 

I confess that i was reluntant as i was finally getting somewhere law wise but after two years of reflexion i agreed in reducing my cases and moving to my parents house. She could work at home since her job could be done anywhere, she is a city child so living in the country was this big adventure that was she was looking forward to. I had a bad feeling about it but i just blamed it on my unhappy childhood memories and the solitude of the countryside. I wished I followed my gut but i had no way of even imagining this, truth be told i could never say no to Laura. Not after all she's done for me.

And that's how we've been living for the past 3years. Laura is happier than she's ever been, or at least she looks like it: she has cats that aren't exactly ours they just pass by to say hi everyday; she had her dogs that she likes to give food names to like apple pie and struddel and crumble and petit gateau, she loves the corn fields i planted on the farm and she loves her small herbarium where she keeps all the stuff she needs to make her healthy cooking. Me? I love her and that's more than enough to make it all better than our previous life.

Until last night.

Even if I keep most of my time at home, sometimes I still defend a case in the city because i miss the crowds and the rush. Last week after i left the court i was approached by the other part's intern that had been helping with the case. She was impressed by the way i won the case with so little that the accusation could do to stop me and she asked if i would have a beer with her before going home. She was a small, beautiful thing and she was 22 at best and i might, just might be slightly attracted to her but truth be told the only reason i said yes to her proposition was to indulge my ego. I could have just skipped this part and make you think i was this loyal, dedicated wife but i think i shouldn't for three reasons: first, it might come up in the future investigation and i don't want you all to think i'm a phony; secondly, i'm not perfect but i do love Laura, i would never cheat on her even if i'm obviously playing with fire sometimes; and last but not least, if it wasn't for Veronika i would have even less clues about what happened last night. 

During our time at the bar we talked about a lot of stuff, we flirted a bit i admit but it was all very candid specially because i kept using my left hand to gesture and my wedding was always awkwardly showing. You might say i'm an hipocrite and i don't deny it not for a moment. At some point she started telling me about this rumour that was running around town that some sort of religious cult was making it's establishment  on the outskirts of town. Veronica mentioned she didn't exactly know what they were about or their beliefs but she had two highschool friends who left their life behind to join them.

Some say they are the kind of cults who believe on wierd things like there's a space ship riding a comets tail that is the passport to another dimension and eventually commit mass suicide and the other rumours mention some messianic stuff, about the apocalipse and purification of earth. She even mentioned that she suspects recent increase of missing people in Montreal is not a random coincidence but the direct result of their cult actions. I asked if she isn't watching/reading too much true crime fiction and she proceded to try and explain to me how most of the urban legends created online are actually happening right now all over the world and she recommended this place to me in case I wanted to broad my knowledge of the world. Her words exactly. 
I laughed it off as youth's eagerness to believe in everything and noticed how late it was getting and ended our ~date~ right there. 
 We left the bar and i was still laughing it off and when she kissed my cheek she whispered' careful, you and your wife might be next! You live too isolated, it would probably be a long time before anyone knows you are missing'. I laughed at the time, I brushed it off as she trying to be creepy sexy ( it's a thing believe me). I wish I'd paid more attention to what she said. I wish, at least, i'd stop and think how come she knew where i live...i only mentioned i had a long drive.

I was an idiot, i regretted even accepting the beer as soon as I got my car. Yes, my ego was rubbed but it was just that and it was never going to be worth losing my wife's trust. I'm an idiot and she knows it better than anyone but one day she'll stop thinking i was ever worth her time. The only way i have of proving my worth is getting her alive from the mess we're in and start over. Somewhere else because I'm never sleeping another night at that place.

This is all I had to tell you guys of the times that preceded what happened last night now to what brought me here.

I didn't comment anything about the goddamn cult with Laura, first because she would brush it off and secondly because she is the most profound atheist i know. She would immediatly put a label of crazy people being crazy on the subject and laugh everytime that i mention it. Crazy religious people are as likely to cross her path as aliens in her mind so she would end the subject even if i brought it up. I'm curious more than anything so i did read stuff about them, their activity and so on, i went on their official website and it looked like your average cult. You pay something to help the church and then you have your little piece of heaven assured, you know the type. It did have an elite within the cult, i found some people commenting in foruns that they existed but knew nothing about what it was about. I grew more and more interested but then i had to accept another case in town and dedicated myself to it.

So last night i got home a little late ( I know what you are thinking, no I did not see Veronica after that time at the bar, I just had some stuff to read and I couldn't bring the archive home because it was classified as confidential) and I find these strange women having tea at my place. 
Laura is happily entertaining, happy to have company i guess, i see that they are all dressed in purple and i think they look at us wierdly. I signal Laura to follow me to the porch and as we leave the women with their tea I try to get my wife to explain what's going on. She said these nice ladies came to present themselves since they were moving nearby. That they live in a religious community and they like to know their neighbours. I don't know if it was because i'd read all that stuff online about the cult, the more Laura talked the more I suspected those people and obviously argued with her about letting strangers in. I sounded paranoid i realised but I was absolutely creeped out. I had Veronika's last words on loop in my head and as I said before,  my wife is the best dealing with stressful situations.She just looked at me like i had grown an extra head and shook her head going on and on about how she just wanted to be friendly and how she was actually relieved to have some actual company since i was never home lately. Then she stormed out on me which she never did before, that's when I realized how right she was about me never being around. So I lowered my head and decided to play nice. I wish i didn't.

The women stayed for dinner and i endured their salvation crap for the entire time almost silently. I watched how my wife who would have scoffed everything sat there, talking happily about the Lord just to keep them there, to keep them talking. I thought guilty on how lonely she must have felt these last few days if she is actually endulging this nonsense. You see, Laura was kicked out of her parents house because their religion couldn't deal with a gay daughter. These people seem accepting but you never know.

After they left, we continued our conversation now without anger. She asked me if it had been such a discomfort to be nice to our neighbours and i tried once more to explain why I was so creeped out but she didn't actually listen. At least i know we didn't go to bed angry.

In the middle of the night, I was having trouble sleeping so decided to get a glass of water from the kitchen and found that everything was strangely silent. I mean, we have several dogs and cats and we are in the middle of the country side there's always noises around us. But not tonight and the silence was really innerving. As soon as I turn to go back to bed, I see a shadow with the side of my eye, immediately something hits my head and I pass out.

When i come to my senses I was on the back of a van and Laura is beside me passed out. I try to wake her up but she is not responding in any way.

I had to decide to either go with through with the journey and probably die at the destination or try to escape now and go after them and try to save my wife. There's no way I can jump on a moving van with her passed out, not without risking bumping her head on the road and being the causer of the death of the person I love the most in the world. So I manage to kick the back door, I don't know with what strength, and roll into the road. I hear the van hit the breaks and i manage to get up and run to the middle of the forest besides the road. I hide but i can hear them saying, it sounded like the voice of one of the women that was at the house but it can be just my mind playing tricks, ' don't worry about that one, we only need one of them anyway'.

 I heard the doors closing and the van driving off and I broke down. I finally cried all the stress out, in the middle of the woods and I didn't leave til morning. 

I didn't dare to go home, so I walked to the city instead. I waited beside the office building where I knew Veronika worked and asked for her help. I know, i know... But I didn't tell her anything, just said that I was in trouble and needed her tablet and some clothes. It was the only thing that occured to me. I found a cafe with wifi and I am writing you this looking like shit with borrowed money and borrowed clothes. I need ideas desperately. I can't believe this nightmare is happening to me.

EDIT: I managed to call an ex-client of mine and he has resources, you know what I mean. I'm going to find that cult. it had to be them, who else could have taken her. I'm just waiting for an employee of his to come get me and take me to his headquarters.

2n3fu0,5,2014-11-22,Stick with a job I hate so I don't look like a job hopper on my resume?,vnk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2n3fu0/stick_with_a_job_i_hate_so_i_dont_look_like_a_job/,"Right now I'm working at my first full-time job after college. I've been there about six months, but it's really burning me out already. The workload is enormous, every day is insanely stressful, the benefits suck, and I'm working long/odd/sometimesweekend hours.


I knew when I graduated that I was probably going to have to ""pay my dues,"" so to speak, and take a job I didn't particularly love. But my current job is downright unhealthy. I barely have time to eat anything during the night, and I find myself running back and forth to the bathroom to minimize the time away from my desk. Heck, I even have nightmares about missing deadlines at work. Things don't look like they'll improve either; in the unlikely event I were promoted, I'd be looking at even more responsibility and more hours for a marginally-higher salary.

I'm tempted to take another job as soon as I can (even for lower pay), but I'm afraid that having a mere six-month stint on my resume is going to scare off potential employers. Before my current job I held several internship positions, and those were short-term gigs. 

Some friends have advised me to stick it out for at least a year and then start applying elsewhere, while others say my highest priority should be getting out of my current position.

Thoughts?"
2n3lxz,5,2014-11-22,Hiring interns vs co-ops,BigPeteB,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2n3lxz/hiring_interns_vs_coops/,"Some background: I'm a full-time software engineer at a small company (about 15 people) doing embedded development. I'm also looking to hire some co-op students.

I'm noticing the buzz these days is all about internships, not co-ops (if you haven't heard of co-oping, it's basically a recurring internship, and usually alternates semesters instead of being summer-only). 10 years ago when I was going through school, they pushed co-ops heavily. Advantages they cited were that you get to learn more and work on harder projects, because you have enough time with one company to learn the details of what they work on.

My boss agrees with that advantage; there's a lot to learn about our software and field, so hiring someone who will take up 3 months of our time in training and then disappear forever doesn't make much sense.

But on the resumes I'm getting, most students say they're looking for internships. And I hear about interns making crazy amounts of money; some are being paid more than I am as an experienced full-time engineer (one intern said he got $2000/week). Needless to say, my small company doesn't have that kind of money to throw around.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. Suddenly I feel like I'm out of touch with what's happening in the rest of the industry.

For employers: how does a small company compete for student talent (either current students or fresh graduates)? I get the sense that I need to be more proactive about seeking out skilled students, but I really don't know what the best ways to do that are.

For students: how do I convince you that it's worthwhile to work for us, given that we're never going to be able to pay you as well as Google or Facebook?"

(Computer science)",[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2n439a/what_should_be_my_course_of_action_right_now/,"After high school I decided that the route I wanted to take was to go to community college for two years then transfer to a four-year university to earn a Bachelor's degree in computer science. This allows me to save a lot of money on tuition.

Now I'm in my second year of community college and am on track to graduate with an associates degree in spring of 2015. It's almost time to apply for my transfer. Since shortly after high school, I have been working part time in food service while going to classes. So now I'm wondering about how to fit internships into this, because I need experience in my actual field. But for me this is all just a big question mark. I have no idea where to start on internships.

Here are a few of my questions: when am I ready for an internship? After I transfer to university and start actually working on the meat of my CS major, or could I start applying now despite my limited programming experience? How much programming ability am I expected to bring to an internship, and how much will they teach me? Should I be working on a portfolio, doing programming projects in my spare time so I can get ahead of class material? As of now I have only taken 2 programming classes (in Java), because that's all they offer at my community college, so I feel I am very far from being able to work on an actual piece of software. If I continue working in food service one more year, will that look negative on my resume?"

I'm fairly limited to my job opportunities because of financial matters, such as not having a car, so I've been looking for cs related jobs close to or on campus. There are internships at software companies but they are 20-30 min drives or 1 hour bus rides to downtown which aren't viable to me.

I currently have two job opportunities, one at a local business to do web dev and another as a software engineer intern. The only difficult part is that the internship requires me to take a 30 min bus ride so its a little inconvenient while the web dev position is a 10 min walk.

2n4vnq,2,2014-11-22,Have I been a bitch to my boyfriend?,gorillagangsta,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2n4vnq/have_i_been_a_bitch_to_my_boyfriend/,"Backstory: My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years now. He's basically been my college sweetheart and we started dating in our junior year. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. He's super sweet, kind, caring - but we've both entered a rough patch and it's been hard for both of us. After graduation, he immediately got a job in his field. It's a one year contract, and his parents found him a nice apartment in a town 3 hours away and paid for the first months' rent.

Currently: I've been depressed. Not because of him being away, but my current situation. My mom hasn't worked for the past two years because she's always sick, whether it's from her nerve pain, arthritic pain, everything. I'm the oldest, so I'm pitching in 50% of our rent. I've been doing retail until I can find a decent full-time job, and I can't afford to move to another state. I have a younger sister who goes to school full-time and also has a job to support the family, along with two roommates who help with the other half of the rent. We've had cash assistance and food stamps for the past 5 years since my dad won't pay child support (although now, he technically doesn't have to pay for me since I'm over 21).

I have the skill set needed for a job in my field, but I can't catch a break. And every time I'm on Facebook I feel like every other person has a job or an amazing paid internship. All of that combined has really hurt my ego and I've just felt completely depressed for months. I contemplate suicide regularly, but I won't do it since I know that'd just be the easy way out, and things always get worse before they better.

Me and my boyfriend: My boyfriend is always sweet to me and tells me that things will get better. But he also complains to me about his job everyday. He talks about how much he hates being away from me and his friends, and how he refuses to make friends at his new place. I can't help but get so angry with him because he doesn't even realize how well he has it. His parents have helped him with everything - he has no loans, a nice apartment, and they won't take rent from him once he moves back home from work. My apartment is the nice of his basement. And yeah, I get to see our friends everyday, but I can't afford to. We got into a fight today because I told him, through text, that I contemplate jumping off my roof. He called me twice afterwards, so I told him to leave me alone because I didn't want to talk to him or anyone else, and I will just continue to apply to jobs. He said, ""Do what you want.""

I said, ""I love you, btw."", about an hour later. He said, ""Then show it.""

Yeah, I know, terrible communication skills, but I wasn't in any mood to speak to him over the phone. Be blunt people, have I been terrible?"

The invitation seemed intentionally cryptic, and it only said that it's purpose was to talk to top tech students in the state. The focus group ended up being very intimate - only about five students were there including me - and we talked for over an hour and a half with the head of engineering, the heads of recruitment, and the person in charge of college relations.

Despite the fact that this was never specified to be a recruitment session, most of the students were constantly alluding to wanting to work there, and everyone seemed really eager and were treating the session like a job interview. They toured us around the office and gave us food and emphasized things like their company culture in a very recruitment-esque way.

The actual session featured a lot of personal questions, asking about our hobbies and skills and backgrounds, then transitioned into questions about what we looked for in companies and what we thought made a good employer. They were taking very scrupulous notes, even during the parts when we were just talking about ourselves

Then, when it was over, they told us that they would keep our emails for ""future opportunities"" (again cryptic). I received an email thanking me and giving me the emails of the recruiters and head of engineering with nothing but the note that I should ""feel free to contact them with anything.""

I'm not sure what to make of this. Am I just totally misreading this? Was this legitimately just a focus group, or were they trying to recruit us? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to send to the email addresses I was given, and I would feel strange just sending my resume to them and asking about internships (they have none posted online, so I'm assuming they recruit in-person only). Anyone have any advice on how to read this situation?

tl;dr Got invited to a company ""focus group"" that went well, but now not sure how to turn this into a bigger opportunity."

This coming week I'll be interviewing for a position with the company I currently work for. I work as an IT Administrator on a team with one other IT admin and a couple help desk employees. It will be myself and the other IT Admin interviewing for this position. The position will start as a mix between technical and managerial, however with our growth I am sure the position will become mostly managerial soon enough (I'll be asking this question in the interview). 

I have interviewed potential employees for positions in our department before, and because of that feel like I would be more than comfortable being interviewed again for this position (I was hired in as Help Desk and was promoted, so I never had to interview for my current position). I realize a position as a manager will bring different questions and topics in the interview than what I'm used to talking about. That is why I'm hoping to turn to you guys for any help you can offer. I have a list of possible questions that I'm preparing for, and am coming up with some I want to ask myself, but am open to hearing from as many resources as I can find!

What questions or topics of discussion should I be prepared for most?

What questions should I ask the panel of people interviewing me?

What should I avoid talking about or make a point to talk about?

As for my resume that I am touching up now, what are some things I should keep in mind? Should I still include short term internships I had in high school and college? (I have been out of college for 4 years, and have had 2 internships and 2 jobs in the field throughout my life). 

I appreciate any advice or heads up on anything I listed or may have not thought of!

**TL;DR:**

* Applied to 2 university jobs.
* In job #1, I meet all of the qualifications, yet didn't get an interview. The son of an employee that IMO was less qualified was hired.
* In job #2, I met all of the qualification, yet didn't get the interview.  The relative of an employee with almost the exact same qualifications was hired.
* Want to know if there is any legal recourse?

First a little background on myself:  I'm a 4-year military veteran that recently graduated with a degree in computer science and IT.  I graduated this May and have been looking for a job since my internship ended in August.

In July I saw that two positions were available at my alma mater that I was more than qualified for.

---

The job requirements for job #1 were:
&gt;""...an associate degree in a technology related field or two years of experience providing information and/or instructional technology support.
&gt;
&gt;""...applicants must have a strong working knowledge of computer technology and hardware, audio/video systems, and video conferencing related equipment, a thorough knowledge of methods for troubleshooting IT equipment issues, effective verbal and written communication skills with the ability to interpret and deliver technical guidance demonstrating strong interpersonal skills.

Preferred requirements for job #1 were:
&gt;""...applicants will have expertise with Interactive Video (ITV) conferencing and/or web streaming technology used for instructional delivery and in instructional design support.""

---

The required job requirements for job #2 were:
&gt;""a baccalaureate degree in Computer Science or related field""

Preferred requirements for job #2 were:
&gt;""Six months experience in a System/Network Management or Technical Support position is preferred (internships acceptable).
&gt;
&gt;""Preferred candidates will have experience with system and network administration and the ability to design, develop, implement, and administer tools to effectively manage IT infrastructure systems using a wide variety of operating systems, programming/scripting languages, databases, utilities and application tools. Candidates should also have strong team, communication, and project skills.""

---

Since I have a BS with two majors that are technology-related, and 2+ years experience (I was a student worker for the department I applied for), and a vet, I was sure that I would at least make it to get an interview.  (I had previously applied to the job #1 in October before graduating, had a phone interview, but not an in person interview, and found out later that none of the people who made it through to on-site interviews had decided to accept the position and that they would start the search again in approximately 6 months.  This leads me to believe that I was obviously qualified from job #1 the first time the position was open.)

The hiring process took an extended time this go round.  I heard nothing for months, asked people I was friendly with that worked there, etc.  I eventually e-mailed the head of the department in September to see how it was going, and was told that it might be a while as the process was in progress still.  Again, I heard nothing back officially on the positions.

I found out today that the positions had been filled.

The person that was hired for job #1 however is the son of a woman that works in the department.  The thing is, he has a communications degree and his work experience is relatively similar to mine (working as a student worker for his mother in the department) except that he worked in the department longer.

The person that was hired for job #2 is also related to a person that works in the department, although I'm not 100% what the relationship is (either uncle-nephew, cousins of some sort).  He has the nearly the same qualifications as I do, as we are friends and graduated within 5 months of one another and worked at the same student worked job together.

It seems that in both cases I'm equally if not more qualified for the job, and was passed over for people who were related to current employees.  In both cases I'm pretty sure that veteran's preference would apply to either position.

Long story short, I'm curious if there is any legal recourse in this matter?"

I have dealt with quite a bit of depression on and off over the past 15 years and wished for death, but this is the first time that I can clearly see myself grabbing a knife and slitting my wrist. I already had it there during my shower today but pulled it away. 


I just finished college and have just started a job in my field. Its miserable, nothing makes sense, I struggle to relate to any of my 20+ years older coworkers, and I just feel like a fool after every question I ask. I already feel like I won't survive if I don't get out now and so intend to quit tomorrow, but between the misery that is this and that was my internship, I feel like I've just wasted the last 4 years of my life on something I've grown to hate and am completely lost as to anything else to do except minimum wage jobs or sales, which I also hate.

My family outright ignores me. I live with my brother and his wife right now and no one batted an eye when I started going immediately to bed after work or when I spent all of Saturday in my room, even skipping meals(all there is is a bed in there, so its not like I could've been watching tv or something). No acknowledgment of me at all right now. Not to mention hundreds of other times they ignored or forgot me, plus the many times my brothers' needs seem to supersede mine( like when I needed the car to get to school, but he wanted to go to the gym, so I had to ride a bike in 90+ heat and be late).

I have no friends left. Often times I'd ask them to do something and be left with excuses or ignored. After a good year of this, I've given up and haven't heard from anyone in months.

My ex-girlfriend used me as a surrogate boyfriend, when we tried to remain friends after breaking up, until she found someone she actually liked, at which point she refused to speak to me again. No reason, no big fight or anything, no goodbye, just silence. I tried to reconnect with her recently, which is when the using was made clear via her best friend, who is an acquaintance of mine.

Finally, people in general just ignore me. Often times people don't even acknowledge when I speak or will talk over me. The other day a woman walking into target ahead of me held the door, so I thanked her, and she gave me a shocked look before saying ""oh, it's actually for that guy."" Not to mention the numerous times I've been called ugly by strangers and children or the guy on the bus who said I look like a rapist or the woman who screamed in terror when I tried to give her a flyer(doing work for my brother that I was never thanked or paid for...).


I guess I just am hoping someone, anyone, can give me a reason not to go through with this. I'm terrified but I am at the end of my rope and nothing else makes sense. I even went for a 5 hour walk in hopes I'd be too tired to go through with it but on coming home, sore and limping, and seeing no one cared that I had left without a word, keys, wallet, or phone, has kinda brought the feelings back."
2n84g9,0,2014-11-23,"""Think Outside the Box"" Real-World Problems with Real-World Rewards",FuSoYa69,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2n84g9/think_outside_the_box_realworld_problems_with/,"This has been making its rounds elsewhere on Reddit but I wanted to alert the folks here.  I recently became aware of a site called [MindSumo](https://www.mindsumo.com/) where you can submit engineering-centric solutions to real-world problems and, possibly, get a cash payout for good ideas. 

You need a .edu email address to sign up.  Typically, rewards for good submissions are $50-$150 with new ""challenges"" submitted continuously.  Once you've accrued $100 you can cash out to Paypal and then as soon as every $25 thereafter.

Get $5 (with promo code: UMICH_SUMO) + $30 bonus added to your account when signing up.  There are also numerous easy ways to get bonuses toward your first $100 payout including completing a profile, writing an article about your experience, submitting your first proposed solution, etc. 

Full disclosure: By using UMICH_SUMO, you get the $5 bonus and I get a $1 referral bonus. 

Proposed solutions can be as complex or simple as you like.  Some might involve simply writing, others some design or sketching, some may even include programming.

Now, some personal thoughts.  

I was a practicing engineer for eight years before returning to school (I'll let you guess where based on the referral code).  In that time, I was faced with a number of challenges that required first-of-a-kind solutions.  I had the good fortune to work with two very experienced engineers who had honed their abilities to derive creative solutions to those problems and who were terrific mentors to me.  I see this website as providing a way for engineering students to practice creative problem solving for real problems, with the added benefit of a potential cash payout.  Depending on the amount of time/work you invest, you also begin building a portfolio of mini-projects when it comes time to discuss ""past work"" during interviews.  Is there the prestige, networking opportunities, or level of experience of an internship.  No.  However, if you show that you're passionate about solving problems and can discuss a novel solution that you developed (regardless of the field), that *will* get the interviewer's attention if they are truly looking for a creative technical worker.

Please don't hesitate to post a comment below if you have a question about MindSumo or, frankly, about what it's like to be an engineer (or about what it's like to be an engineer who returned to school after having worked a while).

**TLDR** Opportunity to practice thinking creatively to solve real problems with potential fiscal reward and low barrier to entry."
2n8jiw,4,2014-11-24,Guilt over wanting to quit undergraduate research position,WiiPu,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2n8jiw/guilt_over_wanting_to_quit_undergraduate_research/,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about research and the possibility of grad school, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My guilt lies in the facts that I:

 1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship.

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore.

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down. Thanks for reading."

The school touts itself as the ""world's honors college"".

I'll be obtaining a B.S. in Computer engineering. Relevant Coursework: Engineering Foundations: Design &amp; Innovation, Engineering Foundations: Digital Logic, Engineering Foundations: Circuit Fundamentals, Engineering Foundations: Simulations &amp; Computational Methods, Engineering Foundations: Instrumentation, Sensors, Actuators; Engineering Materials, Advanced Digital Logic, Computer System Programming, Computer Architecture and Organization, Introduction to Operating Systems, Software Engineering I, Communication Networks, Data Structures and Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Databases, Foundations of Computer Graphics, Introduction to Game Programming, Game Development Studio I, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math.

I'll be taking Embedded Systems and Statistics and Probability for Engineers next year.

As you can see, I've enough math courses for a math minor, and a large amount of courses shared with Computer Science, Game Development, and broad engineering foundations. Not mentioned above, I've also taken Foundations of Science, which covers physics, chemistry, and biology. I've also taken several technology-oriented humanities.

My current GPA is 3.165. Not too stellar... And my GRE scores are 159/164/4.0

Extracurriculars-wise, I'm the treasurer of my school's Student Interest Group focused on Videogames, videogame culture. I've also done volunteer work as part of my school's engineering group, ""Engineers for Social Impact"", and gone to Sri Lanka to help construct buildings for a village.

I have some internship experience as well. I've worked as an intern at the Abu Dhabi office of Gensler, an architecture firm, and I've also worked at NBCUniversal as an Operations and Technical Services intern, commuting from my home in CA to their office in Universal City. Both paid internships. And the summer prior to college, I worked as a volunteer swim coach at my community's children's swim league.

I've published one paper to I2MTC 2014, and am currently doing capstone research in Computer Vision.

I have 3 professors willing to write my letters of recommendation.

How are my chances? I'm REALLY worried about my GPA, and my lack of substantial research material. And what can I capitalize on in my statement of purpose? If more details are needed, feel free to ask!"

I went in to talk to someone about it at the career center at my school and managed to actually find a student who had interned there in the past. Even they expressed that they would not recommend interning for them and to pursue other options. I even found out about a nasty lawsuit they are apparently battling right now.

I am currently looking for software engineering internships for the summer of 2015.

So I just received an email from a company that I really, really, really want to intern at this summer. The recruiter emailed me asking for more information, essentially wanting an unofficial transcript. So, my transcript isn't great (few Cs, one C-). But I felt like if I could just explain why, it would give a better representation of who I am. 

I am currently a student a top 4 CS university who intended to major in political science, but would later switch to CS. It was really hard at times, and the rigor between the two majors was much different and there was a learning curve for me. But, I chose to learn from this adversity and let it push me forward. My grades don’t represent what I got from my courses, or my understanding of the material. I also participate in hackathons and work on personal projects, so I don’t feel like my grades should define me. Do I bother explaining this to the recruiter who emailed me? 

I don’t want to come off as someone who makes excuses for his short comings, because thats just not who I am. But I kind of want to justify this, but don’t know if it is appropriate. 

This is probably the last roadblock before getting an interview. And I want an interview really, really, really badly."

Also does anyone know if the following 3 companies accept Fall interns? I'm considering the possibility of deferring one of the internships for Fall term. I appreciate all your inputs. Thank you!!


**Microsoft - Software Design Engineer Intern, Foundry Program**


Pro: Microsoft hires the most new grad PMs and I'm hoping this will get my foot in the door


Con: The Foundry program is not a typical MS internship. It involves making an application as a team of 5 interns, like a full-time school project but you get paid. I won't get to work in a real industry setting.


**Facebook - Project Manager Intern**


Pro: Mostly the prestige, location (Menlo Park), cool product


Con: The description makes it sound like a secretarial job (documentation, scheduling, etc.) but I can try to ask for more responsibilities once I'm there?


**Salesforce - Program Manager Intern**


Pro: The job description is the most interesting. I will get to work with stakeholders to gather, prioritize, and ship features, which is what I really want to do


Con: Less known to people outside the tech world (I'm Asian and making my parents proud is quite important to me)

2ncu0x,2,2014-11-25,Negotiating compensation with very few aces?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ncu0x/negotiating_compensation_with_very_few_aces/,"A while ago I received an internship offer from a pretty reputable tech company that is not in the Valley. Now, my compensation (in their systems group, effectively doing programming) is absolutely great, but if the numbers that have recently been popping up are to trust, their compensation for an SWE internship is about 50% more.

If I end up accepting the offer as is, I'll be quite happy. But I do feel that I should at least think about a negotiation strategy here, if not to actually try to get a better offer, then for the sake of becoming better at it, since as a college student myself and many readers naturally don't have a whole lot of experience negotiating. Besides, I need money about as much as the next student, and getting the absolute best out of a situation seems like a vital skill in the real world.

So, the facts I'm working with:

1. My previous summer's internship totaled to about the same amount, they took care of housing but paid less - the new company doesn't take care of housing. Is there such a thing as ""Hey, I have 3 months more experience than I did last summer, I deserve a raise!""?

2. My offer is less than say the top 30 SV companies, while the SWE offer is highest in the nation and 50% more than mine (if the number that keeps showing up around the internet is not just based on the same damn Quora answer where it originally showed up)

3. My interviews were effectively SWE interviews, and I will be programming, just in a different context I suppose.

I have until mid-spring to accept, so there is a chance that I'll have a competing offer on my hands by then.

Now, I performed well at my previous internship and could have gone back if I wanted to, but they didn't throw an offer my way without me explicitly stating interest. My recruiter was quite persistent in attempting to get me to come back, but I didn't want to waste her time just to get an offer to use as leverage, as I do want to stay in good terms with the company. I recognize that being a bit more cold blooded here might have helped, but live and learn.

There are two possible paths that I can pursue -

1. Extract more details about my current role and about how it differs from the software engineering role. If the differences are actually big enough to the point where I would really prefer the other role even if there was no pay difference, then I should be able to formulate a good argument for getting a switch, and I'd have a better reason to do so than just a few K over a summer.

2. (I think execution here would have to wait until a competing offer, realistically) Take a shot, slap myself around for a bit, and go tell a company that receives thousands of applications that I want more money just because a person of roughly equivalent experience is making much more than me. At a glance this seems ridiculous, but I wouldn't be surprised if some industry veteran had some comments on pulling this off. It's unlikely that I possess the cojones to do so, though.

Comments and personal experiences are greatly appreciated. And as I already expressed, I'm quite happy with the offer, but the reality is that no company will ever negotiate on my behalf. Hopefully this will be beneficial to others in a similar situation."

I had zero work experience or internships. I was really worried about it. Most people i asked told me to stay in school an extra semester to pull it up.

If your in the same position know that if you study , get a good personal project and apply to at least 10 jobs a week you will find work. If anybody has any questions i would be happy to answer them.

Edit: I loved hearing about all the others who had a lower GPA and still made it in this field. It was really disheartening every time being turned down for my GPA being too low. I even considered lying a couple times.

Edit2:Thats why I wanted to make this thread so others wouldn't just give up and work outside their field. Or feel like they wasted 4 years. GPA is not everything, you just have to do a little more leg work to find that first job. "
2ndf58,295,2014-11-25,For Which Crispy Pulls Double Duty...,MisterCrispy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ndf58/for_which_crispy_pulls_double_duty/,"[Insert Obligatory long time listener, first time caller line here.] I worked at a small TPA (Third Party Administrator) a while back which handled enrollment services and billing for small insurance companies and agencies. Believe me, what the company description lacked in excitement, the people who worked there and ran the company made up for it 10 fold. Some of the strangest people I've ever worked for by far. This is one of my stories. I'll post more if you like this one.

When I first started at this company, we had a network admin. I was initially just a web developer. After about a year, the net admin quit rather abruptly. Upper management (all two of them) was panicking because they didn’t have anyone they could get in right away (they hated dealing with headhunters and preferred direct hire). I had worked in networking before I made the switch to developer so I mentioned I could take care of that in the meantime until they find someone. There is a thin line between bravery and stupidity. At the time, I thought I was “stepping up to the plate” as the phrase goes. In hindsight….not so much. I was really setting myself up for a headache that lasted my entire time there. 

The bright side was that we weren’t a four-9’s shop. There were only 2 times of the day we really truly had to be working as far as upper management was concerned: when we ran billing. We only “guaranteed” uptime during our business hours adjusted for west coast time because one of our clients was in LA. Even then, the guarantee was rather loose as well. Not so much a “guarantee” as it was “we’ll do our best”. It gave us a lot of wiggle room which was good because….our network. My god I still have nightmares about that thing. Still, 99% of the company’s income was made in those two billing time blocks. They were important. (Look, 4th grade teacher, I DO understand foreshadowing!)

The company was always on a shoestring budget. The margins were small and BigBoss preferred to share the profits with the employees (after taking his piece, mind you) rather than investing more in the infrastructure. It’s great if you’re an employee, bad if you are responsible for said infrastructure. What resulted was a hodge podge of used and clearance purchased servers combined with hardware that wasn’t really ready for the big leagues. There were refurbished Compaq DL380s sitting next to a re-purposed HP desktop with an EMachine thrown in for good measure (among other things), you get the picture. I know many are cringing but, as a testament to the former net admin, she made this stuff work and it worked amazingly well for what we asked of it.

So I took over the maintenance of this quagmire of pain. Like I said, the previous person did a phenomenal job setting it up so I didn’t have to do much beyond staying late every now and then to run update and make sure the backups went properly. On its own, it would be a cushy job. Combined with the fact that I was also working mid level web developer and had to stop and go fix people’s desktops constantly or mess with the servers, it was a pain. I did such a good job standing on the necks of giants, however, that BigBoss decided they didn’t need to hire anyone. 

Joy.

So our customer base was growing. I was doing more and more work and having to bounce between the servers and programming was becoming more and more difficult. I finally had enough. I told BigBoss that I either needed some help or he needed to pick one role for me. He said that I was doing such a good job that he’d had to lose me in either position so they were going to look for some help for me. At least someone that could handle the desktop support or, if nothing else, someone I could boss around when dealing with the server stuff. Either one was fine with me….at least so I thought. BigBoss was creative. Like I said, shoestring budget. His solution was to contact the local college and see if any of their computer science majors needed some internships.

Joy.

So I went from having to babysit a network to having to babysit a college kid with zero experience and even less knowledge. Seriously, junior level compsci students should at least know basic troubleshooting by that point, right? I’m guessing there was either a major issue with school quality or the smart kids knew not to take a vaguely defined internship position with a small time software company.

The only arguably qualified person to respond was a kid I will henceforth refer to as “Snotnose”. He wasn’t a brat or anything. He had bad allergies and no sense of hygiene. We learned quickly not to shake hands with him. He knew a bit about troubleshooting having had to keep his family’s computers running. Beyond that, he had a bit to learn and, sadly, it was up to me to teach him enough to be useful. Fast forward a bit. It took a while but Snotnose was finally understanding the basics. He had learned which computers did what, how to run the backups, how to troubleshoot desktops, and to ignore any requests from Madame Wrecks-a-lot (more about her in another story). I felt comfortable giving some slack to his leash. People were now allowed to go to him directly for a certain set of issues and he was under strict instructions to clear it by me if any request were outside of those specific issues. He was happy. I was happy. The world was getting a bit brighter.

Then one day I went to lunch.

I get a frantic call during my lunch break from BigBoss (who was on his lunch break) saying “The sites are down! Customers are calling! Find out what’s happening!”. This was before wi-fi and tethering and such were common so my only choice was to get a doggy bag, pay, then break a few speed limits on my way back to the office. 

I find Snotnose in the conference room with all the servers sitting on the conference table with their cases open and him digging around inside. He must have noticed the slight confusion and urgency in my voice when I politely asked him “WHAT IN THE BLUE F!@#$!@@ DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING!?” 

Turns out BigBoss had gotten a sweet deal on some more memory for the servers. He dropped them off on Snotnose’s desk and told him that it was for the servers then BigBoss went to lunch with some clients. This is when I learn that guidelines are only good if they are VERY specific. You see, memory upgrades were allowed...on desktops. I assumed that it was assumed so I didn’t specify it in the list specifically. My god that hurt to type. Anyway, the BigBoss assumed Snotnose would give me the memory and let me know. Snotnose said “oh! Memory! I can do that” then proceeded to try and upgrade the servers….not knowing exactly which server the memory was for. Rather than bring one down and check, he shut down all of them and opened them up to compare.

So to recap, Snotnose brought down the entire network...at once...during one of our two peak traffic times of the day (lunch time and 11:00pm was when various processes ran that moved data around so customers could run certain reports and billing and such). These were the most important times for the network to be up because it meant money coming into the company. It delayed funding. It was a cluster-f.

As I sat there listening to Snotnose explain between sneezes and snorts, I remember thinking this wasn’t helping my inevitable stomach ulcer. As I started to put stuff back together, Snotnose seemed to feel this was the perfect time to try to get me to explain server internals and such. I knew he was just a kid but the downtime was a big problem and his questions weren't helping. Yelling wasn’t going to fix anything at this point. My priority had to be getting the network back up and in the proper order. My anger was rising to the point that my calm.....ish demeanor wasn't going to last.

&gt;Me: Snotnose, go stand with your nose in the corner.

&gt;SN: *laughs*

&gt;Me: Do you see me laughing, wench?

&gt;SN: But I…

&gt;Me: NOSE! CORNER!

He shuffled off and stood in the corner. I got everything back together quickly and get the network back up and running in record time. I think the servers themselves knew how angry I was because they booted up faster than normal considering the new memory wasn’t actually installed yet. 

I went back in my office to test everything out and to send out an email letting the customers know the site was back up along with some BS explanation of why it went down so as not accept blame as a company and not to throw anyone under the bus (regardless of how much they deserved it).

A few hours later, the BigBoss, back from his lunch meeting/golf outing stops by my office.

&gt;BB: Thanks for getting the site back up. What happened?

&gt;Me: Long story.

&gt;BB: Why is Snotnose standing in the corner of the conference room?

&gt;Me: Self-preservation.

2ne9ad,3,2014-11-25,"CIS undergrad, thinking about switching to a CS bachelor/adding CS master",snap_cn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ne9ad/cis_undergrad_thinking_about_switching_to_a_cs/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

I have some questions regarding my major. I studied Business administration for two semesters and got into programming at my second semester, really enjoyed it and eventually wanted to switch to a tech related major. I eventually switched to CIS because I could keep all the grades from my two semesters, for which I've worked really hard for. Unfortunatly, I've made the mistake to research the translation ""business informatics"" of the German name ""Wirtschaftsinformatik"" instead of ""CIS"", so I didn't get to read all (negative) opinions the about this major regarding career prospects before making the switch. Now I'm worried that I won't get as good career options as with a CS major for software dev positions  even if'd have a good portfolio of personal projects and work experience from internships. 

Because CIS majors are quite different across schools and countries: In my CIS major, I attend programming classes with the CS majors and will have the option to attend advanced CS classes (e.g. Intro to Artifical Intelligence), so my CIS major isn't all about IT.

If a CIS major is a massive disadvantage if I want to get a software dev position, I have these options:

* I could switch to a CS major next year and probably could finish it with no delays, if I'd take extra classes along my CIS major. (Which I currently do)

* I could attend master courses in the last few semesters of my Bachelor (because I already have finished the courses of 2 semesters), and then add a master in CS after my CIS bachelor. I guess a master should only be necessary if I want to work in a really specialised field like Robotics, Quantitive Finance etc. (?)

My questions are: 

1. Is my CIS major a massive disadvantage if I want to go for a software dev position ?. I'm working on a personal project right now and I'm planning to have a good portfolio ready before I graduate

2. If my CIS major is disadvantage and I should switch: Should I switch to a CS bachelor or keep my CIS bachelor and add a (shorter) master in CS?

It would be great to hear your opinions about this situation. Thanks for your help."

2nejxy,8,2014-11-25,Dropped out of college due to financial troubles and death in family. Now I'm trying to find something to keep me afloat.,MadameDefarge91,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2nejxy/dropped_out_of_college_due_to_financial_troubles/,"About 6 months ago due to the financial cost being too much for me, even with financial aid and I also had a death in the family that just made it unbearable for me to be apart from my family in Los Angeles.
I had a year and a half left to complete to acquire my Bachelor's in History and Minor in Education.  

Prior to leaving school I worked as a Lead Tutor for an elementary school through a program provided by my university. I was hoping that having experience as a Tutor (i've worked with the program for 2 years) would help when it came to getting my teaching credential for history. I was undecided whether i wanted to be a middle school or high school teacher.

Now that I am back home I want to find something that I could do that will look great on my resume and especially when i go back to school to finish with my major. I don't know how long it will be till I go back but it probably won't be anytime soon. 

I would love to have some guidance. My family and friends have done an amazing job helping me cope with my aunt's death and getting me back on my feet but now I want to be able to do something and start building my life back with school not being an option right now.

*The following are skills and passions are things I absolutely love doing.* 

* Reading, writing, learning, or teaching **HISTORY**. 
* I love writing. I am in the processes of writing a couple of shorts stories and I also am working on a script for a television show pilot that I would love to turn in eventually.
* When I was younger i play guitar and now I still do whenever I have the chance. I wanted to go to MI (Musicians Institute) when I was in high school but thought about getting an actual education as a substitute. I would love doing something in music if it was available to me. 

If anyone has any advice or has been in the same position as me I am begging for help here. I don't want to continue working at places like Starbucks or any sort of job that where people are going to constantly nag and bitch at you for not getting their order right. Not that there's anything wrong with people who have these jobs but I'm just trying to push myself to something that I know i could do better and that I would love doing.

I am also open to potential internships that could lead me to acquiring something in my fields. 

Thanks to all of you and this subreddit. I've read a lot of redditor's struggles on here and I am happy to see that this is a great and helpful community for people who need a hand."

I worked all summer 50+ hours a week and ended up making close to 30k income for the summer, with about 14k in savings.

I'm at a crossroads now, I really want to move out west for the winter I haven't really been happy where I am now and feel like I need to get out and experience a new place, and some adventure as I've never done anything like this. I have the money to support myself for 6+ months, and guaranteed employment if I come back home for the summer, but not in the technology/computer field.

Today I got an email for a job interview in 2 weeks for an IT Support position, and I was hoping to leave before that. I'm feel like pretty much guaranteed the position as I know people in the management, and the specifically told me to apply, and that they would help me with the job.

I don't really want to ask my parents, because I know they will tell me to stay home and interview and work in IT. I'm in a tough spot because I never did any internships during college, and it has come up in almost every previous job interview I've had and I feel like that's a big hindrance on my eligibility for positions. I have a decent track record for landing interviews, for the 8 positions I've applied for I've had 4 interviews.

At the same time I feel like I'm at a point in my life, where if I take a job I'll be stuck in the 9-5 grind, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that. I really want to get out and experience things, and get away from where I grew up since I've never been away for more than a week or two at a time.

Ideally I'm hoping to head to Bend, OR. And I know the job market is tough there, but I'm hoping to spend most my time at the mountain. I'd like to find some sort of part time internship or software position, but I don't know what my odds really are. It seems theres more jobs there than where I currently live, but I know no one that lives there and at the same time, I only have a few friends where I live now as everyone moved away after school. I am putting myself out on a limb, hoping to find some fun and the way I look at it, now is the time do it.

I have about two semesters left, so at this point I already finished the Java series (3 courses) and my C++ series (1 course: C++ for Java programmers).


But when do you truly ""know"" the language?


I mean, for C++: I know of many differences it has from Java, I know how to manage memory on the heap, and I know about OOP principles in general. Is this good enough to say that I know C++?


I'm assuming since I've completed both Java and C++ series at my university, that I can assume that I know just enough to get me into an internship, but not really everything about the languages."
2ngk40,0,2014-11-26,CS61A or 61B First?,gobearsgobears,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2ngk40/cs61a_or_61b_first/,"I know that in general, it's recommended to take CS61A before 61B. However my case is different since I decided to switch to CS very recently. As a Sophomore who JUST made the switch and starting from scratch basically for the CS major, I need to make an informed decision of whether to take 61A or 61B next semester during the spring.

Normally I intended to take 61A first, but my friend who is a declared CS major told me that taking 61B during the summer is not a good idea. He told me that it's the most important class for acquiring internships and such, and thinks that rushing through 61B during the summer will put me at a disadvantage. I'm going to be applying for internships during the Fall of 2015, so I MUST get 61B and 1A finished before then.

He told me to take it during the semester to learn the material more thoroughly. I can just take 61B next semester, and then take 61A during the summer. However I'm concerned about whether taking 61B before 61A is a bad idea. Will I be okay? Another friend who took 61B before 1A said that he was fine. I don't have prior programming experience, but I'm going to do my best to self-study before this semester ends. In terms of professors, both the professors for 61A (DeNero) and 61B (Hug) are very good. I'm actually torn since I heard that DeNero is awesome, and I would love to take 61A with him.

So to distill my question down to a sentence: would taking 61B in the summer as opposed to the semester hurt me in terms of acquiring internships, and will I be at a disadvantage for taking 61B before 61A?

1) Should I keep any hope for an interview, or start applying to smaller, local companies?


2) I got turned down for one particular job at Intel, but haven't heard back from the other openings yet. Is it still possible for Intel to contact me for the other jobs, or are they uninterested in general?

I have about one year left at my university before I graduate with a bachelors in COSC. Problem is I have no real world experience, and there is no way in hell i'm getting an internship. There is literally no reason for a company to pick me up over someone from one of the bigger city colleges in my state with a stronger curriculum(pretty much every other college). ""Yada yada you'll never know if you dont try."" I am trying. The only thing I'll have under my belt when I graduate is a degee, a personal project or two, and a passion for programming. Passion doesn't pay the bills. So what is a good strategy for when the inevitable happens and no one wants to hire me? Sorry if this is pessimistic but seeing the experience everyone else has on this sub and other subs makes me feel pretty lackluster. I hope this helps someone else in my shoes. "
2nhq7i,9,2014-11-26,Am I screwed if I am bad at coding questions and want a software dev job?,fpo98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nhq7i/am_i_screwed_if_i_am_bad_at_coding_questions_and/,"I am studying Computer Science and I will be graduating in May and I applied to a few jobs earlier past semester and I got rejected from all of them (couldn't even get past first rounds). I am not sure why but it's probably because my coding questions/answers weren't the best. I have a lot of personal issues / ultimatums going on as well so I sort of just gave up getting a job in general which is probably bad but my life is sort of complicated, I digress.


Anyways, I am just not good at answering the typical coding questions on the spot unless I have done the exact problem beforehand and can solve it from memorization. I just do not think really well under pressure and I could probably be able to solve it under different circumstances albeit still not as fast or as good as others. It is not as though I do not study for this since I have spent countless hours studying for them using one of the coding interview books but it won't help me unless I actually memorize the solutions and get the exact problem or incredibly similar. I know some will likely suggest just interviewing more for practice but I don't think that is practical since I only have one semester left and I also think the problem goes deeper than that and probably won't be ""fixable"" in such a short time span (social anxiety).

I mean, I actually don't think that I would be a bad developer since I actually really enjoy learning things and I can dedicate myself to learning things really quickly. Although I also feel that I probably don't have as much experience with respect to classes, projects, languages learned, internships (my only internship was an unrelated IT internship) compared to many of my peers which again puts me at a disadvantage but I still think that I would be a coder since in the very few group projects that I have worked on, I typically see myself as one of the better coders (granted sample size = 1). The really only thing that I have is a really high GPA (3.98).


This has gotten really long and I don't really know where it's going but I think my point is that I feel like it would be too difficult to get a job and since most companies start off with coding questions, which I am not too great at, I am put at a large disadvantage. This coupled with my other problems in life makes me just not want to even apply for jobs and just give up since the process is so stressful and rejections make me feel like absolute shit.

2nhrtx,0,2014-11-26,Looks like I won't get an internship this summer as a sophomore,gwkuser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nhrtx/looks_like_i_wont_get_an_internship_this_summer/,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to first say thank you for clicking on this. I know I am of no value as a student and here I am just shamelessly asking for free consulting (If there's any way I can help you guys out too, let me know!). 

To start things off, I am an ECE major at a top university where top companies recruit at. My **resume to interview conversion rate has been high**, but none of these interviews landed me a single internship. That probably means my skills in solving problems is underdeveloped and I am effectively useless at the moment and/or I just don't fit into the culture of frisbee and free swag and my interviewer can detect that (I'd say with my attitude and personality and interest in finance as a hobby, I'd fit in more with financial services firms). It appears that internship decisions have already been made by a few posts on Facebook saying sophomores got internships at Google. The ideal situation is this:

Get an internship at a smaller company this year

Get an internship at a top company the following year

Graduate in the winter (Gotta love those AP credits) and profit and bro down

Now I really want to stay positive despite the rejections that have taken a great piece of the pie of my soul (If it even exists). Fortunately, I currently have a research job, so I am thinking that I can extend this over the summer. **The question then becomes, should I take summer classes while working in research part time or work in research full time without any classes?** I would have to still attend senior year fall semester due to this capstone design requirement so unfortunately I can't graduate earlier than that. What taking summer classes will allow me to do is take more courses that perhaps relate more with my **dream job at a quantitative hedge fund**. So should I sacrifice some time in research to take summer classes? If you have other suggestions, I am absolutely open to them as well so list them out!

I hope this wasn't too long and sorry if it was. Thanks so much."
2nhxw4,3,2014-11-26,Advice on choosing a co-op/internship next summer,Shape_Shiftr,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2nhxw4/advice_on_choosing_a_coopinternship_next_summer/,"A little background: I switched into Computer Engineering my Junior year. I'm currently classified as a Senior taking what would be my third semester in the CprE program, with a planned five semesters left to go. When I graduate I'll have taken 12 semesters (woo?)




Earlier this year I interviewed with three companies. Two of them were for internships next summer, and one was for a co-op.




I accepted an internship with one of the companies a few weeks ago (If I were to rank this internship with the other two, I'd probably find the other two more interesting). They do say that I have the ability to terminate the internship at any time #burningbridges




However, just last week, the company with the co-op calls and offers a position for next summer and fall. Two things that concern me are: Why did they wait 7 weeks to get back? Also the fact that I'll be delaying my graduation another semester is kinda... meh? Not a big deal  I guess. They want to hear from me ASAP if I'll take the position (no pressure apparently).




Finally, the company that I am most interested in has yet to get back to me; their website still says I am in ""interviewing"" status, as of September 25 (you can tell how prompt they are). If they were to call I'd definitely be interested in going there next summer. 


So r/EngineeringStudents, any advice or suggestions here? 




* Any input or advice on taking a co-op as opposed to an internship? It'd be right after my fourth semester in CprE.




* Is the fact that companies are taking 7-8 weeks to get back to me a red flag? The first company responded back in about a week and half. 




* If the last company does end up calling back with an offer, should I just decline everything and go with them?




I hope I wasn't too vague is describing my position; I want to hear ideas from other people who have possibly been in similar situations. "

2ni7vg,43,2014-11-26,"What’s the truth about ISRO, India’s primary space agency?",crypt221b,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ni7vg/whats_the_truth_about_isro_indias_primary_space/,"What’s the truth about ISRO, India’s primary space agency?

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I can remember, there weren’t many Indian things I thought highly of. ISRO was a rare exception. Capable of developing and deploying geostationary satellites and cryogenic rocket engines, launching lunar probes which would later go on to confirm presence of water on the moon, and now recently, a spacecraft orbiting Mars. For a country that has one of the biggest slum area, gaining a spot in the top 5 space agencies in the world is a pretty remarkable feat. ISRO made India proud among the world’s intellectual circles.

I always wanted to be a part of ISRO. These scientists and engineers had my utmost respect. You can only imagine how religiously I look up to my Dad who actually worked there! No, he wasn’t a scientist or an engineer. He was a Senior Networks and System Admin, basically in charge of all the computers. But that didn’t alter my regards for him in any way. He was loving, supportive, geeky, and the smartest guy I knew. He was my hero. 

Then I turned 18. The charm wore off. I started noticing weird oddities about ISRO. You know how you have these internal flags that can tell when something’s offbeat. You can’t really explain why since these flags are built from your life experiences and act on instinct. Some of these flags were waving bright red for ISRO. No matter how cool my Dad was, you could ignore these oddities only so many times until you realized that something was fishy about the organization. It was enough to make me give up my seat at IIST and go to US for a computer science degree.

&amp;nbsp;

5th November, 2013.

ISRO had launched and placed the MOM satellite in Earth’s orbit. It was night time. I was in my dorm room with my roommate, Tyler. He was an Arts student and we really got along well. He was busy working on his manga comic, taking up the entire bloody floor but I didn’t mind because he drew the hottest chicks imaginable. I was just getting started on a coding assignment, when got a call from Dad. *Oh snap, I forgot*. I picked up the phone and said, “Hey Dad, congrats! Sorry, I missed the live covera-“. I was cut off mid-sentence. My sister was on the other end, crying uncontrollably. 

After a moment, she gathered herself and said, “Come home, Raj. Dad passed away of a heart attack.” The world around me stopped still, as I tried to grasp the gravity of what she had just said. For a second, I couldn’t speak. 

Swallowing a heavy lump in my throat, I said, “No, what are you saying?! How did this happen!?” 

She said, “I got a call from Dad’s friend saying he just collapsed in his cabin. By the time help arrived, it was all too late.” 

Her words cut deeper than any blade. Tyler looked up at me making an expression as if asking what’s wrong. Trying hard not to break my voice, I said, “Look, don’t worry at all okay? Just take care of Mommy. I’ll be there by tomorrow.” By the time I was looking at international flights rates, I was in tears.

The funeral was attended by all my relatives, family friends, neighbours and a few of Dad’s colleagues from System’s. Though nobody from the core senior team of ISRO came. Cold bastards. From that day on, I loathed ISRO. 

&amp;nbsp;

24th September, 2014.

“So, you’re saying it’s impossible for me to touch anything?” she asked. I was sitting in the college cafeteria, having lunch with Amy, a girl I was dating. She was a Foreign Student Exchange Program student from Dublin and was here for only a semester. An introverted girl which is reason why I liked her. I liked how she wouldn’t start taking selfies at random places. I liked how she preferred parks over restaurants. How she didn’t watch dubbed anime because it was apparently disrespectful towards their original voices. She was smart, funny, artistic and emotionally mature. Also, I figured dating her and having my heart broken after 6 months would be a great way to get over my previous emotional setback.

“Yep, that’s right,” I said. “Electrons are on the outermost shell and they repel each other. So you never really touch anything. What you feel is just… repulsion.”

“Oh…” she said. “Does that mean I’m still a virgin?”

I almost fell off the chair. *Well, so much for introvertism.* “Funny,” I muttered. 

Then, I heard the word “ISRO”. Normally, the ears filters out random noise but certain trigger words when heard, really put you on alert. The TV was playing a piece about how the Orbiter had successfully entered Mar’s orbit. India was the first Asian country to accomplish this feat. I cringed. 

Amy sighed. She said, “You know you need to stop making faces and be proud for once. They did a really great job!”

I said “I don’t have a problem with their job. I have a problem with them.” 

That night, a message alert distracted me. I was lying in bed, busy texting with Amy, doing all the cheesy things one does while in a relationship.

&gt; **Me**: UUUGGGHHH. I think Prof. White mailed us a new assignment. :-(

&gt; **Amy**: Again? This is the 3rd one this weekend! He needs leave you poor kids alone.

&gt; **Me**: I know! It sucks! I better get started with it. Meanwhile, you write him a letter explaining our dire state.

&gt; **Amy**: Haha, sure. Get started now. Goodnight. &lt;3

&gt; **Me**: Goodnight. &lt;3

*Okay, cheesy convo over. Let’s get our hands dirty. *

Tyler said, “You know I’ve seen a lot of couples that do weird stuff but that you two take the cake.” 

“I know,” I said. “That’s why I like her.” 

“No you don’t understand, I’m her classmate. And I barely see her in class. She just hangs out with you all day.”

I smirked and said, “Don’t get me wrong but do I detect a hint of jealousy here?”

“Oh go fuck yourself already. I’m the one who introduced you to her,” he said. “Anyway, I know you want to experience a heartbreak and all, but don’t go overboard. I don’t want to be the one driving you around town for therapy.”

“Yes Tyler, I promise I won’t go psychotic.” I said.

He chuckled. “That’s what they all say.”

I gave him a dismissive look and I opened the mail to see that it wasn’t from Prof. White or any other professor. No, this mail was from an unknown sender. *Spam? Are you kidding me? * I opened it anyway, because I enjoy reading spam mails. They’re always so desperate, I find it rude to simply delete it. Also, their English is incredibly funny. Little did I know what the devil waited for me inside.



&gt; From: neoXXXX@gmail.com

&gt; Subject: Read this now. Urgent. Not spam.

&gt; Are you Raj Singh from Bangalore, India? If so, please reply. We need to talk.

*Interactive spam huh? Well this is new.* I wondered which website decided to sell out my private information. I replied:

&gt; Yes, Neo. I am the one that you seek.

I eagerly wait for a reply but instead of an email, I get a chat message. *You sneaky bastard!* He added me in hangouts chat. This is spamming on a whole new level!

&gt; **Neo**: Look, I need to tell you something very important. Your Dad didn’t simply die, he was murdered.

The smile on my face vanished faster than the speed of light. For a second, I almost fell for it.

&gt; **Me**: Okay who the fuck is this? You think it’s funny? Stop messing around, pal.

&gt; **Neo**: Raj, I am not kidding around. There’s something seriously wrong with ISRO. Now, I’ve always had a fair share of doubt but what happened yesterday definitely hammered the last nail in the coffin.

I decided to play along. I shouldn’t have. But for some reason, he seemed to know what he was talking about.

&gt; **Me**: Okay you have my attention. Speak.

&gt; **Neo**: I’m going to voice call you. Make sure you are alone.

&gt; **Me**: Wait, give me 5 minutes.

I took my laptop and told Tyler I’ll be gone for a while. He smirked and said, “Yeah, just make sure you kids use protection.”

I went to the terrace of my building. It was the only lonely place within close proximity.

I sat near the terrace door and started the voice call. “Okay, speak.”

Neo said, “Thank you for hearing me out since I know it can be hard for you to trust. You see, I started as an intern in System’s back when your father was in charge. I rose to Junior System Admin’s role and was satisfied with the way things were. But what happened yesterday, changed everything. While fixing a computer’s LAN connection in a core lab, I overheard a conversation between two scientists who were walking by. I was under the computer table, sitting patiently for the central server to restart. I’m pretty sure they didn’t notice me there because this is the conversation that followed.”

He pasted a conversation in the chat box. It read:

 “Can you believe we pulled off the Mars mission?”

“I know. So crazy! And I thought that scumbag Systems guy sabotaged everything. With all the data he acquired, he would have destroyed everything we’ve been working on.”

“Don’t speak about him, you moron. He’s been dealt with. Just focus on what’s next.”

“Right, right.”

Chills ran up my spine as every strand of hair in my body stood straight. The cold breeze of the night didn’t help. My voice quivered as I said, “I don’t get it. Why would ISRO scientists murdered my Dad?”

Neo said, “This came as an absolute shock to me to me as well. When I thought about it, the answer was clear. Money. These bastards had manipulated the budget and somehow your father picked up on this. And we all know the audits are pretty much a joke so they were never going to get caught. From what I think, your Dad started collecting evidence to put them behind bars.”

I said, “So you’re saying Dad stole their private data? This makes no sense. Even if you have access to it, the data would encrypted. There’s no way to decrypt it without a key.”

“Yes, you’re right. But if you have physical access to a computer, you can pretty much always get in. There’s all sorts of ways like spywares and keyloggers. Your Dad had the motives and the skills to do it.”

*Fair enough.* I hate to admit it but the guy seemed legit. He knew way too much about ISRO. I had little reason to suspect him. I said, “Okay. So, what do you propose we do?”

“Honestly speaking,” Neo sighed and said, “I don’t really know. Whatever we do, proving it in a court would be next to impossible without any evidence. I didn’t know your father all that well, but from what I can recall, he was a great guy. I just wanted to tell you the truth about your father’s death. I know it’s a long shot, but if you can think of any place where your Dad could have hid the data, it might give you a lead. Maybe a pen-drive or a remote FTP or something like that. I doubt he’d store it on his laptop because it’s too vulnerable and obvious. But yeah… that’s about your only option. You can contact me if you get something, I’ll be checking this email weekly. If something solid turns up, we can go public. Okay? You still there? Hello…” 

My brain was already mining out a memory from its neural chaos. A memory that I had forgotten I once had. It’s funny how your brain works. Your subconscious stores all sorts of memories and keeps it buried deep inside only to be revealed at the perfect opportunity.

I managed to hide the thrill in my voice and said, “Yes, I’m here.”

I thanked him for coming out of the blue and helping me the way he did. We said goodbye and ended the call.

I immediately called my sister and told her to mail me a picture of the poster in our parent’s bedroom as soon as possible. She knew better than to ask why and did it.

I returned to my room. Tyler wasn’t there, probably had gone to spend the night out with his friends. I eagerly waited for my sister’s email, hoping my hunch was right.

Around two years ago, me and my friend were in my parent’s bedroom, finding my Dad’s temperature gun. He gave up and sat on the bed, admiring the huge poster that hung right across the bed. 

“There it is!” I yelled. “Let’s see whose laptop runs cooler now.”

He laughed and said, “You know whoever made this poster is a moron.”

I asked, “Oh, really? Why is that?”

“Well, look at the name of their website.”

The link was written in tiny font, vertically across. I had honestly never cared to read it. I sighed and said, “That’s not a link to their website, smartass. Though, they really are morons. Anyway, let’s go check out the laptops already.”

It’s funny how I recalled that incident, after all these years. The e-mail came in. I opened the attachment and voila! The answer to where Dad hid all the data was staring me right in the face. *The link*. 

I quickly typed the link in the address bar and hit “Enter”. It took me to a Google document that had multiple links, each link redirecting to an anonymous free host, which presumably contained the actual data. It was exactly what I imagined. The link was a bitly link. For those of you who don’t know, a bitly link is a URL shortening service. It’s easy to spot them if you know what you are looking for. They shorten your link into random numbers which is easier to share. Dad used this exploit ingeniously. First, he stored the actual data on multiple anonymous free hosts, whose links were then pasted on a simple Google document made with an anonymous account. That Google document was then converted into a short URL. This meant he didn’t have to depend on a paid hosting. It didn’t leave a digital footprint that could trace it back to him. Heck, he didn’t even need a pen drive, all he needed was that shortened URL. It contained links to all the free hosts. There were probably 2 pages worth of links. That probably amounted to hundreds of gigabytes of data.

However, there was a catch. All those links were password-protected. It was difficult to get around that. Not impossible though.

I thought about it and decided tell Neo. In retrospect, that was the biggest mistake of my life.

&gt; **Me**: Hey, still online? I think I got something.

After 7 minutes, his reply came in.

&gt; **Neo**: Are you serious?

&gt; **Me**: Yes. Hang on, let me I’ll call you.


He took a while to pick up. When he finally did, he blurted out, “What on earth did you find? And that too so quickly?”

I noticed his voice sounded completely different than before. *A voice changer.* He was certainly taking every measure to hide his identity. I said, “Don’t ask me how but I found a bitly link. You know the ones they use to shorten URL? I just really hoped it would reveal something important. Well, guess what? I have the list of all the web hosts Dad used to store his data.”

He said, “No way! I cannot believe you figured it out so fast. This is incredible. Can I see the link please?”

I said, “Yes, of course. I typed it in the chat box. I know it’s a big lead, but the thing is, the data on those servers is still password-protected. So, what I am thinking is, we should probably go to the authorities at this point. Then, get them to mail those web hosts to release the data for investigation. Because most of the time, these free hosting services are always willing to co-operate if they feel we have some ground. What do you say?” 

There was a long pause followed by a strange beep. 


“Oh Raj, you shouldn’t have,” she said. It was unmistakable. That was Amy’s voice on the other end. Then before disconnecting the call, she said, “These things… they make us do horrible things. I’m sorry you got dragged into this. Goodbye.” 

The voice call ended and my world split into two. It took a while for reality sink in. *No! Why would she, of all people? * I tried calling her cellphone but she didn’t pick up. I freaked out like a mad dog. I ran up to her hostel, in the middle of the night, only to find that it was locked. *No, this cannot be happening.* I know I once told I wanted a heartbreak, but this was overkill by a long shot. Unable to take it anymore, I passed out on the hostel corridor.

Two strange things happened after that day. All the free webhosts links stopped working and I never saw Amy again. I asked around and found out she had to leave due to her “medical operation” and wasn’t going to return for the remaining semester. She was gone for good. Her phone number gave a dead tone. Her so-called “friends”, were good acquaintances at best, who didn’t even know she was an Exchange Program student.

I am lost and depressed and scared. I don’t know what my next move should be. I don’t want to go legal without a strong case because it can ultimately backfire and shatter my already devastated life. I am beginning to think that was all just a nightmare. Maybe Tyler was right. I had become psychotic.

There were/are awesome, their main purpose is to help students get real world experience. Profits from projects from full time employees are invested back into the program to give more students internships and jobs.
* Graduated, got offered to come on full-time by the non-profit. I became a on-site contractor for my state government doing data visualization websites and general programming tasks. The non-profit offered me this as a stepping stone to get into the industry, I took the job despite the pay because I knew that long term it would be good. The expectation among my bosses was that I'd do this for a year or two and then move onto better jobs with the contacts I make from this job. They have said in the past that they would like me to stay for at least one year.
 * Salary - $40k/year, no benefits for the 1st year, mid-Atlantic region, my area's lower 10th percentile for salary is $63k and the average is $78k
* Work is great, I love my coworkers and I love the work I do. My portfolio is getting awesome and I'm meeting a ton of people. Culture is that of a government office though.

I started my post-college position in early June, 2014. Jump to a couple days ago.

* Make a contact at a company that does a lot of contract work for the state. It's a well established 120ish employee SaaS start-up that is the leader in their industry; when I started working at this job, I always had it in the back of my mind that I'd like to apply here when I wanted to switch jobs. I use their product daily, so I know it well. They have a division within their company that literally does exactly what I do.
* She passes my information onto their senior architect.
* He looked at some of my projects and he sets up a phone call with me, they really really want me to apply because my skills overlap pretty much exactly with what they want.

I really want this job too, but I don't want to leave my current employer after 6 months. They've been awesome and they're expecting a year out of me. I also love my current job, I wouldn't be leaving because I'm unhappy at my current job with the exception of that they're paying me ridiculously low and they won't budge. I'm probably looking at a 100% increase in salary at least, which is a big deal between student loans and an upcoming wedding. I initially said on the phone that I'd like to stay at my current employer for a year but he said he was going to keep trying to get me to apply and I'm thinking about taking him up on the offer. I don't want to stay at my current job for pure obligation when it's against my best interests, but then again, I'm not quite sure what my best interests are in this scenario or if I need to stay for non-obligation reasons like I don't want to burn a bridge.

Any advice? Thanks."

Academically, I'm in a pretty good position (good program, 4.0 GPA, various awards, possibly an independent publication, etc.), but I'm not sure how keen I am on taking the academic route. The seemingly endless hoard of prospective biomedicine postdocs also keeps the wage at an absurdly low level (average is $42 000 a year). I do a lot of computational work in neuroscience (data analysis, visualization, computational modeling), and so while I might not be doing exactly the same type of stuff as data scientists generally do, it is very similar in many ways. My question is what is the best way of breaking into the field with the particular background that I have? On paper, I am encouraged by my school to do an internship during my PhD in an unrelated area of research so I've been thinking about doing that. My worry is that I will spend those months just doing mundane tasks instead of learning to use the tools and techniques commonly used in the field. Ideally, I would like to take those months to get more familiar with databases, machine learning, and in general working with data that comes in lots of different formats.    
    
Given that piece of information, would anyone have any clue what my best bet would be? Is an internship likely to be beneficial for me or should I just graduate and look for data science jobs? What about boot camps?

I am a bit over seven months into my job as a new hire at Amagoobooksoft. I interned here and – despite being unimpressed with my colleagues during the summer – joined to become part of a 'special projects' group being spun up with a number of industry-renowned engineers and designers; I would've been happy fetching coffee just to spend the time with them! 

That team never came to be, and I am now stuck working on a boring project and spend more time educating and helping my coworkers than they do contributing to my personal development (the entire reason I joined such a big company in the first place!).

I have been marked as a 'High Potential' employee by management, but I am deeply unhappy with the work I've completed and don't feel it's deserving of praise – we simply have extraordinarily low standards for our engineers. It's come to the point where I feel depressed just thinking about work, when I have always been someone overly committed to their job. As an intern at past companies it was not unusual for me to spend 100+ hours a week at the office pouring over source code and spending time talking with engineers across the company about the challenges they faced. Now I only work 10-3 and spend the rest of my time fooling around on TopCoder or taking MOOCs.

Is it too early to consider switching teams within the company, or perhaps leaving altogether? "

I'm currently in the process of writing a research report for my Technical Writing class (I'm a CS undergrad). The topic of my project is whether or not the university I attend does enough to prepare CS students for careers as software engineers after graduation. My interest in this topic stems from my work experience at my internship this past summer as well as my experience with my current job. 

In school, we primarily code in C/C++ and Java. For coding projects, we generally write simple projects that typically run from the command line and usually solve a single problem. As you can imagine, I was in for a bit of a rude awakening this summer when I had my first ever job in software engineering, developing web applications for a financial services company using Microsoft .NET. This type of programming proved to be very different and I spent most of my internship just learning how all these technologies worked (Visual Studio, the .NET framework, SQL Server, Mercurial, etc.). 

Now, I divided my project into five tasks: research tools and protocol used in a commercial setting, collect information from students, ask professors for their opinions, research the pros and cons of specific tools, and prepare the recommendation. Now, I've done 2-3 and have started on 5, which is when it dawned on me that I never really did 1 and 4. 

After thinking about it for a little, I decided perhaps the best way to go about this research would just be to ask people on a popular social networking site with an active Computer Science community, i.e reddit (and perhaps stack overflow as well, depending on how many responses this gets). 

To do this, I put together a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SN2S8QN) that I'd be really grateful if you filled out. If you have anything else to add or hate surveys for some reason, feel free to comment, they will get read. Thanks in advance to everyone who helps me out here, it is very much appreciated!

I changed my major during my sophomore year so I am a bit behind in some of my CS classes. I figured I needed to get experience so I'm looking at internships for summer 2015 right now but I didn't have a lot to put on my resume to begin with. 
My mother works at a software company in the Bay Area, and I asked her about their internship opportunities, hoping I could apply, but she ended up just talking to the hiring manager directly (without telling me until after the fact).

In short, I was told to send my resume and a cover letter to my mom who sent it to the hiring manager. Suddenly, I have a 30 minute phone interview in the near future for a position that I feel like was just randomly picked for me. I've never applied to an internship before so I'm not sure if a 30 minute phone call is standard for screening interns. After looking at the information about the internship online, I feel like I am completely under-qualified for the position - it requires working knowledge of UML and understanding of iterative development methodologies - things that I haven't even begun to touch yet. 

So, now I'm feeling like I was purposely given this to be rejected. Am I just being paranoid? Because it makes more sense when I think about because I really am under-qualified for this and feel like I only got a phone interview because of nepotism but didn't want to reject me outright which is why I wanted to apply to one of her company's internships without her involvement

2nlqrl,1,2014-11-27,I know what I want to do with my life; what major do I pick to get there?,recycledstardust,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2nlqrl/i_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life_what_major/,"I'm 16 years old, a senior in high school, and applying to colleges right now.

My whole life, I was sure I wanted to psychology or theatre, which are both very difficult fields to make money in. I knew that I didn't want to go into any serious ""hard sciences"" or math, but I didn't want to get too artsy, either. 


Through research, I found a field called ""Expressive arts therapy"" and that sounds like the most interesting thing ever. I never heard of it before this year, I'd only heard of ""clinical psychologist"" and ""social worker"" and all that. Of course, I think I would be happy working any job that had to do with psychology or theatre (I've been an actor before, I've written plays and had them produced, I've directed plays, and been backstage. I love all of those things equally). But expressive arts therapy seems like a really specifically interesting goal.


I also have finances in mind, so I looked for ways to make more money in expressive arts therapy. The baby boomer generation is getting older and the job growth in the gerontology field is apparently going to skyrocket. I want to get in on this, so I thought ""What if I got a job directing theatre with the elderly in rest homes?""


This sounds super niche and there's always the chance that I'll change my path completely (although the thought of that scares me a bit). Still, I want a job where:

1. I can incorporate lots of creativity and problem solving skills into social situations, because that's what I'm good at.

2. I can experience and help others experience the transformative properties of theatre.

3. I can provide some sort of comfort to people and make their days easier to live (especially if they're in a retirement home and they feel bored or condescended). I want to improve quality of life.

4. I want to work with people who are ""misunderstood"". This is where the selfishness definitely comes in...I'm a female, half-black, LGBT teenager with mental health issues. I've definitely been misunderstood and stigmatized. It makes me want to understand others who seek to be understood, but are often pushed aside (those on the autism spectrum, those with certain mental health challenges, the elderly, young children, immigrants, etc). I find it so enriching for me personally to work with those who are also stereotyped by society because I feel it's a common thread that can bring people together. 


So when applying to colleges, they ask my potential major, and I just don't know what to say. I've already applied to some colleges, under the psychology major (which is SO stupid in hindsight because that's so impacted in every school). I was thinking I could just minor in theatre. I feel like I have a few options but I don't know which is best:

1. Psychology with theatre minor. This is the broadest and I could do it at any school I go to because most schools have a psychology department and a theatre department.

2. Gerontology with theatre minor. This seems like a great option, but I'm scared I'll decide I don't want to work with the older population after all, and I won't ever be able to back out. Also, not many schools I'm applying to offer this.

3. Theatre with psychology minor. This seems like a ridiculous path, but within theatre I could possibly delve more into playwriting, directing, stage management, or theatre education of some sort. This seems unstable to me but it's an option.

4. Expressive arts therapy major. I think this is great and specific, but only one school I'm applying to has this major for undergrads (Lesley University, in Massachusetts). 

5. Social work with theatre minor. I'm not sure about this one because I haven't really researched what it really entails. 



How do I even BEGIN to decide or know which path will lead me to where I want to be? Should I just trust that, because I have a goal in mind, I'll get there somehow through internships and jobs I take? Advice is very appreciated!

I've been looking through some of the posts here, but ordering things from pcpartpicker with combos is way, way, waaaaay cheaper than ordering here through amazon or ebay. So I've been trying my best to put together a really cheap entry-level PC. As for me, I'll mostly use it to do homework(2 monitor full HD), play some League of Legends(at least medium+ 60fps in full HD without shadows), or some other not really PC-intensive tasks(visual novels, films, poker on 2 screens). I don't have much interest in any modern games, so being able to play any of them is optional. As a self-sufficient university student, I'm pretty short on money, and would happily switch out any of these parts if I can cut down on the cost while still being able to do everything I've written above. I'm not really planning on upgrading it for a few years, so that's not a consideration. Do keep in mind that most things on newegg cost less in dollars, than on amazon/ebay in euros.

I don't know whether i should start a full time job or try to pursue my masters. I'll explain in a minute, but here's a little background. 

I'm a senior in mechanical engineering that is going to graduate in April 2015. However, due to certain project team obligations, i will be busy until November of that year. This also means that i will not be taking any classes that semester. I have a ok (3.2ish) gpa with a long list of extra circular activities. I also have a decent amount of gov secured student debt. 

Now i can do one of two things: 

1. Get a job that starts in Nov 2015
3. Graduate in April 2015 and go directly into grad school starting Jan 2016.  

My problem is that if i start full time in November, i will have used most of my grace period months on my student loans and will begin to pay interest on those almost immediately. Also, i have never had an internship due to my involvement with project team and i'm worried i will be locked into a job for two years without knowing much about it. I want to work in the aerospace industry working with composite structure design. My prospects for jobs in those industries are good due to my ec working with composites.  

On the other hand, i can extend my stay at uni. I might be able to get a gsi position, but i don't qualify for the 5 year masters program, so i will be there for 2 years. This will give me time to get internships and determine more of what i want to do. It also eliminate some of the glass ceilings that are present at some of the companies that i want to work at. Or at least the glass ceilings that I've heard about.  But it delays my graduation and I don't know if i want to do pure engineering for the rest of life. I have a strong managerial side of my personality and i'm really considering wanting to get an MBA at a later point in my life. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and would you be able to give any advice on how i should make a decision? Or if you guys have suggestions at all, i would be happy to hear them. I'm really at a loss on how to decide between the options.

-Work experience: 2 internships (admin work, second was a position requiring a bilingual), teaching English, research assistant, teaching assistant

My original plan was to go on to a PhD but I've changed my mind. Now I want to find a job in Washington DC or NYC that lets me use my language/international skills. 

Problems:

1. Will be moving with basically no savings. I cannot work another job here due to the work laws of this country. Grad stipend just covers bills without much room to save. I don't even have enough to buy more than one suit. Cannot rent an apartment without security deposit or proof of employment presumably.  

2. No family I can rely on. Literally not even a couch (my family likes me, but they are poor and small and somebody is already crashing there).  

3. After being abroad so long, I don't feel tight enough with my friends from undergrad to just ask them to let me stay with them.  


I definitely need to go home after this program ends. The country in which I am living is very patriarchal (I am a woman) and the jobs available aren't great. However, financially and socially I have no idea how I can actually re-integrate back into the United States. I pretty much can afford a plane ticket back and then I'm just a homeless bum  I guess?

2nqenb,7,2014-11-29,"[Build Help]Already have a main pc, need something portable",IAmAGranary,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2nqenb/build_helpalready_have_a_main_pc_need_something/,"I already have a cyberpower PC that I got as a gift that does pretty well for me.  But the thing is huge, and I'm a college student right now, so when I go back home for holidays or go work an internship over the holiday I can't really bring it with me without shipping it, which I don't like doing.  So I'm looking for something more portable - a pc that can fit in a bag so I can carry it on a flight home for winter break for example.  My main purpose would be gaming as well.  Also I feel like I don't need a laptop because whenever I need to game I'm in a stationary place for a month at least, I just go back and forth a lot so I can't bring my main computer all of those times.


My current PC has an i5 3570k and a Radeon HD 7970, so those are things I could feasibly take out of my main rig and just put into my portable rig when I want to use it (though that graphics card is huge so that might be a problem).

My budget would ideally be around $1000, though I could go up to around $1300. 

Any advice on a case that could fit that video card but still be small enough to fit in a bag?  And what else I would need to make this work? I haven't fully built a PC ever so I am pretty green.


I've also considered a couple prebuilt options - something like an ibuypower revolt or some sort of a steam machine because those seem really portable.  I probably won't use this past the next few years too much because I'll be going back and forth a lot less, so upgradability isn't too much of a worry.  So any thoughts on doing something like this?  It would undoubtedly be more money or less performance, but I don't necessarily need this to be a beast, I just need to not go crazy when I'm stuck in a random state by myself at my internship this summer.

But... They almost seem too good to be true...

It's a two month intensive program, you work 12+ hours a day. And by the end of it they get you a job through their many connections and networks. They 100% guarantee you a paid full time job or internship. 

Now, the price is a little steep. $8,000. But... If they guarantee you work that's just a minor investment you would be making back plus more within the first year? 

Are these things legitimate for finding work? I have no degree and only a few months experience with programming. On their site they even say no prior knowledge of programming is required... Interesting.  

I'm a little skeptical, but I've been reading stories online and they all seem to be promising thus far... I'm still a little worried this is all some elaborate money scheme though. "
2nry56,2,2014-11-29,Need help making an important decision for an internship.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2nry56/need_help_making_an_important_decision_for_an/,"Hello,

So I have a bit of dilemma.

Yesterday I had interviews at two places I thought both interview went really well. Place 1 seemed kinda boring, the salary is average but I could pursue the job during the summer and maybe during the rest of my studies and the team seems cool too. Place 2 seems like the work will be exciting, a lot harder, I will be learning a lot and also pays better, I doubt I'll be able to continue with this job after the internship is over... the team seems intense. But this job really interests me as the place is prestigious in my eyes. The interview was really intense at Place 2 while the interview at Place 1 was quick and easy

Problem is I get very anxious and depressed when I feel I don't perform well, I feel I won't be good enough for Place 2 even if they want me. Place 1 feels like I'm going to be able to do the boring job go back home, make my money and then be completely be able to forget about it at night or during the weekend. I haven't been severely depressed for a good year or more but I feel like Place 2 could trigger it. I also feel that if I don't take Place 2 I might regret it later. Place 1 called me the day of the interview to tell me they wanted me for the job. I wanted to get the answer from Place 2 before telling them I accept.

I thought Monday I would call Place 2 and ask them if they want me because I have another offer and I can't wait, so have to make a choice. I though if Place 2 wants me I'll go there, otherwise I'll just call back Place 1 and tell them I accept their offer. The problem is I don't even know if I want Place 2 anymore even if they want me... This would be my first job in IT so you can understand I am very scared and troubled. I often make bad decision and I really want to make the right one this time.

I hope someone can help me with this decision and thanks for reading.

P.S: English isn't my first language so sorry for the mistakes."

I'm 20, currently studying in a so-called University of Applied Sciences in Europe. My degree is IT relevant but what I've learned at school is just some basic shit. I've been digging around Coursera, Udemy, EdX to learn fundamental CS courses that my school don't have (Algorithms and Data Structures, Machine Learning, Data Sciences...). I do not regret for being there but just realized my dream is bigger than my degree. 
I'm still have about two years left before graduate. My current plan is keep self-studying, work my ass off to get a good internship, and find a Master degree in a well-known Uni around Europe.
I have a strong interest in software dev, and data science (Python, Java..). 
Any advice in career path? I will appreciate all of your comments :)."
2nstme,6,2014-11-29,Conflict over whether to quit my research group,WiiPu,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2nstme/conflict_over_whether_to_quit_my_research_group/,"I'm a junior in college and I got a position as an undergraduate volunteer research assistant last June. When the professor and I were discussing expectations for my involvement, we decided that the minimum amount of involvement would be ~40hrs/week in the summer and ~13 hrs/week for the fall semester. In the summer I mostly assisted my grad student w/ various tasks, and at the start of the fall semester I got my own project to work on. Well, it's the middle of the fall semester and I think I want to quit after the semester ends. No one in my research group has any idea; they think I want to work in the lab until I graduate (though I have never expressed such sentiments).

However, I learned I'm not very passionate about the research and the possibility of grad school for the subject, and I haven't been able to balance schoolwork and lab work very effectively (along with bouts of depression/suicidal thoughts). The nature of the work involves setting aside large amounts of time (sometimes up to 7 straight hrs of active work) to complete experiments, and I feel this is very difficult to do with a challenging course load. These facts may be just excuses, though. I'm satisfied with the amount of time I put into the lab during the summer, but I haven't put in near the amount of time that was expected during the fall (~6-8 hrs/week as opposed to 13hrs/week). I do make sure to communicate with my grad student my time difficulties.

My conflict lies in the facts that I:

1) haven't made any real progress on my project. That is, I have practically nothing to show after a semester's worth of work. It seems that every week during group meetings when we discuss updates in our research I have nothing to present. Every goddamn week, and it's my fault. I know. This ties into my not putting in the hours to get experiments done.

2) The grad student who I work with has invested an incredible amount of time in helping me learn about techniques and concepts about the research, and I haven't contributed anything close to justify the level of support I've received. My leaving the group would be a lost investment when he was expecting me to stay and possibly publish results.

3) I recently received an internship offer at a company for the following summer, and I just told my professor the exciting news. However, I feel that telling him now about want to quit might make him feel used as a means to an end and bad feelings may be had. Though I do value his being one of my references, my sentiments about the group existed long prior to the news about the internship. That being said, I don't know how leaving would affect our relationship and the potential for him to still be a valuable reference...

The question is, do I continue paying my dues into the next semester, or should I tell my professor my feelings, and what would be the most gracious way to do so while protecting our relationship? I love being around the grad students and the professor as they are great people and have contributed a lot to my personal development, but I just don't want to do the research anymore. It's not like I wouldn't be doing nothing next semester (there's a tutoring gig that really interests me)

I don't know, any words of advice would be greatly appreciated. It just made me feel a little better to write this down as I am feeling very stressed about the situation. Thanks for reading.

2nt90w,1,2014-11-29,To gap year or to stay in school?,ctrembs03,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2nt90w/to_gap_year_or_to_stay_in_school/,"Hello Redditors. I've got a situation here and I need your good help. 

Background: I'm a sophomore in a state college (money reasons), currently studying exercise science. I got great grades in high school and took a bunch of APs, and my grades in college are also not bad. However, I have several problems with my college adventure thus far. My college is HUGE, and I feel strongly disconnected from the entire experience. I've got zero passion for what I'm studying, and I feel like I'm surrounded by people who just don't seem like they're going anywhere. Also, I don't really know what I want to do career wise- I'm in the exercise science program simply to get some sort of an undergraduate degree, intending to do my post-undergrad somewhere more specialized to whatever it is I'll end up doing (I do know I want to be in some kind of a therapeutic field working with children, which is why I chose exercise science). While in school full time, I'm also working full time in a desperate attempt to save some money while funding both my education and my general life- I moved out of my childhood home and away from my family, because my dad lost his job recently and he's got a huge family to support (7 kids total, myself included).

So: here I am, a young Redditor, living on her own and working full time, while also going to school full time, for an education I am utterly apathetic for. I've been doing this for three semesters and I'm simply unhappy; I feel like I'm wasting both my time and my money on a future I don't see myself fitting into. I feel like going to this state college was the right decision at the time, money wise, but was really a mistake in disguise, because rather than working towards my future, I'm just putting myself more and more in debt towards something I just don't care that much about. (more background: not caring about school is NOT NORMAL for me. I've always prided myself on doing well, academically, and I have zero motivation to put any effort towards this degree, which is another indicator that I'm doing something wrong with myself.)

Proposed solution: take a gap year. I've got a growing list of things I would do if I had a year wothout studying to do them (volunteer, learn personal financing, learn sign language, work on a children's book...), and it would allow me to intern in different jobs to figure out what the best fit for me is. It would also give me the freedom to leave my current job, which I hate and am only working in because it fits around my school schedule, and work in a daycare or as a general classroom aid to gain professional experience with children. I'd also be able to put real time into building a network of professional contacts, by volunteering within fields that I am interested in, career-wise. Then in a year, when I feel I've got more of a handle on my future and my life skills (I left home when I went to school, and I honestly still don't feel I have all the random everyday adult skills necessary to call myself ""independent"" yet), I can start looking at returning to school to TRULY focus on working towards my future. 

Problem: taking a gap year would mean I have to start paying off my student loans six months after I leave school, and then I'd have to keep paying till they were gone. This isn't impossible, but it would be challenging, and would make it tricky to take out any loans later in life when I go back to school. Also, my parents (who are very conservative and very careful and UTTERLY the opposite of me) keep telling me that once you leave college the ""studying mentality"" disappears and I'll never end up going back, so I'm very paranoid about that.

Here's the thing. I love learning and I have no intention of being a college dropout. However, I don't think going straight into a college (that I  chose only because it was cheap) right after high school with no clear career goals in mind was the right option for me, and I can honestly say that given the chance to go back to my senior year, I would absolutely not do it again.

Please provide insight, Reddit! Now that I'm two years in (no matter what I'm still finishing out next semester), is taking a gap year still a good idea? And if it is, how do I do it? Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation, and if so, what did you do about it?"

Being in Sacramento I am just 2 hours outside of what i would consider the bay area, however downtown sacramento seems to be growing, especially with the new arena and surrounding development. 

I am 27 with 2 kids and would rather not relocate my entire family, and would HATE to commute out to the bay area every day. The only local tech jobs I know of are in Folsom (much closer) but as far as I know there is only Intel, IBM, and HP. 

so i have a few questions,
Are these companies enough to put my mind at ease as far as finding an internship in a year and job after I graduate?
Do i simply need to look harder locally, or are all the jobs just in the bay area?
should i expect pay to be dramatically less in the Sacramento area compared to the bay area?
should I be concerned that I will be seeking an internship and employment at the age of 30 with no experience?

Honestly I went back to school because I was tired of wearing down my body, working way to many hours, making way too little money and never seeing my family, I have gotten quite used to living off of roughly 40k a year, all these claims of salaries starting at 80k are making me light headed."
