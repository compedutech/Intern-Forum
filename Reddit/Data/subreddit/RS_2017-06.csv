I've applied for a lot of internships with no luck, so I decided to start working again part-time as a lifeguard at home. Then, I got an interview for a Full-Stack Web Development Internship at a local company, which I just finished. They said they really liked me, but didn't catch that I would be returning to an out of state university at the end of the summer. They said that in their experience, it takes about 2 months before an intern can start making meaningful contributions, and so they wouldn't be able to offer a paid internship for the summer since I'd be leaving right away and they have lots of very competitive applicants who go to a local university and could stay on. However, they did offer me an unpaid internship. Usually I'd steer clear of unpaid work, but at this point in the summer I don't think that I'll be able to get any other related internship. I would be working on their web application with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. 

The two developers who interviewed me seemed very sincere and apologized for not catching the fact that I would be leaving. Would this experience be worth working unpaid? They said that after a 2 week training period I would be able to set my own schedule since it's unpaid (whereas regular interns work 20 hours per week at $10 per hour). Thanks!"

6ejzzm,2,2017-05-31,Suffered a mental breakdown and dropped out of school and don't want to pursue the field I was in school for? I don't know where to go from here now,pinhead94,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6ejzzm/suffered_a_mental_breakdown_and_dropped_out_of/,"I am in fourth year of school and would have had about 2 or 3 more quarters (about a year). I was trying to get a Bachelor's in computer science but have been struggling due to the anxiety and depression I have had for years. School, but for some reason not working, has always prompted me into very bad anxiety and depressive episodes to the point of suicidal thoughts.

I did take a break from school to just work in a restaurant job for minimum wage and actually grew to like it and tolerate it. It wasn't fulfilling, meaningful, and it was still stressful as hell but I liked that 9-to-5 time structure where once I was done with work I was done and when I could get home, I could truly decompress and properly work on my mental issues and stay the best version of myself. Also with a finite time limit each day, I could always just focus only on the job and not feel like I am always multitasking.

 Looking back, even if it is with rose-colored-glasses, as a time in my life, where I was happy and could feel myself being more mentally stable and improving as a person. 

I actually have a summer internship/job lined up for a few months. The thing is that it is in my field, I'll be working on a Java database app, but after everything that has happened, I do not want to pursue anything in this field anymore. The only reason I stayed in school for so long was because I was afraid of having to face the fact that I don't have any real passions or do not know what to do with my life anymore. I thought that as I would progress closer to graduation, everything would become clearer but it hasn't, the only thing that was clear was that I hated school and just wanted to get out and start working.

I guess I will stop ranting and just ask for guidance. I do not want to go back to school for anything at least not for 1 year. I just want to survive enough to eventually live alone and have enough to pay for utilities and all the other amenities needed to live i.e. (insurance, phone, internet, gas, food, etc.) Right now I live with my mom but I want to move out or at least start contributing more to the family more. I know Front-end development like HTML/CSS/Javascript/Jquery/AngularJS as well as database languages like MongoDB, mySQL and other languages like C++/Java/Python and have made applications like text processors, search engines, basic client and server programs.

I have had 4 restaurant/grocery jobs before this. In terms of my skills I have the programming knowledge and some side projects I have made or contributed to on CodePen and GitHub. 

I managed to get an internship for the summer, that pays like 17/hour and is roughly full time. As I said before, school has kind of burned me out of computers and programming so I am prepared for the realization that I will hate it and am prepared to completely change fields. 

Regardless of what happens, I want to know what should I do with myself. Right now, I just want work that is not excessively social, or not being completely dependent on being charismatic. I don't mind physical labor and was considering working with my dad in cargo handling in an airport and it pays enough to survive. Honestly, moving and being physical was I loved about my jobs from the past and one theing I hate about computer science is constantly staring and sitting at a computer screen feeling my body atrophy. 

I guess in terms of the job I want, a routine where things are somewhat predictable like working in the back of the house of a restaurant or cargo handling is what would be better for me. Is there any field of IT that would accept without a Bachelor's degree?

I feel really lost and not sure what direction I should go in my life. Any advice whatsoever would be a great help. All I know is that I cannot do anymore school, the environment just doesn't mesh well with me. I guess some suggestions as to what fields or jobs I should pursue without a degree in order to eventually live on my own in Southern California. "

Since you are all older and wiser than me, I was hoping someone could give me some insight into this decision. 

On one side, I feel like I'm doing pretty well at UMD (which is a decent school for Computer Science?) and there's no point switching it up. On the other hand, I feel like I might kick myself 10 years down the line for not taking the opportunity to transfer to Cornell and really push myself (and enjoy the doors opened with a degree from an Ivy League).

6el2ik,51,2017-06-01,TIFU by getting high with strep throat,awmathie,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6el2ik/tifu_by_getting_high_with_strep_throat/,"Unlike most TIFU's I read, this is actually happening right now, I'm waiting for the RA to come let me in. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some relevant background info: I'm in a dorm room I got because of a programming internship thing, most of the people here are pretty straightedged and are not the type to smoke weed, and I am sick. I think I have strep throat, but that’s probably just me being a hypochondriac, and I actually just have a weird cold. The sore throat from this cold has lasted 3 days and my throat has been killing me for the past 12 hours, I really just want something to make my throat not hurt. For the past two nights I've used cough drops and had no problem watching code geass and sleeping, but I got new cough drops when I woke up around noon, and they were not doing shit. I don't know if I bought the shitty kind of cough drops or what, because they taste fucking delicious and they don’t help AT ALL. Like since I woke up today my throat has been in pain, and it’s steadily gotten worse throughout the day, to the point that right now as I’m typing this I am spitting saliva into a cup so I don’t have to swallow because my throat hurts so much.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself. The TIFU really started after I finished playing melee with my roommates a few hours ago, and I said fuck it, I’m gonna smoke some goddamn weed to help my throat. Now obviously the idea of inhaling burning, acrid smoke full of THC through your throbbing trachea so tender that you can’t swallow isn’t a good idea, but I like weed and I’ve established a fucking ritual of smoking before and after I play melee with my roommates over the past 9 months. And I’m just a fucking idiot lol
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Ok but anyhoo, after stumbling through the dark unfamiliar campus (just moved here) with my phone and a bag containing a bong, a bottle of water, a lighter, and some goddamn weed, I eventually found a creepy spot under a highway overpass kinda thing on some random corner of campus. After scouting it out, I smoked like some creepy underpass meth goblin. I immediately felt weird smoking by myself, under a bridge, in the complete dark, in a city I moved into like 2 days ago, but I had already made the long trek, so I started smonking. My throat hurt a little at first, but I kept going, until two bowls later I was about to throw up my throat hurt so badly.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I immediately stopped smoking and made my way back to my dorm room, where I was accosted by my roommate. He was rambling about some bullshit, I had borrowed his key card since I already lost mine, so he started to talk about locking himself out of his room last week, and what to do if I lock myself out of my room.  I was starting to really feel the weed kick in, so I kind of pretended to listen and focused on not acting high, as I really don't think this guy would be cool with me smoking weed. I managed to slip into my room while he kept talking, so I could watch some disguisedtoast stream some fighting game that is definitely not hearthstone. Battlefield player unkown maybe? But like all one word? Anyway, while watching, my throat was slowly hurting more and more, and at this point the high is here and I am fairly baked, so I came up with the brilliant idea of holding my mouth open like a dog and letting the slobber run off of my tongue into a cup, thereby preventing me from swallowing, which was just fucking wracking me with pain.
 
&amp;nbsp;

After like an hour of watching twitch I realized I wanted to jerk the gurkin, so I locked my door, turned off the lights, and went to town. After finishing, I went to the bathroom to pee and wash my hands, because I'm not a fucking savage, and then I walked back to my room only to realize I fucking locked myself out, I had done the exact thing my roommate had just been warning me about. Anyway, I luckily had my phone on me (browsing reddit while in the bathroom), so I called the RA on duty and she's on her way here. Right now I am standing outside my dorm room in my boxers, with my tongue hanging out and slobber drooling into a cup, high as a something other than a kite, and with a faint miasma of pot and cum hovering about me. I just can't wait to meet my RA lol

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR I smoked weed with a sore throat, locked myself out of my room, and am now waiting for my RA with slobber running out of my mouth because it hurts so much to swallow. ~~smoke weed every day~~"
6el49n,1,2017-06-01,Why do I feel like this is a fool's deal?,_diarmuid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6el49n/why_do_i_feel_like_this_is_a_fools_deal/,"I'm in my first dev job after a couple internships and 2 profitable personal projects (1 project has a decent/consistent following, the other being the more profitable one). I took the job for the experience, but after a few short months, I am anticipating stagnation.

I love the people I work with, but there's no one here to mentor me, which I consider to be a major downside. We're a small shop, and it appears to me that my boss thinks I only know some HTML, but that's not the case.

So here's the aforementioned deal:

We had a meeting with the sales team, founders, and PMs. After looking over their current eCommerce situation, I advised them on a course of action and made mention that I had built my own API before. They took interest, so I demoed it for them since it's live.

They were quite impressed. And it gave them the idea to have me build APIs for their eCommerce site, but also for them to sell to other merchants to build extra streams of revenue for the company. 

Now regarding that, it's a good idea from a business owner's perspective, yes. But from a dev's perspective, it's not making much sense. I don't really need them to make these APIs, I can do it myself. And it'd be sort of annoying that, since they would own them, I'd only be able to work on them at work from a work-owned computer.

They did mention that I'd make a portion of the income, and I'm not greedy, it's just that I was already doing this in my spare time anyway (hence how I had an live API to show them), so I'm not sure where they fit into this.

Aside from that, I'm making a good bit below Jr dev pay. I thought they knew this or would figure this out, but now I understand that they don't have any idea how much devs are going for in the Tri-State area. 

During the meeting, the IT supervisor had some questions, and let's just say it revealed to me that hardware is definitely his thing. I've already restructured (with great improvement) the backend design of an old in-house app they built, and introduced the workplace to version control and testing. According to some books I'm reading (The Software Craftsman and 12 Essential Skills of a Software Architects), and the engineering blogs I read, this isn't Jr dev responsibility. 

I'm feel more than happy to take this role and responsibility on, however, due to my financial situation, I need more compensation. Also, I only have 4 years of experience, so I would like to be mentored more, which can't happen at my job. Also, we're kind of stuck, since if we decided to bring in an additional developer, it's unlikely she would take &lt; $42K/year (again, we're in the Tri-state area).

**TL;DR**

My boss wants me to devote the next month or so developing APIs as new revenue streams for the company, but I've already begun working on that in my spare time, and I don't need any resources from work to accomplish this. As far as I'm concerned I'd just be diluting my passive income. In addition, I feel that I'm handling lead developer work/responsibility and I'm making less than jr level pay, and struggling financially.

I know part of the solution is simply to ask for a raise, but there's also the lack of mentorship I'd be committing to if I did that.

Other jobs are also offering as much as double pay (or more) *and* benefits, which I'd really like for my family.

I love these people, and they depend on me a lot. What I would like to do is go ahead and find another job (my linkedin has a lot of recruiter messages), but also help my current workplace out by building an API or two, and showing them how to go about finding a new developer to bring in in my place. Is that fair?

By the way, do these kinds of deals get proposed often in this industry??"

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science with CIS Option from a local state college last year. I live in Alabama, within a 2-hour drive to Nashville TN, Huntsville AL, and Birmingham AL. I had to spend a year at my current employer before I could leave because of tuition reimbursement stipulations. I'm now ready to find a job that fits my degree, but I'm having the hardest time even getting a call back, much less an interview or a foot in the door.

In the past year since I graduated, I've tried to keep learning as much as I can. I started with freeCodeCamp and am currently a little past halfway through its curriculum. I also made my own website using Digital Ocean at www.creativen00b.com to act as a portfolio and a place to share any projects I make. And lastly, I started on The Odin Project just this last weekend to change things up and learn something new (Ruby, RoR). 

I realize I have very little experience to offer, as I have no internships to leverage and have only had a little time to work on side projects because I've had to work so much. But so far, in the past month I have applied to well over 100 jobs (possibly double that amount, as I know for a while I was applying to 5-10 a day, almost every day) and I've only had one interview. Those few that have contacted me have basically said, ""You seem like you would be a fit for a junior position, but we unfortunately do not have any at this time.""  

So my question is basically this: is there anything else I can do? Just keep applying and keep learning/making projects? Something I haven't even thought of? If it wasn't for family obligations, I'd say I would be willing to move to a more populated area for a job, but unfortunately that's out of the question.

Anyway, thanks for any advice you can give. I will put any given to good use."

Is it career limiting to take a software developer job as opposed to an engineering gig as a starting place after school? 

As a bit of background, I went to a mediocre school but was top of my class and think I want to work with hardware, rf circuits and antennas. I have a year of intern experience that ended up being software QA but had a pretty incredible starting  job lined up in hardware design that I got through a friend. Because of some security clearance issues, they rescinded the offer and now I'm stuck without any momentum. I need to stay in Denver and it seems to be a very competitive market for entry level. I'm finding that I only catch the eye of software/IT hiring managers. I guess I'm looking for advice as to whether it is better career-wise to wait for a good starting job title or to take what I can get to begin with.

He has only been programming for less than a year, and most of his experience now is just with the basic Java that he has been learning.  He seems to be competent with what he has learned so far, but it still isn't that much.

Since he is unlikely to be able to provide actual support with the high-level complicated programming that the rest of us are working on, I'm hoping to have him focus primarily on learning new technologies and the like while he sits in on our meetings and discussions in order to see what the 'real world' of programming is like.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out what sort of challenges I should give him.  With only one year of Java under his belt, I'm not sure what sort of challenges are actually *good* for him.

My initial ideas were to introduce him to databases, or to version control systems, or to unique languages like Haskell or Lisp... but I figure that most or all of my ideas are too advanced for a freshman.  So now I'm thinking about trying to give him, say, Python tutorials and challenges... but I'm not quite sure what is a good self-led Python tutorial for someone with limited experience in programming as a whole.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, with a student / mentee relationship?  What sort of educational resources of techniques did you use in that situation?

I want to do everything I can for this intern, but I still have my own duties and responsibilities to take care of, so I can't give him my undivided attention.  I guess I also don't want to go too far in the other direction, treating him as nothing more than a child, either...."

I'm not here to complain about that, it's my own fault, by I really could use help going forward. I want to take a break from school and do an internship.

Now for the question...

I can't seem to find any internships that don't require you to be a full time student for the duration. While I am technically still a student, I wouldn't be full time for the period I'd like to do the internship and am not in great standing with the school regardless. Is there anything that just requires the know how(I can code in the unity and unreal engines with some proficiency)? I'm not even picky about it being a game design internship(though, computer science related is still preferred). Where do I start? What should I look for?"

I've been at my summer internship for a week now. It's been going well, learning a lot every day and I love the environment. However, I've started to pick up that I'm asking a lot more questions than the other interns and it's starting to mess with my head. Some of them I know are good questions, aimed to help me understand the architecture and design choices more. But a large amount are still just ""help me, I'm stuck"" type questions, and those are what are getting under my skin. 

If I have a problem, I'll try to figure it out on my own. If I can't figure it out in 20 minutes or so I'll usually ask someone. It's almost always issues with configuring and stitching things together - I'm still working on setting up the development environment. So an example might be I'm given a document on how to setup a local server with one of their projects on it so I can debug. I'll run into some error or issue and try to figure it out for 20 mins and then eventually have to call for help, turns out I needed to import some external library or tweak a config file. On one hand, I don't see how I could figure these things out on my own. On the other hand, I don't see my fellow interns asking nearly as many questions as I am. 

So, two questions:    
**1. Is this a red flag?**

**2. How do you deal with debugging issues that are related to company-specific software and such?** I'm used to being able to poke around Google and find clues/answers from similar issues. But a lot of these problems are so domain-specific (and dealing with internally-made tools) that Google simply is no use. "

I'm a 26-yo Brazilian guy. I have a 5-year Computer Engineering degree from a top Brazilian university. Currently, I am a MSc student (part-time) at the same university. In parallel, I work full-time (40h/week) in a R&amp;D company since 2015 in projects involving image processing and computer vision (Python, C++, Assembly).

So, I am interesting in doing an internship overseas (US, Canada or Europe) in a project that involves Deep Learning, as this is the subject of my research (the master's program in my university is mainly focused on academic research). As a master's student, I know I can apply for internships, but I have some questions regarding this:

* Do companies usually offer internships for international students? I know that big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc.) do that, but how about smaller companies and startups and companies in different industries (medical, automotive etc.)?
* When applying for an internship, is my 3-year work experience good, neutral or actually bad?
* I will probably be questioned about why I want to quit my stable full-time job to do an internship. The (sincere) reasons are that I want an international experience and to work with more challenging problems that involve deep learning. Also, after the internship, I want to dedicate my time only to finishing my master's research. Are these reasons ok for an interviewer?
* Is this a good idea? Financially speaking, a well-paying internship (US$5k or more / month) will pay more than three times my current wage. A three-month internship can make up for some months without a job in Brazil. In terms of career perpectives, I think that an internship in my field of study can open some doors to an international full-time job in the future."

Normally I would be thrilled with this type of opportunity, however there are very important issues with how I perceive this internship

1) I feel like (or rather I know for sure) that I got this because of parental connections rather than personal skill. While nice that I am lucky with something like this, it is a huge blow to my confidence and I'm constantly second guessing myself

2) I am by far the youngest in the entire division; only 20 years old, entering my third year in uni. The average employee is about 35. I haven't even started my third CS course (just finished data structures) and I'm working alongside extremely accomplished people. The other intern in my department is 23 and working on his phd and the topic is incredible (don't want to be too specific but its related to lung cancer and tracking with a smart watch).

3) It's using a platform I've never used before (although I've used the language) and even though we're using Java to code, I find myself constantly AFRAID. I don't know if I'm doing the most efficient method, or if I'm missing something completely obvious that any other person in the room would immediately see. I'm afraid of being ""exposed"" as a fraud (at least this is how I feel constantly) and it makes me extremely nervous whenever I'm working. Last year even though I was interning at a hospital I didn't feel this sort of pressure but for whatever reason I feel afraid and anxious all the time. Also, when looking through the source code, there's just SO MUCH. I feel extremely overwhelmed at simply the volume I have to look through and understand how it works. I'm a believer in that every line of code should be understood to really get a full grasp of the project and there's just huge chunks that I just don't understand.

Most of all, I'm just so scared to ask any questions; this internship should've gone to someone a lot more qualified than I am and I feel like any question I have is one that would put a damper on the project because the rest of the team has an undergraduate student that got in using parental influence and they were obligated to drag along.

Anyone else experience anything like this? I just feel so alone in all of this and no one, absolutely no one in my age group or friend group can relate to me with this."

2. Also, I got an offer as an online intern at a small web and mobile development company. I would be trained and get to build production ready app.

I could't follow both of these at the same time because I still have to go to school so I need to choose one. 

My current interest right now is full stack dev so I think the second option would be better for me to become a professional developer. However, should I consider the first option more? I would be exposed to software defined radio and machine learning too.

I'm still inexperienced in these kinds of thing so some advices will help very much. Which one is better in your opinion? I'm really appriciated for your help

I started studying CS last fall as a sophomore. I was a semester behind in the typical track and only just completed an intro to DS and Algs class this spring. I went to our career fair and talked to about a dozen companies, along with applying to dozens of businesses and postings. I had around 5-6 interviews and narrowed one position down to just me and one other guy, but didn't get the position. I was told at another company that they might have a position in July or August but nothing for now. 

I lost hope after applying for nearly 100 postings over 4 months. I applied for a student IT job and was dreading the thought of slogging through something I wasn't too interested in. I got an email from Indeed saying a pretty big tech company near me had an internship position open so I applied, expecting to not hear back. A week later I was emailed for an interview and two days after that I went in. It was pretty short, very relaxed, and pretty easy. But three days after that I got the call saying that I was accepted. I'm finishing up the pre employment stuff now and I'll likely be starting next week or monday the 12th, but I finally got an internship. 

So to everyone out there who may not be too confident in themselves or may still be looking for a position this summer, just keep looking. Even May isn't too late to secure a position. Post your resume, get help here and read up on interviewing tips. Someone will eventually bite and you'll get the chance to start your career. I'm glad I didn't give up and settle for anything less.

Demographics:

While Male, Upstate NY

Intended Major:

Not sure, CS + Math maybe?

Stats:
SAT - 1560 (760RW, 800M) 1st try, won't retake
GPA - 3.9 ish (our school is out of 100, I have roughly a 95)
Taking SAT2 Math 2, Physics, and USH tomorrow, expecting 800s in Math 2 and Physics.

Academics:

By time of applying, I will have taken or be taking:
AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C (Mech and E&amp;M), AP Computer Science A, AP Economics, APUSH, AP Statistics, AP Lang, AP Euro, AP Chemistry, AP Spanish, AP Biology, Multi-variable Calculus, and Linear Algebra (at a local CC).

Extracurriculars:

Math League (4 years) - 
Been on our school's A team for 2 years. Chosen by coach and peers to be captain for next year (senior). I've finished in the top 30 in the county for the last 2 years (10th and 11th) and will next year also. This placed me on the team to represent our county at NYSML, which I've also attended twice (and will attend again). As captain, I'll be making several improvements such as moving signups online with Google Docs, holding regular team meetings to practice problems and teach concepts, and making a team website.

Science Olympiad (3 years) - 
Been on our school's A team for 2 years. Elected by peers to be president for next year (senior). This year I placed 1st in Astronomy and 4th in Optics at the county competition. Our team advanced to the state competition, where I placed 6th in Astronomy (out of top 50 teams in NY). I'm going to make a lot of changes to the way the team is run, including regular check-ins on progress so our team can do a lot better next year.

Orchestra (3 years) - 
I play trumpet. In 10th grade, I was principal trumpet in an orchestra at a music school in a nearby city. In 11th grade, I auditioned for the most prestigious orchestra of that music school and got in. This orchestra is one of the 2 most prestigious youth orchestras in the city. I will continue to play in it next year (12th grade), and I might (crossing fingers) get principal trumpet.

Jazz (4 years) - 
In my school there are 2 jazz groups - Jazz Band and Jazz Ensemble. Jazz Band is mostly underclassmen and isn't difficult to get in, but Jazz Ensemble is mostly upperclassmen and difficult to get into. In freshman year, I played principal trumpet in Jazz Band and 4th trumpet in Jazz Ensemble. Ever since, I've just been in Jazz Ensemble. I now play lead trumpet in Jazz Ensemble, and will continue. We've played in the Rochester International Jazz Festival for the last 3 years, and might again next year.

Cross Country (2? years) - 
I did XC for the first time this year (11th grade) and wasn't good enough for varsity, so I was on JV. Next year, if I continue it, I will get a varsity letter and automatically be on the varsity team. I will probably continue.

Solo Festival (5 years) -
I've been auditioning at Solo Festival each year since 8th grade. Each year I've done well enough to be invited to the All-County Band, and last year (10th grade) I qualified for Area All-State band. I hope to qualify for Conference All-State Band in the fall, but we'll see.

Robotics (1 year) - I did robotics in 10th grade and was on the programming team, but I didn't like how it was run and all the work was done by the top couple programmers, so I didn't continue (kinda regret this)

NHS (1 year) - I recently was inducted to NHS. It's NHS, not much to say lol.

Chess Club (4 years) - I go to chess club meetings afterschool to play chess, and attend meets.

Internship at U Rochester Laser Lab for Energetics - 
This summer I have an 8 week paid internship at the LLE at U of R. This is a selective internship, and only 12 out of over 60 people around the county get selected. I will write a research paper and submit it for both the Siemens Competition and the Regeneron STS.


Awards:

AIME Qualifier - Scored 100.5 on the AMC 12B (Feb 2017), and a 5 on the AIME I.

National Spanish Exam - Got a Gold Medal in Level 3 (95 percentile) and Silver Medal in Level 4 (91 percentile).

Clarkson University High School Achievement Award - 
In recognition of outstanding leadership qualities and academic promise. From the website: ""Qualified students will demonstrate leadership and outstanding academic achievement. Nominations are made by high school guidance counselors during the student's junior year of high school with final approval made by Clarkson University""

RIT Physics Olympiad Honorable Mention - I finished top 15 in the county.

American Chemical Society Achievement Award - Top 10% average in both Honors and AP Chemistry, 9th and 10th grade respectively.

Recommendations:

Will be asking from my math team coach (taught me 9th and 10th grade, chose me as captain) and Spanish teacher (had me for 2 years - 10th and 11th, likes me a lot).

Schools:

MIT, Caltech, Harvey Mudd, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, UC Hicago, UCLA, UC Berkeley, U Rochester.

(Yes, I realize most of those are high reaches, but I want to know if I even have a chance of getting in).

Second, if I am in the right spot, I've looked through the rules and the FAQ's and don't see this question anywhere, so I'm hoping all you beautiful redditors can help me out. 

As the title says, I'll have my Associates (specifically, the title is ""Software Applications and Design Associates Degree"") completed in September of this year. The time has come for me to figure out the best next step to completing my CS degree, and that's where I'm hoping you can help. Here are the facts (apologies if some of them aren't relevant, I'm just trying to be thorough):

1.  I am 38 years old, with children and a wife.

2. My GPA is 3.92

3. I live in Pennsylvania.

4. I am willing to relocate pretty much anywhere, as long as I can logistically make it happen. I am currently the GM of a restaurant, but before that I was a bartender/server, so I'm always willing to go back to doing that to make ends meet while I'm finishing school.

5. I am looking for a college that is reasonably priced, but has a good CS department that I can really learn in. One of my biggest fears is that I'm going to have a hard time finding a job after school due to my age, so a school that has a good track record of decent internship opportunities or a career services department that will help me would be awesome. It's a real (even if unreasonable) concern for me.

6. I am a hard worker, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to continue to grow a future for my family. 

7. I'll be applying for any and all financial aid that I can find, which is making me think that a PA state school might be my best bet - but there are no state schools (or any colleges with CS programs) within hours of where I live... so moving seems inevitable, which opens up the option of moving out of state.

Okay, that seems enough info to start with - if there's anything that would help any of you point me in the right direction, please just ask. Again, my thanks for taking the time to read all this!

Extracurriculars:

- Elected Senior Class President on a technology-based platform. Lots of potential here for making a positive impact on lots of other people, and also shows that I’m not just some socially-awkward nerd.
- Self-taught programming since elementary school. I’ve used many different programming languages and technologies (HTML/CSS/JS (node), PHP, SQL, python, java, swift).

Internships:

- Local tech company (Summer 2015): 6 week paid internship, web development (Don’t want to get too detailed).
- Large tech company (Summer 2016 and 2017): 5/6 week paid internship. I was the only high school intern (and by far the youngest person at the company). Did actual programming (more web development), interesting experience in a very professional setting.

I got letters of rec from one math and one liberal arts teacher, maybe I’ll also get one from my internship manager or volunteer coordinator. I’m also having a hard time choosing east coast schools to apply to other than Harvard/MIT/Princeton, partly because I’d like to stay on the west coast. 

What are my chances at Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Harvard? Hopefully my passion for computer science will really make my application stand out. Any input is appreciated :)"

Hello, my name is MousyBrown. I’ve been out of college and in living in LA for 9 months, and, because I don’t know how to talk about this to any living soul, I am asking The Internet for advice on how to direct my life. 

Maybe this is a bad idea, asking other people for advice. I’ve spent most of my life following the directions of others and I think it’s led me to be aimless, helpless, and indecisive... but I am DESPERATE to talk. 

About Me: 
I was an actress from elementary school through college. Praised through elementary and high school, I got to college and found myself feeling inadequate. I was not cast frequently. I started feeling stiff and shy onstage. Though still occasionally praised for my work, I felt like a screwup. I truly loved performing, but depression set in. I decided that the stage was not for me, but I finished out my theater degree anyway. 

I took a few screenwriting classes during college. I loved writing at first, but when professors criticized my work, it crushed me. Still, I enjoyed it a lot deep down, and it made me giddy when it didn’t make me miserable. 

After college I decided-- Hey! You know what? I bet I could write children’s TV! I love children, I like writing cartoons, I can make this happen! So I got an internship at a children’s media company and moved to LA. 

Fast forward to now. Internship ended with no job prospects. Trying to get an assistant job ANYWHERE in the industry, and surprise, surprise: I’m not writing. 

About My Problem:
I’m afraid to write. I feel like my liberal arts education taught me little about the film industry. I don’t think I’m good enough. There’s always something else to do, so I’ve written very little. I’m so ashamed to admit this. The shame makes me depressed every morning. I feel so alone. I believe I’m an idiot who can’t string two words together. I cannot fathom how I could possible accomplish this goal. 

And I’m no stranger to this feeling! I’ve always been such a shy human with such a negative view of myself and the world. I never want to commit to a path. Shame, depression and honest belief that I’m inadequate have always stopped me from pursuing... much of anything. 

I wish I had some structure! I think about grad school a lot. I want guidance! Maybe this means I’m a fool and a coward because I can’t self-motivate. If you can’t self motivate, you’re destined to fail, right? Anyway, I wouldn’t spend the money on grad school unless I was SURE the cost would be worth it. Whatever I choose to study, it’d better pay off! That’s the smart way to think... I think... 

God. Sometimes I just want to give this whole thing up. I miss the stage, but that path is just as difficult. I taught theater classes during college and was very good at it, so maybe I could be a theater teacher? I’ve even thought about becoming a therapist, since I’m so obsessed with analyzing myself and friends. If I want to give up before I’ve even started writing, that means I shouldn’t do it, right? Right? I’m too weak, and I should try for a more conventional career. I’ve been a theater teacher, and I’ve worked with therapists. I know what those jobs look like. I don’t know what being a children’s tv writer looks like. 

At heart, I want to feel proud of myself. I want to feel like I’m accomplishing goals. I want to stop feeling ashamed of my life every day. I want to work towards something. Why can’t I decide what that something will be? 

This is a sappy-millennial-privilege-laden sob story, but it’s the only one I got. I needed to get it out and face it. Thanks for reading :)

I hope this will be an informative discussion. Firstly, I am Turkish citizen and currently a student at university in computer engineering department. 

Unlike most of countries, Turkey didn't give attention to computer industry. Turkey still have ""computer engineering"" departments instead of ""computer science"". Although the curriculum of engineering is based on computer science. Student profile is worst.-Also I need to mention that this is not only my opinion or observation, many people can agree about this situation.- Most of them are in university because they use social media or play games more than most of people. Some students have the ""I'm gonna hack the FBI or CIA or some Facebook accounts"" mentality. 95% have no coding experience. While the teachers makes us doubt they actually know what they are teaching. -For example if I want my programming languages teacher to explain why did we chose x function instead of y function, he replies : I do not know, I've learned that way-

So you can imagine how bad is this. I see myself as lucky because all of my family is in the software industry. My dad is an electronic and communication engineer, he used to work on first ADSL modems in our city and has lots of knowledge in network and later he started to web development. His cousin -I call him uncle btw- high school grade self-taught programmer and he is pretty good at his job (He went to few countries in Europe to work, came back home after 10 years). 2 of my cousins are software engineers, one of them is at Snapchat, other one is at Amazon. So I feel like I've got almost unlimited source and help.  My dad taught me HTML when I was 11. My uncle bought me PHP book, after that taught me the basics of C language. I learned 'a lot'. At least I thought I learned a lot. Everyone around my age, even some university student had no programming language knowledge like mine. As time pass by I realize that the things I know is so little, so little that it's not even enough to finish any project. Then I find myself on Reddit to dig up some information. I've been in some subs but people over there called me arrogant and some names but the thing is how could I knew that some kids in US or anywhere else can start learning programming when they are young and became programmer when they're 14-15? People in here almost have no opportunity start programming earlier than university. I started to learn as soon as possible and I'm still learning as much as I can. 

I just finished my first year in university. I'm looking for internships. In Turkey big companies tend to take students from top 5 universities because of their prestige. Other places takes you if you know someone who works there. Well I don't know anyone who works in a software company. I try my chance on international companies like Amazon but most of companies choose students from Schengen Area or US/Canada citizens. I'm well aware that these are just excuses but I feel lost for some time. I'm open to any advice.

Thank you all"

I was offered the job directly from the company rather than the temp agency and told that I would ""likely have a full-time offer by the 6-month mark"".


Great! Well, unfortunately, I am about a month in and I cannot get any quality work done due to a slew of ongoing problems. First off - I don't have a formal desk or work space. I've been placed ""temporarily"" in the chatty intern room with about 5 other people and more to come. Because of this, I am constantly mistaken for an intern - asked to do tasks unrelated to my team - and completely overlooked for important meetings and changing company knowledge. I fear that because I have been grouped in with the interns I am not being taken seriously and it is hurting my chances for full-time in the future. (also the interns do NOT stop talking - it's amazing! They can talk for 9 straight hours. How can one converse with another human for that long?)


I also do not have a quality working computer. I was given a (very used) company laptop that has had its hard-drive replaced more times than is healthy. It gets stuck on the welcome screen, randomly deletes files/drivers/applications, you name it - it's probably happening. Anyways - I've told my manager about my IT issues and because my work is centered around running heavy duty programs on my computer - it is making it impossible to do any work. He said he felt our company could do better but is now on vacation for 5 weeks. I might also mention that the interns have brand new MacBooks...... 


Bottom line:
🎶 I want to be the very best, like no one ever was, 🎶 but none of my equipment works and I do not have an adequate working space. I'm concerned this is negatively affecting my chance at full-time employment and do not know how to move forward in a corporate space.

6f2mow,26,2017-06-03,Need career/college advice (well paying job vs further education &amp; startup),achshar,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f2mow/need_careercollege_advice_well_paying_job_vs/,"Hey so I am a 24 y/o male techie grad from Chandigarh. I completed my BCA and now in the final semester of my MCA. Last sem was internship. It will be over in a month. I got an offer for continuing with 8.5 lakh/year (70k / month). I also have a startup. And I also want to continue for either a MTech from a good Chandigarh based University (PEC) (somewhat achievable with solid effort) or a masters/phd from a good US university (a *very* long shot).

I mostly have my mind set, but parents/relatives want me to take the offer and give up on the other stuff I have in mind. The money is not bad I must say. But I have almost 8 years of programming experience with actual work to show for it (no really, I know my shit) so I am not really worried about finding another job but it may not pay as well as the current company offer of 8.5 lakh/year. I can also see that my manager will be kinda fucked without me so he wants to keep me. I told the HR I wanted 10lakh. But I will decline even if they agree to that offer. (They started from 6 lakh, then to 8 then 8.5). The money will have to be life changing for me to accept it (&gt; 20 lakh) which is simple not possible in India for a college  fresher. Even though it's below the $40k that a below average software guy gets elsewhere in the world.

So I guess you can say that I am just looking for validation of my own opinion. And you can also call me a moron for rejecting the offer (I have to respond in a couple of days). What I am thinking is that I can get another job but I won't get this chance to go to a college again in my life. (I will already be ~2 years senior for average MTech admission next year).

So please either validate my opinion or call be an asshole for rejecting an offer that others might not get with even 5 years of work after college, just like all my friends/relatives and coworkers are doing ATM. Parents don't wan't to force me either way but I can see they want me to accept the offer. We are not well off but also are not dirt poor either (My new salary will be 1.5x what both my mom and dad make in a month. So we'll essentially be a lot well off than we are now). I will take the offer letter anyways so that I can re-apply in 6-8 months when/if nothing else pans out.

It's so tempting guys, I am fucked but also determined to do what I want. I may kick myself a year from now though."

Also still bitter that  I am getting the shorter end of everything because I go to school in the Bay Area and so they didn't provide me with housing (and I'm from LA, so it wasn't like I had family here to live with). I pay for parking and/or Caltrain. Meanwhile my co-interns are getting housing stipends and walk from their apartments. 

I was offered another internship with a startup yesterday as a data analysis intern. The work seems decent and it would be a shorter commute. I told them I was at X and they said they don't mind and can opt for part time instead. 

In the summer, I do have a full time course load, which I am bit nervous about. They're in two sessions, so they're half and half through the summer. Both are online pretty much, but I know I'm going to spend most nights studying when they're in session.

I also have to travel for some tech events where I'm speaking. This takes up a lot of time (full expenses paid, but I'm also not working). 

Last summer I was working 70 hours a week doing retail jobs with a full course. I was alright, but I also don't know what to expect this summer.

Does this summer for me seem manageable or am at risk of throwing myself off the Golden Gate Bridge?

My background/experience: I have a few projects up on GitHub and did a software engineering internship, along with two first year CS modules during my BSc.

I'm about to receive an offer from a HW startup (they haven't sent me the official offer letter yet), and I don't know exactly how much to expect for a starting salary. I do expect that the salary should probably be less compared to if I went to a well-established company, but by how much? Are SW engineer salaries at startups a good point of reference?

About me:

*MS ECE graduate in May this year from a top-20 school (PhD dropout)

*BS in ECE from the same top-20 school

*Prior internships in HW validation, embedded systems at Big Hardware Companies

About them:

*Located in Silicon Valley

*Roughly $10M series B funding

*Less than 5 years old

*No glassdoor page, unfortunately

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

I have about 7 months of industry experience from an internship that I took during my sophomore year, a bunch of cool projects, and a solid resume, but I just can't seem to get any calls from applications. If I do get a response it's usually just a message suggesting that they're looking for a candidate with more experience (which is kind of strange when I'm applying to entry-level jobs that require 0-3 years of experience.) I live near the silicon valley where tech jobs are plentiful, so I feel like this shouldn't be so difficult.

I'm a rising college Junior in my second summer as an intern for an FFRDC. I originally came about the position through connections with my Dad, who works as a contractor. My knowledge base was very lacking last summer, and I had at least one breakdowns, and a pretty bad case of impostor syndrome. My manager understood my lack of experience and tasked me with full-time documentation.

I was dealing with a lot of depression last fall, so I didn't reach out to pursue another internship. The company is trying hard to  drive interns into full time positions, so I was invited back again this summer. I'm working for the same project, an automation effort for spinning up environments for data analysis on AWS EC2. My task this year to spin up instances and write Test Kitchen suites for the Ansible playbooks that automate these tasks. Certainly this is new territory for me, as I don't have experience with scripting or environment setup, and a lesser knowledge of networking and security protocols. 

I'm somewhat embroiled in the same impostor syndrome as last Summer. The dev team on the project works remotely. We've never met personally, and it's hard to get in touch with them to ask the questions necessary. Many of them have assumed I'm more comfortable with the tech than what reality presents. They have end of  July deadlines to meet. I was in for two weeks to get acquainted, but struggled to get started on my task and never surpassed the setup and orientation of the tools involved. I'm now back at school for the month for a summer class, so I have a while before returning, but there was some thought/expectation that I'd be able to perform some testing remotely.

At this point, should I buckle down and just try to make it through the 4 or 6 weeks left once I return? I feel like I won't surmount my knowledge gap, and that self-study and personal projects my be better suited towards my advancement, and to that end I've considered quitting.  The pay is strong, and that causes quite a bit of guilt and remorse when I consider quitting.

I'm really trying to round the gaps in my knowledge and earn a intern spot in a solid company on the private side next year. How can I best achieve my goal, hopefully without an absurd degree of stress?"

I have a bad living situation so I want to work and save up as much as I can to move out. Right now I am just trying to calm myself down and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life and future. 

I was in school for computer science at a university that required full-time study and was not a good fit for me, and caused me extreme anxiety and depression during the years I have been there.

The only period where my anxiety wasn't so bad and I feel my mental state improve was a period of 8 months where I left school to work full-time but had left to retry school to get a degree to earn a higher salary. I am leaving with 11 classes left and 3.4 GPA. 

For me the education experience was really bad and really made me question the field and if it is a right fit. I guess right now all my ambition and drive feels really brought down. I realized that right now I just want to live simply on my own and after running some calculations I'll need about 14/15 an hour at full-time to eventually live on my own. 

I have an internship that pays around 17/hour but is temporary (ends after summer) and I do not know if my contract will be void if I have to tell them I left school. 

Am I screwed to be stuck at minimum wage jobs forever? Is there any field or line of work that I can pursue to support myself? 

I have programming experience in terms of Front-end and school projects and a portfolio on codepen and github and worked on webportal for a medical program for my school.

Dropped out of school for health reasons. Will not return at least not for full time study for a long time. I have some IT/CS projects and some experience, what kind of work should I pursue to support myself"

Here's my situation:

I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Wasn't sure if it was the right fit at the time and so (among many other reasons) I decided to join the Air Force. My job in the Air Force deals with radios/antennas and only tangentially relates to computers. I have 10 months left on my contract and am heavily leaning towards getting out.

I have zero job experience in the programming/CompSci world, and have not done any side-projects in my spare time (entirely my fault, but can't change the past at this point. I also feel completely inadequate every time I think about starting one: don't even know where to start). I'll also be 30 by the time I get out.

While I wasn't sure about programming/CompSci back in 2011, I am very intrigued by Data Science and/or Bioinformatics. I would like to pursue a Master's in one of those fields.

Reading subreddits like this one are terrifying to me. I feel completely intimidated starting over. I'm 30, zero experience, and my skills/knowledge from undergrad are rusty/gone. I'm also at a weird crossroads where a lot of internships are for undergrads, Master's programs expect a certain level of relevant ability, and jobs want experience or ability to explain concepts.

I am confident that I can learn quickly if given the chance, but the question becomes: what do I do to get back on the right path? What would you guys recommend? I feel way over my head..

Do I just apply to junior developer positions and pray they take the plunge on someone so inexperienced? Is that the best choice?
Should I apply for internships even if they are only for current undergrads? What about other internships?
Other options? Postbaccalaureate? Bootcamps? Coursera/codecademy.com/self-teach Python then go for Master's? Straight into a Master's? Can I even get accepted into a Master's program?
Or is there another method I don't know about to refresh my CompSci knowledge in order to get a job?

tl;dr: CompSci degree (mostly C++) in 2011, 6 years Air Force, zero work experience. Would like to work with Python doing Data Science/Bioinformatics. Best way to start down that path?

Thanks for any help and sorry if this is the wrong place for this question."

I'm particularly found of compiler design and free software, and I'm about to finish my master's degree.

The thing is that when I was 17 I had a *major* breakdown and I've been undergoing psychiatric treatment ever since (I'm 24 now). I've never been able to fully recover; also, due to the medication, I got a very strict bedtime routine, and really low stamina: I get real tired real easy.

Most my experience is with freelance jobs; I took an internship at a big company on Brazil to work at a compiler for their internal programming language a few years ago, to which I made a deal to work only five hours a day, and it was already exhausting. My boss seemed to really like my work, though. I've got good recommendations from him.

I've changed my medication last year (again), and I believe I'd be able to try working a full 8 hours now, but I'm still **really** afraid this might cause me problems, specially if the company needs overtime from me.

This is more like a systems engineer job.
My problem is, I don't really see any future in this. Based on my own feeling and on the feedback of others (trying not to sound big-headed here), I'm smart, who learns fast, and wants to learn new things and face new challenges. But what I do is just installing security-related tools, integrate them with other components of our IT infrastructure, and operate them until it is handed over the team who will be doing the daily operation. Provide escalations to them, and really rarely help with incident response/investigations.
I've chosen this job because I was really into security back then, but this ""deploy stuff based on the docs, start to work with it, troubleshoot it, call vendor support if you are stuck"" is not a big technical challenge - or not the type of technical tasks I would like to work on.
Sometimes, I have some scripting to do, which I really like, but this is just really simple scripting, to automate simple tasks. I'm actually good at this, but these are obviously not real developer tasks.
Back in time, when I've started this job, I've had other offers as well for various developer internships, but I've chosen this because I wanted to work with security. 
I have some friends who are working in similar roles, and I used to attend meetups with IT sec folks from other companies, call them security engineers or analysts or whatever, they are doing really similar daily tasks. I feel I could do more than this - let's face it: basically I'm just the user of softwares. 
Pentesting looks really interesting in the security industry, I'm reading lots of stuff on this in my freetime, but, here comes the ""but""-part: I'm getting a really good salary now, much better than other companies are offering for pentesting roles in my area. As I think my current background is only sufficent for a really junior pentester role (because of lack of technical stuff what I've described above), financially this would be a big step backwards.
My other idea was going for a dev job - but I would start here as a junior again. I think I have a potential for this as well, I have a solid understanding of programming concepts, but my actual experience is ... not much.

Any advice? Or this will get better eventually? "

They assigned me a task before I would be offered an interview:

&gt;1. Install RhoMobile and set up a free account.  Using the very thorough online documentation, familiarize yourself enough with the basic workings of the platform to create and try out the basic demo app called Storemanager they provide in the tutorials.

&gt;2. Install the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and familiarize yourself with its basic operation.  

&gt;3. Build the sample demo app using RhoMobile. Edit the code so that your name is displayed on the app's opening page. 

&gt;4. Install the modified demo app on your Android phone or tablet and run it there.

&gt;5. Email me a screenshot of the modified app running on your device.

I managed to get through the first three steps with no issues, but ran into some trouble at step 4:

&gt;&gt;I don't know if it defeats the purpose of the exercise for me to ask for anything more than clarification, but I'm having an awful time figuring out how to build the app to prepare it for installation on an Android device. I've been banging my head against a wall for the past three days at [this step of the process](http://docs.rhomobile.com/en/5.4/guide/build_android#building-an-android-production-version). Any build command I run that doesn't go through RhoSimulator gets me this error:

&gt;&gt; [copy and pasted error message from PowerShell]

&gt;&gt;As far as I can tell from online forums, there's some issue with a file called ""android-support-v4.jar"" needs to be in the right directory, but I've been at this for the last six hours and I have to wonder if I can just ask you if you know how to fix this.

I also completed the same task in Android Studio and sent him a screenshot of it running on my device since I figured that might demonstrate my capacity to at least enable developer mode on a phone and USB debugging:

&gt;&gt;I don't know if this will satisfy the purpose of the assignment, but I have figured out how to run an app onto a phone using the Android IDE. Unfortunately Android IDE can't read the file types that RhoMobile uses, so I can't simply copy/paste Storemanager into an Android IDE project, but if the purpose of this task was to assure that I can enable developer mode and USB debugging on an Android phone, I believe this demonstrates that skill. I've also gone ahead and put my name in the app like you had me do with Storemanager. 

&gt;&gt;[attached screencap]

At this point I didn't hear back from him for four days. He responded with this:

&gt;I'm not going to be much help with this, I'm afraid.  I've had to put my programming projects on hold over the past year because of ramped up job responsibilities, so I haven't yet used the latest versions of Rho or Android on my machines.  For what it's worth, another student ​applicant was able to build successfully, so there clearly is some way out of the maze!

#

&gt;&gt;I've missed the May 31 deadline by now. Would you like me to keep trying to figure out the Rhomobile approach?

#

&gt;Glad you've been making progress with this.  As we'll be working exclusively with RhoMobile apps, we need to be able to upload and test them on real Android devices.  Have you worked out a way to do this yet?  If you'd like to continue working on it and need a bit more time, that would be fine.  Needless to say, RhoMobile is a useful tool to be acquainted with if you're serious about building up your app development skills.

#

&gt;&gt;I haven't been working on it since I was hoping you might be able to push me in the right direction with that build error. I can continue to try to figure it out for myself tonight if that's necessary before we move on to the next step, but I don't believe it would take much longer than five minutes of troubleshooting with someone who is familiar with developing in Rhomobile for Android on Windows 10 for me to be brought up to speed.

Again, at this point he didn't respond for another three days. Just this morning he finally responded:

&gt;You're probably right.  As these projects have been on a back burner for some time, though, I don't have anyone right now, unfortunately, who is able to provide the needed nudge.

At this point I'm getting the message that in order to get an interview for an internship position at their company, i.e. an opportunity to learn from them, I must first complete a task that nobody at their company knows how to complete. I've also gathered from my several hours of googling that RhoMobile hasn't been used by anyone since 2013, which leads me to assume that ""these projects have been on a back burner for some time"" means it's been at least four years, and none of the people who were going to work on those projects work there any more.

Does this sound like the kind of company I should even be trying to pursue? Because I'm afraid I'll get there as an undergrad intern and they'll expect me to be completing projects with an obsolete dev platform all on my own which would be more appropriate for a whole team of experienced software engineers."

tl;dr: Graduated with a Liberal Arts in Game Design degree. 3 years of C# in Unity3D experience. Flown to Cali for an interview, given literally 0 code tests. After telling what I've made in C#, I was constantly told ""OK, but what else?"". I'm stumped what they mean and where I can improve.

---

Alright, so some backstory: I graduated a month ago with a Bachelor of Arts in Game Design. For the last four years I've pushed myself on the scripting side. I've worked on 3, year-long, full games in various game engines, such as Unity3D and custom engines written from scratch by engineering students, using LUA, C#, JavaScript and Python for them. This doesn't include the 10+ prototypes I created from scratch through graduation, majoritively using Unity3D / C#. I also had an internship with a company, Treyarch, and used their proprietary game engine and scripting, learning more about delegates and threading, learning slowly about that since.

Alright, the interview: I was flown to Cali for a designer position interview. The design test went well, but I felt I was hung up when one interviewer began grilling me on my coding experience. Not once, ever, including the pre-interview, the phone interview, or the live interview did they EVER ask me for any code tests or such. Yet, one guy asked what I had done with code. I explained the various game engines I've used, my internship, the countless projects and prototypes I've worked on.

He stopped me and said ""OK, but what else?"" I was a bit confused, so I discussed the iterative and recursive pathfinding I self-taught and used in a full game project. I discussed the AI management system I wrote in Unity controlling their InfoNode pathfinding. I discussed the velocity-based player controllers I've written. I discussed any small thing I could thing of, such as HUD's, menus, smooth-lerping object positioning, anything. Not impressed.

He said once again ""OK sure, but again, what else have you done with C#?""

I had absolutely no idea what this guy was asking for of me and I was quite confused. Later on I wish I would have asked him for what he meant.

Does anyone have any ideas on what he might have meant? What I should go learn and teach myself? I'm not an engineer but I've never fretted over teaching myself new techniques or languages. I've been learning a bit of C++, but I'm only about a month into learning the basics.

Should I look around, should I bring it up again or are my expectations out of whack. I do the same work as other people in the org but I know that I make less and it just bothers me a little. I'm also pretty confident in my interviewing, is my best bet to look for another offer?

I do like my job and would prefer to stay there for what it's worth but I'll make a move for a higher salary."

Looking for some feedback on my profile and target schools. Applying for Fall 2018 start.
Thanks!

**Work Experience**
Currently - 1 year at a large bank (think PNC, Capital One, Bank of America) as a senior engineer working on big data and machine learning projects. My responsibilities include that which you'd probably associate with an engineering manager (recruiting, technical direction, project management). Based on reviews, expecting to be promoted to manager within the next 3 months.

Previously - 2 years as a software engineer a mid-size S&amp;P 500 tech company. Started as a graduate intern and offered full time position shortly after starting. Primarily focused on big data engineering.

Before that - 2 years at a small regional (frankly, no-name) web development shop.

**Education**
B.S., Computer Science (3.2 GPA) from a state school in the #40-60 range for the major.
M.S., Computer Science (3.6 GPA) from a state school, again in the #40-60 range.

**Extra Curriculars**
Member of cybersecurity clubs in undergrad and grad.

**Age/Gender/Race**
30 year-old male asian

**GMAT**
740 (41V/50Q/6AWA/7IR)

**Goal of MBA**
Looking to make the move into product management or accelerated leadership at a large tech company. I think the combination of technical expertise and a formal business education will give me the necessary skills to bring products to market on-budget and on schedule. 

**Target Schools**
Wharton, Booth, Sloan, Haas, Columbia

Thanks for your feedback!

What should I do?",BeachChicken,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6fb3o7/somebody_has_offered_to_help_me_pay_for_things/,"Preface: I am a rising senior in college, have an internship, but haven't gotten my paychecks yet. Even when I do start getting paychecks, I am worried about how I am going to buy my own food, pay for gas, and pay for other daily occurrences while saving for life after right after college. My parents are divorced, and I don't get along with one of my parents, and I would really like to live on my own immediately after college. It would be healthy for both of us. I was living with the other parent, but they decided to move and only got enough rooms for both of my other brothers, meaning I was left out (very abruptly told me before I came home from one year in college I didn't have a place to stay anymore). I had to then move in with the other parent and it's been a real wreck. We don't get along at all.

The issue is, the parent I live with barely makes money. Not even enough to support themselves (yet they won't do anything about it, even though they have a degree). They have a close friend (I think close friend? -- I swear they are dating but she won't tell me anything). They approached me today and said if I ever need help paying for gas/groceries/necessities I should feel comfortable to ask for cash.

It's a very attractive offer, and it's very generous. I could really use some help paying for my food/gas as I commute to work a long distance every morning and burn through gas and food that I bring to work. 

I really don't know what to do. Yes, I need that cash and it would really help me, but I just don't know if I am comfortable to go ask somebody that isn't in my family for cash. Not only does it make me a little embarrassed, but it just feels wrong.

Should I just accept that I need financial help or do you think I should figure this out on my own?"

So why do these IT positions often ask for computer science majors when we indeed(at least me) know next to nothing about systems and security?

They are happy with my work and would like to increase my pay (200%) raise to 60k + stock options.
in these 60k, I won't have to pay FICA, so it would be 48k after taxes

I feel that it is very low for SF, and even US. As I checked on glassdoor.

Should I negotiate? Some people tells me it is a joke to propose this salary in SF.

I'm a computer science major, recently completed my first year, and a few months ago I made a big decision which was to quit my job, since working warehouse full time (overnight), while also attending school full time as a computer science major became too much.

These few months have given me time to think about my next move in terms of jobs. I had enough money saved up for a few months, so now that the semester is over, it's time to start looking for my next venture.

1.)
So my question, as the title suggest is when is the right time to apply for an intern? I see there's some interns that say ""must be pursuing a bachelors degree with at least one year completed"". I just don't know what type of experience they expect which keeps me from applying to some of these listings. 

What I've learned so far is loops, arrays(2-dimensional), vectors, pointers, functions, structures, classes, files, binaries, and next semester I'll be learning more about sorts, searches, binary trees etc. I'm gonna assume that me knowing just that means I haven't learned ish lol.  

2.)
So my next question is, what do interns expect of you? If they say, ""at least one year"" what exactly does that mean? What would be a task fitting for someone that has done only one year? 

3.)
P.s Off topic, but where did you work while in college? Basically ""What were, or are some good places to work part time as a computer science major?"". Or should we settle for restaurants, retail, call center, type jobs until we're a few years more in?

I am a recent graduate and graduated from a business school last fall (2016). 

I did an internship in a large conglomerate as a business developer in group management. The team I developed a completely new product that was to be implemented in the different divisions. When I finished the internship the product was finished around 90%. The rest of the work would be completed once the first client is to be signed.

After having completed the internship my boss at that time was very happy with me and fought to keep me in the company. I accepted a great offer where I became the executive assistant for one of the divisional executives.  

The current position has been created for me and I am very thankful for this. Both my former boss and my current boss like the work I deliver. I do of course some minor mistakes but all in all I live up to my expectations. 
The role is however slightly different, during the internship I only did business development for this one product that was to be implemented throughout the company, compared to today where I sit on several projects for my executives division. 

Funny enough, my executive is not a great fan of the product I have been developing in my prior position, because he claims his market is not ready for the product. Following his claim he never put his division in scope for this product. It becomes funny when the single largest client for this product, located in his market, knocks on his door wants the product. 

My executive has a product and a potential client, however he does not believe in the product. This results in the fact that he puts the work related to product on hold every 2 weeks. I strongly believe that he is not willing to sign the client due to the associated risk of it. 
•	It is a completely new product and this might bring unknown risks. 
•	The last 10% of the product to make it fit to the client would require an investment and it seems he does not want to take it due to the risk. 

I am sitting also in a weird political workplace situation. I like my former boss and current executive. However they don’t like each other. It is tough not “be on one side” all the time.

I bought the Cracking the Coding Interview book and did Leetcode questions thanks to all the suggestions here. So, thanks a lot for the tips.

**Background:**
I just graduated this year (Apr 2017) from a random university in Canada in the middle of nowhere (not UofT, UW, etc.).

I went to this conference in Montreal and met this company from San Francisco. It turned out that I knew someone working there already who I met at the same conference the previous year. So, I asked him to refer me, did some interviews, on-site, etc. and got the offer. So, I'm starting there in a couple of weeks which is all very exciting.


However, I can't help but feel that I only got the job because I knew my friend there and was talking to the company representatives at the conference earlier in the year. My university is not well known, my personal projects are very trivial, and  I only had 1 internship before in which I barely did anything. My parents are both immigrants who could not go to university, so I had to work in our shop most of the summers.

Everyone at this company come from amazing universities and all the new grads starting there this year are from Stanford, Caltech, Princeton, Yale, etc. Obviously, my knowledge will not be at the same level as these guys, but I don't want to be discounted as the nepotistic hire.

So, how do I make it in Silicon Valley if I'm not a rockstar from Stanford??? I feel like I know nothing and everyone else is going to be hammering out code in seconds while I struggle.

6ffv05,1,2017-06-05,Year without full-time position after graduation. Would it be possible to get some advice?,cscqtw1037,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ffv05/year_without_fulltime_position_after_graduation/,"Forgive me for the length:


  I’m currently jobless and am having a difficult time getting a full-time position. I graduated from a no-name college a year ago with decent-ish (3.7) GPA with a B.S. in Computer Science. Since then I’ve had an internship where I didn’t actually do much, which was followed by some training at a consultation company where I was subsequently let go for poor performance during a mock interview exam. This was the only point where they cut out employees - afterwards they make us sign a contract for the real position after the end of training and a successful interview with one of their partner companies. I believe that my layoff was mostly due to my anxiety and poor social skills (I’m awkward). 


  I don’t have a lot of side projects outside of school and didn’t have any internships during school, which also hurts my job prospects. I feel that I should have done so much more while I was in school and knowing that hurts a bit. This isn’t a great excuse, but didn’t do much because I thought it’d be better to learn as much as I can in classes before devoting large amounts of time to side projects and internships. This was a big mistake as I realized later on that you only need to know the basics before you can start doing side projects, internships, and independent learning without much trouble. I could have started after my first year of college and I didn’t. I was also pretty fucking stupid in not doing research about breaking into the industry. I would have learned that true entry level positions are very difficult to obtain and I should have put effort into getting one out of college, but I just assumed that I could at least obtain *some* kind of position if I graduated with a decent GPA and nothing else.  Again, I’m a fucking idiot. 


  I’m not super passionate like a lot of the guys here and I have issues with my self-esteem. I don’t think I can even fake the enthusiasm that is sought after in this industry – especially those people who spend *all* of their free time programming. I enjoy programming and I definitely want to learn and improve, but it’s hard to dedicate large amounts of time to practicing when I feel like it may be fruitless in the end. It’s also pretty hard because I’m pretty indecisive on what to learn and how I should go about learning it. I feel that there are many things I should be learning that they are pulling me in different directions and whenever I try to learn something, I worry that I am wasting my time or not using it wisely and should be putting my efforts in another direction. 


  I haven’t done much for a few months other than doing some leetcode and hackerrank questions and applying for jobs every few days. It might sound stupid, but I have a hard time even getting myself to apply to jobs due to how I feel about my situation. I also live in a remote area where the tech industry is small (Hawaii), which is another barrier to getting interviews. It’s been a year since I’ve graduated so I’m in a bad position. I really want any kind of advice you guys can give me. It’s been so discouraging lately and I haven’t been able to find the motivation to do much. If anyone can give me any ideas about where I should put my efforts and how I can go about it, I would very much appreciate it. [Resume.](http://imgur.com/PbgGus0)


TL;DR – I was stupid. No job for year after graduation. After graduation did internship that didn't involve doing much followed by small amounts of training in consultation company, but was not hired. Not much side projects out of school and no internships during school. Live in area without much opportunity for jobs (Hawaii). I haven’t done much for months. I would like any kind of advice about what I should do and how to direct my efforts if possible.

6ffzo1,12,2017-06-05,The Night Drummer,ahilgen,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ffzo1/the_night_drummer/,"When you lie down to sleep, head resting gently on the cool pillow, do you ever listen to the gentle *thrum thrum thrum* in your ear or do you ignore it? As a child I would get startled by it, swearing that it was growing louder and more insistent. A powerful giant lumbering closer and closer but yet unseen. Only when I lifted my head from the pillow to seek out the danger would it disappear, its cover blown, and retreat until another night when maybe it could catch me unawares. 

Age and common sense pushed such silly thoughts away. It is, after all, only our own heartbeats that we are hearing. The panic of something unknown coming to get us sets our heart going which only heightens the fear. Silliness. But what if I told you it wasn’t *just* our heartbeat? What if I told you that there is something you could learn from that dull, rhythmic thump?

When I was nine I fell out of a tree while trying to race a friend to the top. My right leg took the brunt of the force from the fall and shattered in three places. I was in a cast for months and although it healed completely I have had issues with it ever since. It is my early warning system for bad weather, the reason I have to go an extra twenty minutes to the airport for security, and why I need to stretch each morning and each evening to prevent lock-ups. Even though it is healed it will get really stiff if I don’t stretch it out really well, especially when it is cold or if I have been working hard.

It was during that long, slow recovery time that I overcame my fear of the heartbeat. With a lot of time spent in bed reading and watching television I would hear that thumping often. Eventually I learned that I could control it, making it speed up by taking short quick breathes or slow down with long and steady deep breathes. 

Over the years such things fade away and we forget all about them. They become routine, mundane, and we no longer pay them any mind. A decade after my broken leg I was a freshman at university and doing what freshman do best – party. On this particular occasion I was befriending a bottle of McCormick 360 and attempting to woo a lovely young thing by the name of Becca. The wooing was unsuccessful but the alcohol poisoning was not. I had to be rushed to the hospital where I was pumped, attached to an IV, and eventually released after a long night of sleep. 

During my stay there as I lay on an uncomfortable bed I closed my eyes and listened to my heartbeat. It was different. I know it was different because I had listened to it for months, memorizing the patterns, the stutters and lurches, the muffled wet *thrum thrum thrum* that made my ear itch if I listened too closely. It sounded weaker now, less distinct. I chalked it up to the weakened state that I was in and pushed it out of my mind.

I wish I had learned my lesson from that night. I wish I had eased back, taken it slow, been responsible. The next few years of my life were a whirlwind of drinking and finals. How I made it through I will never know, let alone manage decent grades or a decent internship. Connections certainly helped. The old “it isn’t what you know but who you know” is pretty damned accurate. From that internship I built a solid career in advertising – using my skills from college to drink my clients into contracts. It was fun, we had a blast. But then I needed a liver transplant at the old age of 33. 

Again, I was lucky. A family member died and donated their liver to me – not that I deserved it. I should have been thrown to the back of the list and left to rot out my final days with a bottle of Sambuca. Again I had time to lay and ponder my heartbeat, and again it sounded different. Weaker, softer, skipping a beat even though I could feel my chest thump where the beat should have been. It freaked me out, set me sober. I cleaned up my act, changed professions, and swore off alcohol. I was clean and I was happy. I found a lovely woman who somehow tolerates my harsh laugh and soft belly. 

Life has been good since then. Almost two decades of sobriety and happiness. Our daughter turns nine years old tomorrow so of course I banned her from climbing any trees. But that isn’t why I am writing this to you. I am writing because this morning I woke up with a stiffer than usual leg. I lay in bed massaging it out to get ready for the day when I realized I couldn’t hear my heartbeat. I pressed my head deeper into my pillow, turning my head one way and the next with no reward. I can feel it thumping rapidly in my chest. I can feel it speed up and slow down with my breathing. When I place my hands on my chest I can feel the steady rhythm against my palms. 

Maybe we don’t hear our heartbeats like we think we do. Maybe we are hearing something else. Maybe I am the only one or maybe it is all of us. What I do know is that it slowed with each major injury in my life but only *after* it had happened….

I recently just finished my time at community college, and will be headed to a university in a bigger city. I have mainly only been working with C++ in school so far.

The town I am in does not have internship opportunities (at least I couldn't find any) for CS majors. I have been out of school for a few weeks and I am going crazy because I feel like I need to be building something. I have no idea what to build though. Everything I have done so far is just compiled in visual studio, with only text based interaction (no UI). I'd like to take what I've learned and be able to build something that a user can really interact with.

This also brings me to a point where I don't really know what I want to do with my CS degree. I originally wanted to get into web development, but after spending a few years grinding away at math, physics, and these CS classes, I feel like I want to do something more ""sciency"". If that even makes sense. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for personal projects that might be good for me? 

Also, any career advice would be wonderful. There's just so many different directions I can go. It often feels overwhelming.

I want to improve my skills and start building something on the side once I have everything settling down with university. 

So now I got two jobs, and... it is a helluva hard work deciding which would be best. I have the option of going to an about 40 employee startup, where I would be a ui/ux designer, or to a 350+ employee IT company as a marketing analyst (people there would be older than me, and I would have the possibility to get higher relatively faster, as the department is new). Both opportunities seem really good, which makes me maximally confused - the analytical/more creative work would help best in preparing for the future? I believe that the startup would be better network-wise, are my beliefs true? 

If you had the choice of working to get some more experience/income (assuming both options have the same salaries) would you want to go to a bigger corporate company or a startup?"

Now in the past 1.5 years I took classes to be a registered nurse and worked as a nursing assistant but due to injuries sustained on the job and the experience of being a nursing assistant in general made me reevaluate my goal..

I have a 3.99 GPA. I did running start (community college during high school) and earned an associates degree with a DTA, meaning the credits directly transfer to Washington State universities. The only issue is that I have 3 college transcripts, which includes my running start college transcript. Will I look to fickle to universities and would they possibly reject me? 

Also, the only course relevant for prerequisites to apply for the CompSci majors I have taken is Calc I, which I received a 3.8 in. Depending on which majors I would apply to I may need to take anywhere ranging from 3 to 4 more courses (Calc II and two programming courses) to potentially more courses to apply for the majors.

I was looking at UW Bothell's Computer Science and Software Engineering degree, UW Tacoma's Computer Science and Systems degree, and WSU's computer science degree. Is anyone aware of how competitive these programs are for admissions, how good these programs are for getting jobs, and advice on how to make myself a good applicant (by extracurriculars, activties, internships, jobs, volunteer etc)?

I'm that backpack guy, you know the one who always has a backpack on his back everywhere they go.

They end up cluttered with the various items I carry on a daily basis from sliding gloves(longboarding) to laptops. I've spent some time researching, but the options are limitless and reviews aren't proving very fruitful. So I figured I'd ask the people with a use case similar to mine.

**Requirements:**

* Multiple Main compartments(Not just one large compartment)
* Durable(I'm super hard on everything I own)
* Holds various items well(Gloves, tools, cables) 
* 2 straps(Not a fan of the messenger bag) 
* Travels well [generally don't use luggage when flying, just 2 backpacks(one containing clothes etc and one containing Laptop, etc) and I'm good to go]

**Preferences:**

* Branding is minimal(optional but a major plus)
* Prefer a warranty
* Water Bottle Repository(Like my hands free)
* Organization Structure(not a big deal, I can build my own)

I'd love to read what this community has to say about this. 

Edit: I don't need to keep my board attached, I will be riding it most of the time.

6fhvtk,1,2017-06-05,HS Student asked to bring private code to paid internship,PickledHS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6fhvtk/hs_student_asked_to_bring_private_code_to_paid/,"Heya reddit,

Basically, I'm in a bit of a pickle. A few months ago, I met some people and we submitted a CS project to a hackathon (HS, current sophomore). One of the sponsors offered a prize of a paid summer internship. It pays $16/hr and I would really like the money. DC Metro area.

After the hackathon concluded, my team and I continued working on the project independently. We have written up a business plan and talked to various experts in the industry. We've planned it out, and we envision going to the summer internship for a few hours, and after work is finished, going to a library/public place and using our own laptops to code the program. That way, none of the work is done on company time/company dime, and the company that employs us should have no claim to our code. We've looked into the hackathon code of conduct (MLH) and they state that we own any code we have written during the hackathon. Thus, the company does not already own anything that we have written, I believe. Is this correct?

Anyway, one of my team members visited the site recently and told the squad that we are expected to work on a continuation of our hackathon project while working at the internship. On the one hand, this shouldn't be too bad because our vision and code has already changed significantly since the hackathon concluded. However, again, we do not want to give our code away. I've talked to several experts and our idea could net a good deal of money in the long run. We've found a niche and done market research.

Wat do? I think that the best course of action would be to inform the company that we have already written some code on our own that we would not like to give away to them for free; thus, we could work out an arrangement for something else to work on. However, I signed the contract that stated that I was an ""at-will"" employee; don't want to get fired over this either. 

Do most people work out agreements like this? I'm new to this and don't really know what to do. Any help is appreciated."

Basically realized my depression living at home with parents and barely making it through high school, started college in 2013, earned my AA in arts degree, at the time I was trying to focus on school but enjoy life and try and move out away from parents to have my own life, ended up about 4k in debt from having to borrow student loans after receiving a layoff, took a year off school after I earned my AA to work and earn some money, got numerous more layoffs during the year due to unreliable job choices and bad living situation back with the parents, to make it short, my parents were renting from someone who had to sell the house because of a family emergency. 

Unfortunate luck, my dad was experiencing work shortage during this time, been living in a motel for about a year now. earned enough to buy a used car after being laid off from the second job, continued doing temp work as it seemed to be the most decent money methods I could come across as an undergraduate. Haven't spoken much with parents these recent few years I prefer to keep to myself. Started smoking weed for a little over a year just to make things feel a little better.

Finally got fed up with layoffs after being reassigned positions at a data entry job to a warehouse employee where i'd just be used for physical labor and no benefits id qualify for unless the company hired me on. Not willing to risk that chance, I quit that job and immediately went to my college to reapply for the bachelors program in software development in school. I had a large interest in computers for a long time and felt this was something I would enjoy and I truly did starting out. 

Because I earned an AA, I would be accepted into the program after a quarter of prerequisites, these were challenging but not too difficult that I couldn't pass utilizing proper tutoring. First quarter into the bachelor went decent for the most part, passed an intro to web dev and java programming course and had to take a technical writing course which I also passed. Current quarter has been the most challenging taking data structures &amp; algorithms and a full stack web dev class, been seeing tutors constantly and had to take on a full time job because my car was starting to give out and I had little income from a part time job. This dramatically cut my study time and i've had to result in copying homework from classmates to pass certain assignments.

Lately i've just felt like I won't make it through senior year at this point with all that's going on, But I'm so close only having one year left. I've been consistently polishing my resume and applying for internships to put myself out there, landed a few interviews this year but didn't do well on the white boarding for the one I made past the initial screening.This living situation has dropped my confidence considerably, not landed the position for that internship hurt, had a rough previous year before returning and ended a relationship with a close friend after she rejected me for coming onto her, she now has a boyfriend and we haven't spoke for almost this entire year. 

My midterm exam in data structures was trash and I've been constantly attempting extra credit opportunities to boost my grade, full stack i'm sitting on a passing grade, that's about it. I also have two group project finals coming up due in two weeks. At this point I feel like things just aren't getting better anytime soon."

(Sorry for any grammatical mistakes. English isn't my first language.)

A little background info: 
I am a rising college sophomore in a pretty well known university in the U.S. I have pretty good grades, took a bunch of intro cs classes, got an internship this summer. I didn't grow up near programmers, nor did I have any real world experiences in the industry.

Here is my problem: 
A group of speakers from a startup came and talked to my undergrad research team today. IMO they were very rude.(Some of them arrived late, they interrupted us a lot when we were asking questions, they straight up ignored our Professor a few times.) I talked to some of my close friends who were there, and everyone(except for one person) thought it was normal for people in the industry to act a little rude/snobby because they are confident about what they know. 
I was a little sad about it because I knew I didn't want to work with people like that. But I don't want to give up on pursuing my dream career because I simply don't like a small group of people in the industry. Also it will be hard for me to explain to my parents why I decide to give up a pretty good trajectory for a silly reason like this. I am kind of hoping that my friends were wrong about this. 

I guess my question is: 
Is there a high percentage of people in the industry like that? If so what's your advice for me? What can I do that's also somewhat programming related? Or should I just learn to deal with that instead ?

I've read lots of good insight here, so I figured I would ask a question that I've been considering myself lately. The situation is this:

I am currently enrolled in the Master's of Computer Science program at DePaul, attending full-time. I have a non-CS-related Bachelor's degree, and I am just finishing up my second quarter of classes (DS/A I and Systems I). I am also working a full time job as an IT helpdesk specialist, where I have exposure to a few items that may be relevant to me at a later date (SQL/database stuff), but no real hand in any development work.

My question is, as a Master's degree student, does it make sense to seek an internship offer as soon as possible, or should I wait a few more quarters before applying? One thing I am worried about is that, if I do find an internship, it will only last a few months before I need to seek another job. Are there more permanent internships in the Chicago area? 

Will IT helpdesk experience look better or worse on a resume than an internship? 

My goal is to become a software engineer of some kind, but I am just getting my feet wet for the first time and don't really know what kind of tech I'd like to work with. 

Any insight you can offer would be most appreciated, whether you've been in a similar situation before or not. Thank you for reading! :)"

Need some outside perspectives,SShanging,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6fm25e/new_community_college_bachelors_program_yes_or_no/,"I dropped out of high school 5 years ago. I'm 23 now, and I'm looking to go back to school. My family moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area 2 years ago from Seattle.

My original plan was to simply live with my parents, attend the local community college, and transfer to the local University, which is UT-Dallas. The issue is I really, really do not enjoy living here.

My plan now is to move back to Seattle, and attend Bellevue College for 4 years, for their new Bachelor's program of computer science.

My family has a house in Seattle, though it is currently rented out for another year. In the meantime, I will live very cheaply at my friend's house, about $300 a month. I will be paying out of state tuition, and with some ballpark math, it'll cost me around $55,000.

Staying in D-FW, the cost of local CC will be in state tuition price, much cheaper, but once I transfer to UT-Dallas, the price will go up a lot. I haven't done the math, but even with state residency price, the 4 years of college (2 CC, 2 Uni) in D-FW, I'm guessing, will only be slightly less than going to Bellevue college.

Why would I want to move back to Seattle by myself, pay out of state tuition price for a local community college Bachelor's degree? Because I truly do not see myself living in D-FW in the long-term at all. With Seattle's healthy tech growth, even if I attended “only” a community college, and spent 3x the price of an in state resident student for my degree, I say it's worth it, because with the higher salaries in Seattle, I could pay off my loans faster than with a job here in D-FW. I could follow my plan here in D-FW, and then move back to Seattle after graduation, but I want to do my internships in Seattle, because I think it'll help with securing a job locally, once I'm out of school. Also, the aspect of not wanting to live in anymore.

Looking for some perspective on my plan. Thank you.

6fngqz,13,2017-06-06,Into the Abyss,SebastianWInter,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6fngqz/into_the_abyss/,"Water is covering most of the Earth’s surface. Everyone knows that. The ocean is enormous and mighty, it provides people with abundant resources, but not everyone knows that 95 percent of the ocean is unexplored. People usually are surprised to learn this information. For this reason, ocean always had fascinated me. In a way I was even glad it is like that because it gave me a unique opportunity to explore and research places and things that no one had seen before me.  That is why I chose to dedicate my life to oceanology.

When I came to my internship in college, I got lucky and was hired to go on an expedition. The expedition went to explore the Kermadec trench. This trench is the fifth deepest in the world, at least of the known ones, and reaches 32,963 feet in the deepest part. It stretches 620 miles in length. Logically, such a huge place is almost unexplored. 

The expedition was trying to save on the finances, so they chose me as a man who would pilot the bathyscaphe and immerse in the trench. I had to take samples from the ocean bottom. I clearly remember all the preparatory processes of the expedition – selecting the research ship, bathyscaph, crew recruiting and countless small details that were absolutely necessary. And then the day of diving had come.

A day of diving back then was cold and inclement, strong winds were blowing, and standing on the board had been unpleasant. I was worried that the diving wouldn’t be possible because of the bad weather, but in the end forecast had promised no wind in an hour. I remember that when I got inside the “Jolly Roger” ambient wind sounds had become much more silent. After all, passenger area hull was made of 3 inch thick, high-strength steel. Then I had closed the entrance hatch and was sensing how ship crane lowered me into the ocean. Through the small porthole I had been watching as air bubbles that were trapped in the winding metal constructions finally got out in freedom and swept to the surface. Already a few meters below the surface all the sounds had completely subsided, and the sense of absolute tranquility occurred.

Soon it had become completely dark, and I had turned on the powerful LED lights to see the surrounding ocean. “I’m reaching 2000 feet,” I remember me announcing this over the radio. Now it seems to me that at that moment something had happened to my memory because after that I can’t remember events clearly. In my memory, my own voice sounds distant and strange. It sounds as if it belonged to someone else. Not long ago I blamed this on the fact that the abyss had affected me with its greatness, but I don’t believe that anymore. All the following events in my memory are hazy and unclear too. I remember that I successfully reached 32 316 feet depth, collected some rock samples and ascended to the surface. I am incapable of remembering smaller details. Such as, underwater creatures, topography of the ocean bottom and my conversations with the ship through the radio. In my head there is only one grainy picture – lurid, gray ocean bottom illuminated by the LED lights.

2 months after the expedition, I had a dream. Very disturbing one. That kind of a dream which you remember for all your life. In my dream I am inside the bathyscaphe again. I’ve reached the ocean floor, and I am trying to palpate something in the sands with the robotic arm. In this dream there are two more men with me. One of them is talking over the radio, but I haven’t touched the radio at all. “We have reached the bottom – 32 316 feet,” I hear my colleague announcing. Failing to palpate what I was looking for in the sand, I use another device to clean up the place so I can see how to maneuver. Once the place is cleared, I see in the camera screen that the strange object is the hatch handle decorated with  a variety of forgings. I beckon my colleagues to look at it. We can’t believe our eyes. Then one of us comes up with an idea that it is a camera glitch, and we decide to look at the mysterious object through the porthole with our own eyes. We change the position of bathyscaphe so we can see this object, and it really looks like a hatch with an elaborated handle. Besides that it shines in mystic purple tone which is much different from the rest of the ocean bottom. Following events in my dream are the most horrific and incredible.

Hatch suddenly opens and very bright yellow light is streaming from it. We all for a moment become blind, because our eyes are accustomed to twilight which prevails in the bathyscaphe. However, I notice the black shadows surging out of the hatch. When we recover from our blindness, all ocean bottom is illuminated by a bright light. Everything is clearly visible as we were on the surface. I discover that the whole ocean floor is covered with the same purple metal hatches, but open is only that one we have poked and nudged. Then the fear of death seizes all three of us because on the bathyscaphe ceiling a red light appears. It looks just like a laser, and it is easily cutting our sphere. I hear how my colleagues are screaming. Radio operator shouts in the handset, “SOS! SOS!” but it seems that radio isn’t working anymore. Then happens the strangest thing. I loose control over my body and I am unable to move. I can see that my buddies have the same problem. Next we see that the hull has been cut, and I am thinking about death under the powerful press. However, water doesn’t start to flow inside. I see that strange creature removes the cut metal piece and looks inside our cabin. Other creatures are visible besides that one. Beings are out there – in the water, but we are still in our places, and the water isn’t flowing inside.

Creatures are best described as a mermaids, but they are not the ones from the folklore. They are larger than us – people. Their bodies throughout have similar color as humans because their fish tails aren’t covered with scales. Beings have unusually long, smooth fingers. Their faces recall a human face, but the nose and mouth are proportionately smaller than human’s. Most horrific are the eyes of the creatures, they have no resemblance to humans. Eyes are completely black. There are neither the pupil nor iris – whole eye is pitch black. However, beings have some common features with mythical mermaids. They all have long hair and breasts.

The very next moment I am frightened by new terrifying events. One of the beings stretches its arms, seizes one of my mates and pulls him out of the bathyscaphe into the ocean. Helpless person is still petrified and keeps his sitting posture while taken out of his place. Then another creature goes after my second mate and also pulls him out. I see how his name tag glides along my eyes and I can clearly read – K. Gerald. When the first two creatures have disappeared with their victims God knows where, a third one is peering along the edge inside the bathyscaphe. It looks like it wants to stretch its hands and grab me, but she is hesitating. Her face has stuck in my memory the best from this awful nightmare. Blond hair, slowly fluttering in the water, small mouth, tiny, slender nose and eyes like black holes. Finally, mermaid stretches her slender index finger and makes a gesture as if to touch my forehead. Physical contact doesn’t occur, however, when she does it, a thousand bells start to ring and chime in my head. Then I wake up.

After that night, I hadn’t had this dream anymore, but I couldn’t forget it. It seemed to me that black eyes of the being were still watching me. Then I decided to investigate research results to prove myself that it was only my vivid imagination, and nothing supernatural had happened. I took the research file and began to thumb through it. I hadn’t found anything peculiar there. All results had been completely normal. However, when I was closing the file, I accidentally opened the first page, which described the general things. Such as expedition ship, submarine and crew member names that I knew by heart. And then I had frozen in horror. In the documents clearly was written K. Gerald – radio operator, ocean biologist and third “Jolly Roger” crew member. I had remembered the name tag from my dream instantly. I immediately called the organizer of the expedition, although the clock already had shown half past eleven in the evening. “Hello,” sleepy voice had answered. “Hello, Mr. Smith! Lucas is calling there. You remember, two months ago I participated in your expedition to the Kermadec trench.” “I recalled your voice, but what do you want from me in the middle of the night?” “I have a question about the submarine crew. Why did I descend in the trench alone? The submarine has three places! And why the file contains other submarine crew members?” I had asked emphatically. “But we had talked about it! To get more funding, we invented false crew. What are you pointing at, Lucas? Do you want to blackmail me? You won’t succeed…” I hadn’t been listening to him any longer. I had tried to remember the conversation about finances, but I failed to do that. In my memory there was no such conversation. “Hey, are you still there?” I heard him say. When I didn’t reply, he put down the handset. I remember that by then I had already a better idea what to do.

The next day, early in the morning, I arrived at the port, where the expedition ship was still docking with “Jolly Roger” on board. Finances for expeditions were difficult to collect, so research vessels often were idling in the ports. The captain, with whom we were good friends, was here and let me on board. I immediately went to investigate the bathyscaphe. I circled around it and tried to look for some unusual stuff, but couldn’t find anything. Then I climbed up to the crane, which was about bathyscaphe roof height. From there I jumped over to the bathyscaphe. I had had a clear action plan. I was looking for the place where in my dream the red laser had cut the hull. I had knelt down and started to examine bathyscaphe roof inch by inch. And there it had been. A small ripple in paint. It could have been just a tiny painting defect, and no one would have found it, but I knew, it wasn’t just a simple painting defect. No defect is forming a perfect circle…

Tomorrow I will look for some simple office [job](https://sebastianwinterwriter.tumblr.com/)…"

3 April 1829
 
Another man caught the Fever, this time down at the lumber camp. From what I hear the poor bastard was tyin’ down the logs when he just up an’ fell right over into the river. Almost drowned, I heard, and when the others got to him, Matthew and Thomas and the lot, they said his face had gone pale as a cloud, and that he was shakin,’ and sweatin’ and coughin.’ Ain’t no mistakin’ that for nothin’ but the early signs o’ the Fever. So they hauled the poor fellow out and gave him a canteen and had him rest, but then without tellin’ him, they struck camp an’ left ‘im there. I'm not sure what came of him. But everyone here knows the Mayor’s rule - none struck with Fever are permitted to return to Andersonsburg. If they're favored enough to survive the thing, unlikely as that sounds, they're to remain banished to the woods with nothin’ but the clothes on their backs and whatever coin they gots in their purse. Not a one of the other lads down at the camp wanted to risk becomin’ an Infected and meetin’ such a grisly fate. No, sir.
 
---
 
4 April, 1829
 
By mayor’s decree: the lumber camp is to be abandoned, along with all the supplies it's gathered, for fear of bein’ tainted with Fever. There was an uproar at the Mansion today over the decision. Many men are out of work now because of it; but strange enough, I didn’t see not a one of the fellows from the camp itself down at the Mansion; just their wives and some others. An’ I know why, too. They wouldn’t admit it aloud - no, sir - but they don’t wanna go back. I wouldn’t either. I've seen the Fever at work at Pinefield, and it ain't got no place in my home. Not while I got a wife at home. No, sir.

7 April 1829
 
Maria says to me today in the kitchen: “Paul, I can’t believe the Mayor’d throw so many good men out of jobs!” But I says back to’er: “Dunno, Sweetheart. Perhaps he’s got himself a point. That ol’ camp’s been run clean over with Fever. An’ you don’t want that Plague findin’ its way round here, no, sir. God ‘Imself couldnt’ stop it if it did.” So she snorts and walks away. But she’ll come ‘round eventually. ‘Specially when the stories of the Infected keep comin.’ 
 
If Fever’s hit the camp, then its only a good two or three miles from town. Only a matter of time, I think, before it finds its way here. God above, I hope I’m wrong, but maybe I should start thinkin’ bout takin’ Maria away for a time, though, to see my brother in Philadelphia. Just til all the foul things conclude here.

11 April, 1829
 
A man got shot last night, not a hundred yards from Jim Isley’s porch. Jim says he was delirious, just stumblin’ about near the treeline without an aim in the world. He calls out to ‘im an he says, “Declare yourself! You’s an Iroquois? I’ll shoot you dead if you an Iroquois, ol’ boy!” And he said nothin,’ so shoot ‘im he did. Then Jim sent his boy Nathan into town to fetch a picket while he watched the field, thinkin’ an Indian attack was brewin.’ But when Nathan got back with some of the men an’ their rifles lookin’ for a good fight, not another Indian had shown his face. So they went out and looked at the body, and saw it was somethin’ worse: that old Infected fellow from the lumber camp. Found his way back to town in his stupor, and by God, says the men, the Fever worked its way through him right quick. Says he was rottin’ inside-out, skin fallin’ off like a Leper. Teeth all filed into those wicked points. So they puts up their shirts to their noses and mouths and they set the body to the flame. 
 
They told the story today at the Pub, but some o’ the other gents there took offense to the tale. Says they shoulda told the Mayor, says they shouldn’ta gone near the corpses. One fellow, Tom Huggins, I think he was, said those men were probably Infected, too, by virtue of goin’ near even a dead Infected. Says the Plague lingers after death. Then he bolts out the door, and the barkeep asks the storytellers to leave. I left, too. Ain’t no riskin’ gettin’ the Fever. No, sir.

15 April, 1829.
 
Jim Isley didn’t show up at the Office today. An’ all the men there knows the story with the Infected fellow gettin’ shot, too. So the rumors are swirlin.’ No one’s heard from him. His clients are stoppin’ on by and alls we can say is ‘we ain’t seen the fellow, come on by later on.’ So they do, but they ain’t happy about it. No, sir. I like ol’ Jim, even if he’s a little small-brained, so I says to myself *I think I’ll stop on by his house after closin,’ to see what’s the matter.* I know I shouldn’t, but if he’s sick I’ll know for sure and I won’t go near the man. 
 
I just hope it ain’t the Fever. God above, I hope it ain’t the Fever.

So I gets to his house at roundabout dusk and his wife Sarah opens up the door. She’s a sweetheart, she is, but even though she’s puttin’ on a nice big smile for her guest I can tells she’s got a worry on her mind. So I put my hat to my chest an I says, “Greetings, ma’am. Just stoppin’ on by to extend my regards to Jim. He didn’t show up at the Office today, y’see, and I was hopin’ I could see him.” Then her smile fades and she says “That’s mighty kind of you, Paul, but Jim’s been under the weather an’ he won’t let neither me nor Nathan in the bedroom. Alls I know is he’s sweatin’ and havin’ trouble keepin’ down a meal.” Then *my* smile fades, an I says without a second thought, “Sarah, I’m guessin’ you heard bout the guest a half-week back? The man Jim shot?” An’ she says, “The Iroquois scout! Jim says he shot ‘im dead.” So *I* says, “Sarah, that weren’t no Iroquois scout. That was the Infected feller from the Lumber camp. Jim an’ some other fellers burned the body once they saw the skin.” An’ her face goes white as a ghost an’ she just says “Don’t you lie to me! Don’t you lie to me about my Jim!” An’ she goes an’ shuts the door in my face! I hope she gets her wits about her an’ gets Nathan out of there soon. He’s a good lad, and she’s got a big kindly heart herself. They don’t deserve this. As luck would have it, though, I ran across Doctor Armistead on the way home, an I tells him about Jim. Maybe he can help.

16 April, 1829.
 
Maria wakes me up earlier to-day an’ she says, “The Isley’s are gone! The Isley’s are gone!” An’ I’m tired so at first I don’t know what nonsense she’s talkin.’ But then I remember Jim an’ Sarah an’ Nathan, an’ I says, “What you mean, gone? Dead, gone?” An’ she says, “No! The Doctor says Jim’s got the Fever, Paul, and so a few men grabbed their muskets and they haul the whole Isley family out their house and toss ‘em right out the whole town! Some of the men says, if they ever come back, they’ll shoot ‘em dead.” 
 
So I feels right guilty for rattin’ ‘em out and I throws my covers off an’ I run outside an’ down the street. Sure enough, the Isley home’s gone up in a smoke! The whole towns out there watchin’ it burn without a pity, except the Parish, and when I run up I hears people talkin’ about anyone else who’d been in contact with that body of the fellow down at the Lumber camp. Then I hears the other names come up: David Brody, John Greene, Will Benson Hodges. The townsfolk say they’ve gotta find ‘em an give ‘em the boot, or else the whole town’ll get the Fever! One lass says “Why don’t we just shoot ‘em?” An another fellow says back to her, “Then we’d have to remove the corpse. Wouldn’t wanna go near such a thing, would you? *The Plague lingers.* Better to have ‘em walk right on out on their own two feet.” 
 
But I thinks to myself *hell, that's almost worse.*
 
---
 
18 April 1829. 
 
The town’s all done over in a hysteria, I tell ya. The Mayor’s declared martial law ever since the Isley’s and the Brody’s and the Greenes and the Hodges got evicted, and not a soul is to enter Andersonsburg until further notice. You can leave an’ he won’t stop ya. But you ain’t comin’ back if you do, and the townsfolk’ll assume your departure means you been struck with Plague. Then they’ll burn your home to ash. I’ve seen it happen ten times in the last few days alone. These boys ain’t playin games, no, sir. There are some o’ them religious folks talkin’ about how its God’s judgment for sin, and other fellows with muskets patrolin’ the streets, and every once in awhile you’ll hear a big ol’ loud *crack!* as he pops off his gun. 
 
Cause that’s the other thing, y’see. Them Infected keep tryin’ to get back in.

20 April 1829. 
 
Some o’ the Infected stormed in down Mulberry Street last night. Stole some cattle, rattled some doorknobs. But the militia showed up right quick an’ drove ‘em off with some sharp musketry. They didn’t kill any of ‘em until after they’d run out past the wooden palisades. Then they shot ‘em in the back an’ dropped ‘em like a sack o’ potatoes, says they. 
 
The men have orders only to wound, if possible, y’see, if the Infected make it inside the town. That’s seein’ as how a dead Infected in the streets is a corpse some poor bastard’ll have to remove. And then he’s struck with Fever too, far as the town’s concerned, and they send him a packin.’ Needless to say not a man woman or child in Andersonsburg's willing to volunteer for such a job. So the Mayor says to the militia captain, he says, “If them infected find their way in here, you get ‘em out some way other than killin ‘em dead, y’hear? I ain’t aimin’ to have to pick a poor lad to take the bodies out and take himself out the same way. No, sir.” 
 
---
 
24 April 1829.
 
The Mayor let in a visitor today. Some o’ the townsfolk down at the Hall threw up a good fit over that, but the man had somethin’ to say, so in he comes. He meets with the Mayor an’ from what I heard from Phil Gables, he told the Mayor the Infected have thrown in their numbers and overrun the nearest town over west. That place - Lesterburg - was in a similar spot to us: rootin’ out the Infected, burnin’ their homes. Barricades had gone up, the milita’d been mobilized. All the same, the Infected, hungry for flesh, swept in out of the woods one night and overran the barricades and the watch towers an’ killed every last person in the town. ‘Cept for this feller - Charles Gates or somethin’ or other - he was the last man alive, an’ he ran all the way here to tell us that horde is headin’ up this way, not two days out. 
 
So now the town’s gotta figure out what’s to be done. Some people think the feller’s lyin’ to get himself a bite to eat. Others think we should all leave for Philadelphia while the leavin’s good. Others think we can take on the horde. Lesterburg was half the size of Andersonsburg, after all, says they. We have more men, more muskets. We could beat ‘em. But its all up to the Mayor now.

25 April 1829
 
The Mayor elected to stand and fight, but said that anyone who sought to flee was welcome to do so, o‘course. Got himself a nice round of applause, and then the men, myself among ‘em, set about collectin’ arms and bullets an’ buildin’ up the barricades in the streets and settin’ up wood towers for the lookouts. If these Infected aim to have a fight, a fight they shall have. 
 
Accordin’ to Charles, we should expect the horde to come up from the Southwest near the Pike, sometime in the next twelve or so hours. Said there were uncountable hundreds of ‘em, all rottin’ away and thirsty for blood and crawlin’ like beasts. We’ve got ourselves a good two hundred forty men and muskets and rounds enough for maybe a hundred eighty of ‘em. Add to that number thirty good sharp-shootin’ rifles for the marksmen in the towers, and even two twelve-pounders overlookin’ the pike from two angles, and we gots ourselves a fine force to defend the town with. But I can see it in everyone’s eyes: a mist of fear. 
 
Tonight I’ll spend the evening with Maria, and we’ll do what the two of us can to take our mind off things. By the door is my musket, o’course, and in my satchel all the ammunition I could find. Should I hear the church bells go off at any point, I’ll have no choice but to grab the gun, kiss Maria one last time, perhaps, and rush out to the Southwest barricade to do some fightin.’ 
 
If the church bells ring a second time, though, everyone knows what that means: the Infected have broken on through. Then it's time to hit the road to Philadelphia. So I tells Maria to keep our valuables packed.

26 April 1829
 
To-day I took a good stroll out at the edge of town. We’ve got ourselves a good palisade. Some of the boys at the Northwestern edge even dug themselves a trench, and the whole of the militia, even Captain Gaines, have elected ol’ Booker Downes to lead the defense, seein’ as he fought with the mountaineers in the Indian wars an’ got himself some experience. So he rounds up some horses and dispatches a rider to Philadelphia to call up some help, and then two more riders with orders to scout the outskirts of town - one to the west to spot the horde an’ the other elsewhere to ensure they ain't comin’ up from nowhere’s else - and report back what they find no later than mid-afternoon. So off they all go, and the rest of the lads get back to the job of fixin’ up defenses. 
 
---
 
By now we scrounged up a good twelve more muskets and forty or so pistols and every blade we can find. The butcher was kind enough to lend us some cutlery, and in the town armory Briggs and I bagged up a few score rusty bayonets and distributed them evenly along the front. We got ourselves an army now, boys. I only hope it lasts the night. 
 
---
 
Still no word from the scouts. Downes is gettin’ nervous, so he goes an’ he sends off another two riders and says “You lads go no more than a mile out, y’hear? Then come on back to me.” So off they go. 
 
---
 
One of the new scouts came a-gallopin’ on back in, and he's huffin’ an’ puffin’ an’ he says to Downes, “They ain't just comin’ up from the west, sir. Spotted a good lot of ‘em in the Northwest, too, and the north, an’ they gots themselves horses! A whole mess of ‘em!” An’ Downes says “Whatd’ya mean, horses? Like they’s eaten ‘em?” And the scout says, “no sir, they’s *ridin’* ‘em. Like cavalry. Dead lookin’ things, rottin’ skin, with the same red eyes as those Infected folk. An’ they makin’ speed, sir! They makin’ damn good speed!” 
 
An’ no sooner does he say that then the Church bell rings. And I look up, and all the men looks up, and we see young Johnny Billings up there, and he’s waving his arms and shouting somethin fierce and pointing off to the West. So we looks to the west. And there they are, all’ve sudden, a whole mess o’ them Infected comin up out of the treeline and runnin up the hill towards the barricade. So we all rush up to the wall and take aim, and Downes says to fire the twelve pounders. So they fire - *BOOM! BOOM!* - and a good few of those Infected go’s a-flying. But then more are coming, and more and more. 
 
So then the marksmen open up fire from the towers an’ they're pickin’ the bastards off as best they can. But the horde gets closer an’ closer. Soon they's in musket range, so me an’ the boys fire a volley, an’ when we reload the boys behind us fire, and then the boys behind them. We three lines deep at the choke-points. An’ pretty soon we got Infected pilin’ up right quick not fifty yards off. Dead an’ more dead an’ more. But the rest of ‘em keep right on climbin’ over the pile o’ the dead ones and keep right on a-comin,’ an’ we keep right on shootin.’ 
 
But then the infected did somethin’ I ain’t seen yet. Far as I could tell beforehand, the Fever keeps you from thinkin’ straight, an’ then you’re just not thinkin’ at all; you just a mindless thing with rotten skin that eats and kills. But today, after a good ten or twelve minutes of fightin,’ the horde got up and the whole lot of ‘em actually *fell back.* Now that says to me a number o’things, things discussed openly as the men set about reloadin’ and fetcin’ water in the interim - that means these things are *thinkin.’* They knew they couldn’t break our lines an’ so they retreated back towards the trees. They ain’t done - we can still see their damned red eyes glowin’ through the shroud of trees, but they fell back. Maybe they’s scared? 
 
---
 
The Infected haven’t tried another all out assault yet. Commander Downes thinks they’s waitin’ for nightfall so they can slip in unseen, so he had a handful of boys from each of the regiments head out to the killin’ fields an’ throw up lamps while some others stood guard. When sunlight starts to fall we’ll have other boys run out with torches an’ light those lamps, an’ the hope is we can keep the fields lit for shootin’ throughout the night. We gots’ closer lamps, too, that can be lit from behind the barricade without havin’ to send men out all exposed. 
 
--- 
 
Sun’s comin’ on down. We can still see them damn Infected in the trees, an’ we hear rustlin’ an’ footsteps an’ Commander Downes says they’s likely to be bringin’ up reinforcements for another push. Billie’s got a fine ear, an’ he says he can even hear ‘em talkin,’ out there. Gruntin’ an’ stuff. Probably plannin’ their next move.  Meanwhile the boys on this side of the palisades have been reinforcin’ the barriers. 
 
Still no word from the other three scouts. But we ain’t holdin’ our breath on their return. 
 
---
 
Round about eight o’clock we heard some shootin’ at the Northwest barrier, so Commander Downes sends me an’ Butler an’ Payton out to see if they need help. So we get there an’ the boys said the things had tried crawlin through the tall grass for cover an’ were only about a hundred some-odd feet from the palisade when the boys spotted ‘em an’ started shootin.’ So we goes back to Downes an tells him, an’ he calls up a Council of War with the regiment heads an’ says that given that an’ the retreat from earlier, its clear the Infected are smarter than we thought. Made a point to say that no weapons could fall into their hands. Not under any circumstances. No, sir. 
 
No we all’s still waitin’ on that big night-time push. 
 
---
 
Sure enough as hell, those Infected bastards made a second big charge against all the barricades at the same time, sometime before midnight. Damn near caught us with our pants ‘round the ankles, too. We hear rifle cracks from the marksmens’ towers and then the twelve-pounders fire off, and then a flurry of musket fire from the Northwest. Then they hit us twice as hard as they did before, and we’re firin’ volley after volley into ‘em, stacked up three lines deep to keep the musketballs flyin.’ An’ they’re hittin’ the dirt an bits an’ pieces of ‘em are flyin,’ but still they keep on comin.’ 
 
Then they start hittin’ back, even though they’re still a good fifty yards to the palisade. They bring up rocks an’ start flingin’ ‘em towards us. Fistfulls of gravel flyin’ in through the musket smoke, an’ they pepperin’ the boys an’ knockin’ teeth loose. Men start to yelp when they get hit. An’ them twelve-pounders are firin’ away, too - *BOOM! BOOM!* - every couple o’minutes, an’ that tears big groups of ‘em down. But they kept on comin’ till they was right up at the palisade, an’ Commander Downes told the front row to start up with their bayonets and blades an’ tomahawks. I remember how close the bastards came to takin’ a big ol’ bite outta my neck. Luckily ol’ Bruce knicked the sumbitch with a bayonet to the head an’ he keeled over. Not long after that the Infected retreated again. 
 
But now we gots a fresh problem: we got casualties. Men are bit, men made contact with Plague, an’ so now we gots to do what we all knew we’d have to do. Get rid of the infected. Commander Downes rides up an’ he takes a good, long look at this one poor lad, arm bleedin’ from a bite, an’ he tells ‘im to head out an’ relight the torches. The boy looked all forlorn, like he knew what was happenin,’ but he weren’t about to disobey orders. So out he goes, an’ as soon as he lights the torch, Downes has one of the men fire on the poor lad. He dropped like a stone, dead ‘fore he hit the ground. That one hurt us all, I think. 
 
But we wasn’t done, neither. Some o’ the other men got touched by Fever, too, an’ so me an’ the rest o’ the boys backs up an’ levels some pistols at ‘em and we asks Commander Downes, “What do we do with ‘em, sir?” An he says, “You know what we do. We send ‘em away.” So at gun point we show the men to the gate, an’ they’re beggin’ an’ they’re pleadin,’ but we gots no choice. So out they go, an’ we say we’ll fire at ‘em unless they get as far away from town as they can. We all knew what was comin,’ an’ sure enough as soon as they got near the woods, Infected ran out an’ dragged ‘em in. We all watched ‘till the screamin’ stopped an’ the bushes quit their shakin.’ Few o’ the men here got sick. Others cried. I just wrote it all down. God above, I hope Maria’s as far from this hell as possible.

27 April, 1829.
 
We slept in shifts last night, and luckily there weren’t any other attempts by the Infected to rush the barricades. But we’re tired, the lot of us. Damn hell, we’re tired. I’d be amazed if any man got a lick of real rest. We was silent, but we stayed up an’ we listened good to the sound of Infected howlin’ out there in the woods. There were thousands of ‘em, it sounded like, fillin’ up the whole night sky with the din o’ their big, collective war-scream. Lasted for an hour, maybe more. 
 
One o’ the boys nearest me was prayin’ along all night, beggin’ for the good Lord to come down an’ save us. I asked him to put in a good word for me, too. 
 
---
 
This mornin’ some of the wives pitched in with medical aid an’ a big, hearty breakfast. So we ate well, an’ Commander Downes allowed us to spend time with our families. Maria an’ I took a nice stroll, but I didn’t have much to say. By mid-day I was back at the palisade with the other men, and by sun-down we were startin’ to hear the Infected gettin’ riled up again, hearin’ that awful *howlin.’* 
 
Downes an’ his aides were ridin’ back an’ forth, makin’ sure the walls were good an’ solid, the cannons reloaded and manned, an’ the belltower watch was keepin’ his eye out. An’ this time we gots’ some o’ the younger boys to run ammo up an’ down where its neede-
 
Shootin’ started. Will update if possible.
 
---
 
God above. God help us. The Infected hit us at all sides, all at once. Them cannon’s were firin’ like mad, an’ Commander Downes was tellin’ ‘em, “Aim for the trees! Aim for the trees!” So they did, an’ after a few rounds they’d managed to dam off the entry points an’ slow down the horde. But it weren’t more than’ a stopgap. Them Infected were runnin’ through the musket smoke, howlin’ an’ screamin’ for food. Some of ‘em were gallopin’ towards the walls on all fours an’ you could see the red of their eyes, like poolin’ blood. Jim Isley was one of ‘em, an’ I had to be the poor bastard to put ‘im down for good. I’m sorry, Jim. Truly, I am. 
 
But they kept right on comin!’ The boys were firin’ wildly and choppin’ an’ stabbin’ an’ screamin,’ and them Infected was doin’ the same an’ tryin’ to mount the palisades. An’ then, just when there weren’t a lick more we could take, we heard some o’ the men screamin’ from down *south* of us. We wasn’t aware we were even threatened there, but sure ‘nuff, them Infected bastards had broken on through some of the pickets an’ were tryin’ to break in through the windows o’ the houses. So Commander Downes sent me an’ five other gents to go an’ put a stop to that. We burst in through the houses an’ stabbed ‘em through the windows an’ traded shots for rocks over barrels. I got all good an’ cut up from the explodin’ glass windows, but I ain’t been bit. Not yet. 
 
So we put a stop to them comin’ in that way, but when I got back I explained to Downes real good that they were gonna try that again, sooner or later, an’ we needed a good force o’men to guard up there. Turns out he’d gotten similar reports from other parts o’ town, though, an’ so we’d have to stretch our lines real thin to cover it all up. But we did what we had to, an’ by God we held the line all around the town by the skin of our teeth. Some o’ the men - God above - grown men, they’re just cryin.’ They’re so damn tired, an’ scared. We all are. But we held the line - by God we did. Ain’t a man here who didn’t do his duty.

28-29 April, 1829.
 
To-day the women an’ children helped us all build a new defensive line to-wards the center of town. Downes says that if we get hit again like we did last night, we’d have these new palisades an’ trenches to fall back on. I worked with Maria to-day diggin’ away. She tended to my wounds, too, an’ we just enjoyed each other’s company as we worked. I even got some shut-eye, some *real* good shut-eye, if not but for an hour or two. Then it was sun-down again. The boys an’ I ate up a stew the women cooked up, an’ then we were off to the palisades. 
 
Them wooden posts were beaten an’ worn, too. We knew we couldn’t stay for long. An’ as soon as the Howlin’ started from the trees, Commander Downes ordered the twelve pounders be stripped an’ rushed to the inner line of defense so they’d be ready if it gets bad. Or when it gets bad, I suppose I’ll say. 
 
I made sure to kiss Maria real good tonight, an’ made her *promise* to make a good run for it if those church bells rang twice - which now meant the inner line’d been breached. She cried an’ nodded. I wanted to tell her that if she had to run, I’d meet her at Joseph’s house in Philadelphia. But alls I could bring myself to say aloud was, “You run straight for Joesph’s, you hear? Don’t you stop.” ‘Cause Lord, an’ I’m tearin’ up just writin’ this down, I don’t know if I’ll last the night. 
 
Hell, I dunno if anyone here’ll last the night. 
 
---
 
We at the inner line of defense now. We ain’t been hit that hard since the battle started. God above, it was a bloody mess - the rush started off with some Infected leapin’ outta them woods an’ tacklin’ the lamps into the ground. The glass broke an’ all the dry weeds go in a flame. Soon the fire smoke an’ the musket smoke made it so we couldn’t see a damn thing out there; all’s we could hear were the *howlin’!* Musta been a thousand o’ the bastards tonight. Maybe more. 
 
So we’d been shootin’ for a good while, an’ hackin’ an’ throwin’ rocks, an then we heard the commotion up at the other wall, an’ boy we *knew* it weren’t no small thing. There were men screamin’ an’ the shootin’ altogether stopped up there. So we knew they were done for, an’ Commander Downes rides up to us an’ he says, “The Northwest Palisade is breached! Fall back to the inner line! Fall back!” An’ so me an’ the boys pick up our guns an’ beat a fightin’ retreat down the Boulevard towards the inner walls. Then them Infected started pourin’ over the palisades, an’ we knew there weren’t no throwin’ ‘em back. Not this time. 
 
So we get’s back to the inner palisade an’ we start right up again, shootin’ an’ firin’ those twelve pounders, boy, an’ them Infected are comin’ at us from e’ry side now. Howlin’ the whole way, burnin’ up an’ gettin’ shot all up but still runnin’ at us. Now we gots *kids* in the camp, an’ I can hear the lil’ lads n’ lasses puttin’ up a good cry even o’er the din o’ the fight, an I thinks, *how’s it we ain’t sent them lil’ ones off to Philadelphia? How’s they still here?* Maybe its ‘cause Downes thinks their presence will inspire us, y’know, to fight even harder. 
 
Anyways. After ‘bout a good more hour or two o’ shootin’ an’ stabbin,’ the horde dwindles a bit, an’ that’s when Briggs see’s it - one o’ them Infected mounted up on a dead horse, lookin’ down on the town from atop the wooded hill north o’town. We only saw his silhouette an’ those red eyes peerin’ at us through all the smoke n’ flame, but he’s there, right as rain. Briggs points an’ we all look, an’ we gotta catch our breath in our throats. Them Infected got themselves a general, from the looks’ve it. He’s just sittin’ up there, watchin’ his Plague-runners set the town ablaze.
 
Not too long after that some sunlight comes up o’er the church tower, an’ then the horde falls back. But we don’t know how far; we don’t know if they’s ran back to the trees, or if they’s still inside the town, stayin’ in our houses til’ dark. Downes says we can’t spare a-nobody to go an’ takes a look. So here we stay, here in the inner palisade by the edge of town. An’ we waits for nightfall. An’ that Infected up on the horse.

29 April, 1829
 
So I got’s some sleep this afternoon. Not a whole hell of a lot, but a better amount than none. First thing I did when I woke was help count ammo. We’s almost clean out; maybe ten rounds a man, an’ now we’s only got seventy men or so. An’ them twelve pounders is almost out, too. They only has maybe twelve balls left to shoot between the two of ‘em. An’ none o’ the riders’ve gotten back, neither, so we ain’t got no reinforcements comin.’ 
 
So Briggs an’ I, an’ Payton an’ Short, we goes up to Commander Downes n’ we says, “Sir, we almost out of men n’ ammo, an’ we got lil’ ones here, sir, an’ our wives! An’ the town’s all up in flames, sir. There ain’t nothin’ left for us here. Not for a one of us. We should make a run for Philadelphia while we still gots’ daylight.” But he says back, “I ain’t never left the enemy in command of the field. We stay, and we fight.” An’ he rides off! Now I ain’t no mutineer - Lord above knows I done my duty - but I ain’t aimin’ to die for the principle of it. Not when I gots my Maria here, an’ no town left to defend. 
 
So I talks to some o’ the men an’ women and lay it out for ‘em. An’ I says, “Look here, boys. We ain’t lastin’ another night an’ if we do, what’ll come of us in the next one? We gots to get out while we still can. The road to Philadelphia’s still open, an’ we still gots ourselves enough daylight to get outta the woods an’ to the open road before nightfall.” An the majority of ‘em nod an’ we take a vote. The motion to leave is the clear winner. 
 
So we get our things an’ we tells Commander Downes, “We’s leavin,’ sir. There ain’t nothin’ here left for us an’ we ain’t aimin’ to die for a pile o’ rubble.” An he gets red in the face an’ he says back, “I’ll have the lot o’ you *hanged* for treason!” An’ he calls up his boys - bout half the men left with their muskets an’ he says, “you lot arrest them mutineers, y’hear?” An’ so they advance, an’ we level our muskets to repel ‘em back. But before any shots are fired, one of the women in the Church points down the road headin’ off to the Southeast an’ she says, “Look! One o’ the scout’s is ridin’ in!” So we all turns an look an’ sure enough, ol’ David Benjamin’s pulin’ up into town, an he looks like hell itself. 
 
He says, “Water, water!” An’ so we gives him a canteen, an’ then he says, “I was comin’ up with a column o’ state militia from the midland, alls the help I could muster up, but them Infecteds - they’re everywhere! All over the road, out in force. I swears they was lyin’ in wait for the lot of us, like an ambush, an’ they leapt down on the main road an’ just tore into the poor lads. They didn’t have a chance. I’m the only man who made it back; I needs to tells y’all that the road to Philadelphia is blocked!” 
 
So now the whole damn town’s in a panic. We’s surrounded by the Plague, an’ there ain’t no way out. An’ not a minute ago, while I was writin’ this here entry, someone points up to the hill north o’town an they says, “There’s the horseman!” An’ we all look an’ there he is - that Plague Rider, eyein’ the town with that wicked red stare o’his, an’ that of his horse, and we see’s he’s got a whole wretched host o’ other Infected Riders. An’ then they started movin’ right on down the mountain towards us. 
 
Then the Howlin’ started, and just now - the church bells started to ring. I know it in my bones I ain’t survivin’ this night. They comin’ at us from all sides now. An’ I’m holdin’ Maria tight, an’ she’s cryin,’ too, an’ alls we can hear’s the wailin’ of the lil’ ones from the church, an’ the shouts o’ the boys as they run up to the Palisade with their guns, an’ the wheelin forward’ o’ the cannon. So I gave Maria a kiss, an’ I’m leavin’ this here diary in her possession. I love you, darlin.’ I love you, an’ I hope you know that.

29 April, 1829
 
Paul has gone off to the palisades. He’s scared. I am too. We all are, but we’ve gotta be strong for the children here in the back of the church. The other women and I have tended to the lot of them since the men fell back to the inner line of defense, which I helped to build, and at least half of them have the Fever. Of that I’m now sure. But it no longer matters, does it? They won’t live to see themselves be taken by it, and perhaps that’s a merciful thing. 
 
---
 
The shooting has started. The boys are throwing in everything they’ve got, God bless the lot of them - but I can tell its not enough. We’ve but an hour left, maybe less - before the Infected make it to the church. The children here have cried themselves empty, and now they're huddling around myself and the other women and clutching our dresses and burying their faces in our laps. I’m as afraid as any of them. But I can’t let them see that. I can’t. 
 
---
 
The church bells are ringing again, and the men just outside - the thirty or so of them left (I’ve no idea if Paul is among them) - sound exhausted and panicked. The cannons have long since stopped firing, likely having expended their ammunition. Only periodically do I hear a musket blast. Paul was explaining earlier that they’d nearly run out of bullets last night. I can’t imagine they’ve found many more.  
 
---
 
I hear galloping now, coming up from the west. Its not the state militia. Its that Plague Rider. I can hear him - I know its him. I know it. He commands these beasts. He grunts and shouts, and they listen. They’re only a few yards from the Church doors. We’ve hidden the children in the very furthest corner and covered them up with whatever we can find. We told them to stay quiet, at all costs, but some of them are infants. They’ll cry for their mothers, and when they do? The whole lot of them will be found. 
 
---
 
Its been several minutes since I heard musket fire, and the last of the shouts from our boys have long since ceased. All I can hear now is the Howling, and some of the women in here saying how we should use the pews to barricade the door. But its hopeless. We all know its hopeless. All we can do now is be strong for the children. But how can I? My home is burnt. My Paul - my Paul - is gone. All our boys are gone. How can I be strong when my strength is gone? 
 
---
 
The Infected have begun hammering away at the church doors and windows. We are surrounded in here. God, Lord - give me strength. Please, Father. Give me strength. Just for a little while longer. Just for a liit-

This Diary was found buried in the rubble of an old church in the center of Andersonsburg, cradled by a long-rotted corpse that appears to have suffered severe blunt trauma wounds along the length of the spine and around the skull. There are multiple other skeletons strewn about the floor of the place, all but one of which appear to have suffered similarly. The other one - an infant’s corpse and one well-hidden in the corner, appears to never have suffered a wound at all; it looks instead to have perished of starvation, likely some days after the events described here. 
 
Outside the church of course, is the town itself. It is currently being picked clean by my colleagues and other members of the University - all for research purposes, of course (although I fear black market scavengers will descend like vultures upon the place once word of its existence spreads) - and it is in a spectacular state of ruin, mostly from what appears to be fire damage. As of this document I am the only person who knows of the existence of this Diary. 
 
Anway. Hell, I’ll update this later. At the moment I’m being called over to help with one of the interns, who’s apparently collapsed and begun to convulse. They’re probably just dehydrated.

6fnwcl,15,2017-06-06,I have a lovely career in tech.. but now I want to get my hands dirty. Advice on career transitioning?,kreacha,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6fnwcl/i_have_a_lovely_career_in_tech_but_now_i_want_to/,"I'm 25, and have bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Psychology. I've got about 4 years of experience as a team lead in tech both in software and hardware as a product manager and ecommerce manager. I'm at a great company with amazing benefits and my salary is decent enough.

Here's the catch: I hate it. I'm sick of staring at a screen all day. I want out. The stress of corporate environments is slowly eating me alive. The pressure, the deadlines. It's not what I want. It's not just this company either. Tech internships during college and 2 different companies after have taught me this. It just isn't my dream.

What I do want: to be outside, at least part of the time. To do something that makes a difference (non profits?) instead of just being another cog. To work with plants or with animals. If I could do anything at all involving getting my hands into some soil, being in the fresh air, traveling, anything away from a screen at least part of the time it would mean the world to me.

Here's the problem: it seems like the only ways to do this are to go back to school full time and start a new career, or take a very serious salary and benefits cut. I could work at a greenhouse or WWOOF but there's this part of my soul that just can't give up this job security I've worked so hard for.

Advice on careers that might fit me? Jobs where my current skills might still apply but would give me more of what I want? Anything that's not just completely starting over?

Thank you, so much, in advance.

TL;DR I'm on a decent career track in tech but want to do something involving getting outside more in nature without giving up the pay and benefits."
6fo49o,1,2017-06-06,Am I getting bamboozled?,Acheroni,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6fo49o/am_i_getting_bamboozled/,"Recently had a phone interview for a telecommute position with a silicon valley based startup. Thank you guys in advance for reading and for any help.

**Background:**

&amp;nbsp;

I graduate with a BS in Computer Science this fall, a professor sent out information for internships at company in question.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Call:**

&amp;nbsp;

So I had a phone interview with the CEO of the company, which was unusual but it's a startup, so it's understandable. The interview mostly talked about projects the company was working on, what fields I was interested in, how the company works, etc.

Basically the company is looking for remote workers to participate in 2 week sprints.

Importantly, there were no technical questions, quizzes, etc. Which seemed unusual.

But now we move onto the part that makes me hesitant.

&amp;nbsp;

**Compensation:**

&amp;nbsp;

So I'll start this by saying this is my first CS interview, and beyond what local jobs and salary websites tell me, I don't know whats reasonable for a CS intern.

He asks me what I'm looking for, how often I'm available, etc.
I tell him I'm available for a full time job if they need it, and I'm looking for standard or as an intern, below standard. So somewhere around 52-65K.

He seems pretty taken aback, and goes on a bit with math and how much this is hourly, and what kind of position this is.

I backpedal a little bit, which could have been a mistake, and say that I may have accidentally highballed them, and that I'm willing to consider what they offer, because I'm not really experienced with what the rates are. 

We talk some more, it seems like he's really keen on hiring me, and we end the call.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Second Call (of nature):**

&amp;nbsp;

About 15 minutes after the call I'm taking a shit and he calls me back. He asks about salary again, and says they want to offer between 20-25$ hourly.

Furthermore he asks what I'm currently making, which is 10.50 part time at a university job, and implies how much more his offer is.

So I tell him I'm having a few more interviews this week, and that I'll consider my options.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:**
20-25$ internship gig at a startup, is it a bamboozle, or standard?"

What is the best language or package of languages I should learn before I graduate? 

I have recently spent 8 months at a chemical company in a developer role as an intern. During this time, I built a full-stack web application from a ground-up SQL database to the HTML/JS/CSS and vb.NET script. This was a very extensive project, but I had no prior experience to programming; however, it has very much diverged my career path. I would like to diversify myself so that I am able to fill an entry level developer role whether it be .NET developer or a more engineering/simulation programmer (ANSYS). I am still obviously a beginning programmer, but I am a quick learner; hence, I seek this great community for guidance on what I should learn next.

Also, I will spend another 4 months at the company now, developing more VB.NET applications. Is this sufficient for my resume, or should I try to build side projects after work/school?"

Stat/Math major from respectable school, more focused in stats took up to multivariable and linear algebra on the math side.

So basically, given all that what should I do to learn CS and ultimately get a CS job? I see 2-3 routes and would like your opinions on this and recommendations

1) Stay in undergrad to do a major in CS (3 years or more?)

2) Go to a CS grad program. However I don't have many CS classes so not sure if this is possible.

3) learn on my own. Seems the hardest way to go about it"
6fp45x,0,2017-06-06,Seemingly scammed by a hypnotherapist - looking for help. Considering a call for collective action.,poisondragon,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6fp45x/seemingly_scammed_by_a_hypnotherapist_looking_for/,"Hello everyone,

I have a dilemma I'd like your advice on. Toward the end of April, 2017, I booked a phone session with a person who calls herself a “hypnotherapist” and is working out of a suburb of Los Angeles, so that I could potentially qualify for an internship she was offering. The first time I got on the phone with her she asked me if I was calling to get referrals (apparently she gives her interns and graduates of her program 20 to 30 referrals per week.) Then she told me I would have to complete a specific program to get these referrals – but, that she was offering to allow me to do so for free, only if I would agree to intern for her. 

I addressed at the beginning of the call that I was quite broke and had no extra money, yet she explained I would have to pay for an initial session with her to qualify for this internship. She seemed to have literally no scruples asking me to pay by hanging her alleged “referrals” in front of my nose. At this point, I guess I should have gotten suspicious but as a young hypnotherapy practitioner myself I need to start somewhere and getting referrals is like a holy grail for whomever starts in this line of work. I promptly agreed to her deal as it's difficult to find initial clients.

She mentioned that an introductory 3 hour session at $425 would be necessary to qualify for the internship, which I originally didn't agree to. I told her I would need time to think about it, and she started baited me by saying she only had one opening in the next week for a session and I would have to decide immediately. I probably should have hung up at that time, but again, I really wanted the referrals and she appeared confident and incidentally convincing (as most professional scammers do). 

So I eventually agreed to the introductory consultation which consisted of:

- 1.5 hour phone survey where she calculated a long list of issues she believed I could benefit from getting hypnosis for (which she later wrote up on a budget proposal)
- another hour of listening to a recorded tape where she advertised her services, credentials and supposed expertise
- the last half hour giving me an absolutely terrible hypnotic “induction” which was not at all effective and more or less entirely scripted. 

Basically, none of this “session” she told me I had to pay for benefited me to any degree, and was entirely designed for her to merely try making more money off of me. 

When I did a bit of research on her, I realized that she has confabulated some of her credentials (for instance, she says she has a PhD from a school that doesn't exist.) She also says she has over 40 years of experience as a hypnotherapist, which definitely does not seem accurate, given her limited knowledge of the art and its applications. 

After our first phone “session”, she charged my card an additional $150 for a hypnotic suggestion CD that I had clearly told her I did not want. After calling her again and telling her to please remove this charge (during which she told me that it would be a pity to not receive something that would benefit me, that I would just be wasting something she took time to produce, etc), she finally sent me a form saying that she would refund me the $150, but only if I agreed not to press charges on her or her company.

The thing is, I'm not even sure if her company is legit. I assume she realizes that she would have some grounds for being sued, as she specifically asked me to sign on the paper that said I would not attempt allegations in order to get my $150 back. I haven't done so yet, as I think I can and should get an entire refund, since she manipulated me out of my money. 

One of the reasons I post here on Reddit is I also am contemplating whether it's possible to start a collective action lawsuit against her, since it's more than probable she has swindled other people in similar ways in the past (I can't tell how many exactly, but there have surely been at least a few.) If I had not been seeking an internship but instead had an introductory session as a potential client, she was suggesting instead a package of $20,000 for the sessions she believed I needed (she posed as generous to rather offer an internship at $10/hour doing menial tasks for her.) I imagine she has gouged this much money from people in the past, considering how opportunistic, persistent and ruthless she has been with me in her approach. 

Please, I feel helpless about this situation and am requesting your advice and support. I am most likely going to see a lawyer for a free consultation at some point, but any advice from one of you here would be highly valued. I would appreciate any information on how I can intend a collective action and before that, call for witnesses or other people involved. I am aware that the other victims are unlikely to read this post – but who knows, I might get lucky. 

Thank you very much for your time and for any constructive comments you might have. "

I was wondering what I can do with all this free time in order land an internship for next summer?

It seems like all of my friends have internships except for me, I'm not fucked for not having anything this summer am I? I feel like I'm at a huge disadvantage to everybody else who is getting practical experience over the summer while I'm at home sitting on my ass.

I already started working through Cracking The Coding Interview, but I'm not really sure what else I can do to prepare myself to get an internship next summer. Any ideas? Also what would be some companies that I have a decent shot at once it's time to start applying again (considering I've only taken 3 CS classes so far)?

6fqezu,0,2017-06-06,Dreaming of BigN/Unicorns? STUDY FOR INTERNSHIPS!,oneyear_study,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6fqezu/dreaming_of_bignunicorns_study_for_internships/,"tl;dr: For most BigN/Unicorns, internship interviews are *much* easier and less stressful than full-time interviews and if you really want to work for these companies, study hard for the internship interviews!

I recently graduated with a bachelors and I had the opportunity to interview with BigN/Unicorn companies *many* times for internships during my last two years in uni.

I was unsuccessful at passing almost all of them, although I felt like I came really close many times (which is not much of an indicator).

I studied, but not nearly enough. Now I'm pounding out leetcode problems trying to prepare for entry level related positions with these companies (I got crushed at my onsites for new grad jobs during my last year in uni). I'm nowhere near prepared and I've already realized one thing: 
I had *so* many interviews that were so much easier than I had realized. To give you an idea, for one of the Big4 I had internship interview questions like: 

* Adding 2 numbers together that were represented in int arrays
* 2Sum problem (1 unique solution pair)
* Balancing parenthesis

At the time I thought these were pretty challenging, and I was not even able to complete the adding 2 numbers problem correctly. Now I'm looking back at these problems realizing how SIMPLE they are, and wishing I would have realized this 2 years ago. For many of these top tech companies, full time employment is much more difficult to get than internships. Even when you disregard the fact that the questions are more difficult, you typically have many more interviews for full time that include onsites, where some of the BigN never even make you come onsite for internship interviews.

**Please realize how much easier it is to get internships with these companies than full time employment before it is too late.** I'm not trying to make it sound like the full time interviews are impossible, I'm just surprised by how much of a difference in difficulty there is between full time and internship interviews for many of these top companies, especially for the ones that have relatively easy conversion processes."
6fqfe2,1,2017-06-06,Go Freelance? (Video editing and production),CGThrowaway10,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6fqfe2/go_freelance_video_editing_and_production/,"Hey Reddit, using throwaway to try and include as much detail as possible, so this might end up kinda long, thanks in advance. If there's a better place to post please let me know.


I'm 28, single male, no kids or wife relying on me. I do have a dog, probably not that relevant but aside from being awesome he isn't free. I live in the Denver area, pretty good for my field of work given that I'm not skilled or experienced enough for a large, competitive market. I have a degree in biology but didn't like it (long story short) and went back to learn video and radio production, with an emphasis on sports from a year-long vocational program. That program ended in April of 2014. I spent a year doing anything related that I could (including a youth sports filming gig), then got a contract job for a year doing computer desk work basically (regular hours but no benefits) and now my current, very similar job for 15 months. I make decent wage for my skills/experience and have solid benefits there. That's the relevant background info.


My current job is not quite sports production. The closest I get is recording the live games, and segmenting them for re-air. We also deal with commercials and shows which are the bread and butter of our work and have jack shit to deal with sports 90% of the time. There's zero creativity, zero variety, zero praise and zero windows to the outside. It's a thankless, unfulfilling computer desk job that I took because of the benefits and ""getting my foot in the door"". I've had hundreds, maybe thousands, of commercials and shows go through me and only had two mistakes go to air. Even a robot would have some small percentage of errors. My accuracy is unmatched.


After a year (and only one mistake at the time) I asked my boss for a raise. He said the company doesn't really work that way, and they only do raises at the end of the year. Last year I got a 1% raise at the end of the year after ten months of work. They considered that generous because only people that were there a full year were supposed to get a raise. And even then it was only 3% and performance had ZERO weight on whether you got it or not. All you had to do was not get fired.


I also asked my boss if there was a way to get me into the production side of things. It's literally down the hall and for some of the people, the next door over. In my position summer is extra slow and we have a lot of down time. I wanted to spend it trying to learn those skills and hopefully shoehorn my way into a position eventually. I have seen this happen in other positions multiple times with this company. Despite my boss agreeing to talk to those guys, all my email messages were unanswered or ""Yeah, I'll see about it for next schedule"". When I decided to just show up and try to kinda force my way in, most people would let me watch but that was about it. It feels like trying to make friends in high school with a new clique. Short answers, cold shoulders and me just kinda standing against the wall out of the way. In my 15 months at my job, I have seen exactly one job posting for what they do. It was a part time, minimum wage intern position that I would have had to leave my current gig for.


I have also applied for a similar position in the company to my current one. Slightly more pay and responsibility, but nothing to do with sports. I have seen a handful of people go this route onto jobs that I would actually like to do. In three months they have had three openings for that position. I interviewed with the same people (coworkers), for the same job, three different times. The first time I was passed over because I was ""too valuable"" in my current position. My coworker/interviewer said I was his top pick but the higher ups said no. This was right around, (I think after) the time my boss denied me a raise. The second time I was passed over for another internal candidate in my exact department. Same title and everything, but he had been there almost a whole year longer. No complaints, he deserves it. Spoiler alert: all three times, management failed to tell me I didn't get the gig before I figured it out or heard through the grapevine.


Today I found out I won't be getting the final open position they have. They hired an outside candidate. Maybe she's kickass, but I have a near flawless record in house, can do the job they want and have 2 years in the industry (3 if you count my first year bouncing around). They asked for a video demo to show my editing experience. The only one I have is from school 3 years ago, because I had to work regular hours for stability and benefits. It's not a good representation of my quality of work. Another candidate I talked to made one for the interview and brought it in. He said it wasn't well received to do it like that. If that wasn't the dealmaker/breaker, what is? It's not my track record. They have hired people with less experience to that job, so I don't think it's that either. Maybe she's a complete rockstar, I can accept that if true but she's probably not. The company has hired a few idiots and been shown to have a hiring system that only cares about the bottom line. 


That leaves me with three reasons to be denied: I'm still ""more valuable"" in my current position, they flat out don't like my personality/don't interview well or that they're trying to funnel me into master control. Master control is 24 hour and I would start with the overnights on shitty days with no guarantee of when I would move. Not to mention I consider it to be a career black hole. Once you get into master control it's really tough to get out. And it's also barely sports production. I saw enough of it at my first contract job and it's extremely boring and unfulfilling. All three options are pretty telling about what management really thinks about me. And it feels like they feel like I don't have potential or that I'm not worth promoting or that I don't deserve it or they just don't like me. All the conclusions I can draw are negative.


So I'm pretty burnt out about working there currently. I was denied three separate times for the same position and my only hope for a raise (45 cents! we ballin' now!) happens six months from now. And I would have to stay for a bit into the new year to see any reward for that. At this point I don't feel I have a future in the company and am only staying so I can pay my bills and have benefits.


So what the hell should I do? I talked to a former class mate that does freelance work, more or less what I'd like to do. He said his health care plan is 68 per month. Manageable. I also just built a new pc mostly for gaming but also to start editing again and make a new demo. I do not have a camera or any other equipment but my roommate does that I might be able to borrow. My school also might let me use a camera. Worst case I could rent one. I could contact high schools, small colleges and maybe even semi-pro teams here to get a start building my demo. But at the moment have very little to show for it. Recently I had a gig filming college lacrosse which went great. But the only work I have from it is camera work. If I made a demo out of it, it would be kind of monotone and I would have to try to showcase my editing skills as much as possible with very little to work with. This is pretty different from making creative choices to produce a commercial or show segment that tells a story.


Summer is wedding season, so I could do that, but it dies off in the fall and I didn't really like it to be honest. I did photo booth work at weddings in my first year, so I don't have actual wedding photography experience.


I also drove Lyft for a summer/fall which was okay. I think I could get by doing that as my main money source while I freelance video. But my car has 145,000 miles on it despite being a 2010. It's been well taken care of but using it that much worries me a bit.


I could try writing sports articles, but don't see that as very promising compared to the time it would take. I'd also love to get into e-sports video production considering the industry is breaking out in a big way and video games is one of my biggest passions other than sports.


I'd be giving up stability, regular 40 hours and benefits but more actively pursuing what I went to school for 4 years ago. My current company appears to have no interest in helping me get there, just how I can help them the most for the least $. Sounds like health insurance is affordable on my own. I don't smoke or have pre-existing conditions, nobody else on my plan with me. I don't have any kind of savings or emergency fund. I could start building one but right now I don't have one. I don't even really have a strict budget to be honest. I make enough to be comfortable, but not enough to save up without really committing to it. I understand this is probably a good starting point, along with buying editing software and using my connections to try and start freelancing.


What am I not considering? Is this just a ""grass is greener"" situation? My job is pretty damn easy, consistent hours and benefits. And I worked pretty hard and through some shit jobs to get there. It's also shaping up to be a complete dead end. I'm daydreaming about surprising them by putting in my two weeks, but it's scary. Thanks again for reading and any advice

6fqz6h,3,2017-06-06,Very worried about my future,twintowersrubble,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/6fqz6h/very_worried_about_my_future/,"Hello everyone, I have been very confused lately after recently starting a summer internship I had been offered at a small company. After 2 days at my internship, I already want to quit. At school, i majored in computer engineering, and only have one more semester to go until graduation. 

However, at the past few internships I've had, they all seem to have one trait in common in that I quickly become bored out of my mind with the work. I have just come to despise the corporate environment. Having a boss, who has a boss, who has a boss, everything just seems like a pecking order. I hate the feeling of being controlled by a person, and having to report to somebody. I hate having to sit in a chair from 9 to 5 in front of a blinding computer screen. I hate being chained down.

Also, the work I do at the internship is very repetitive and I quickly lost interest. I only have to continue because if I quit, I won't have a job. Quite frankly, I often think about what will happen to me at a full time position. If I couldn't survive a few days at an internship without already burning out, how am I supposed to survive a few years at a full time job? Programming is great and all, but it doesn't excite me as much as it used to. The company is growing, and often I ask myself how happy I would be if I were the CEO. The boss of everyone, instead of somebody's bitch. A wage slave. 

Also the employees all seem to be pretending to be happy. But when they go home I can tell they cry out of depression. I'm very worried about not being able to find a path after I graduate and I would just like to seek guidance before it's too late. I'm 21 years old and I need help."

I just finished my freshman year at a small liberal arts college with a good but not necessarily well-known computer science program. I took classes on Python, JavaScript/web development , C++, and databases. Because of this and a couple of references, I was able to land an internship at a Fortune 1000 financial services company as an IT Engineer. So far I've been doing some Python development for some smaller projects and I'm about to start development on a user interface as part of a larger project (Python back end and web front end).

It's been a good internship so far, and I could possibly see myself staying with the company after graduation, but for now I'm strongly considering looking elsewhere for the next 2 summers before I graduate. Ultimately I'm really interested in software engineering and cybersecurity. What should I focus on, be intentional about, and document during this internship in order to maximize how much this internship will help me when looking for internships next year?

Also, as I've described my current situation above, I'm more than open to any other words of advice. I'm also willing to answer questions about the company I'm working for and my university.

I did an internship with a small wealth finance company working in their office as the IT Support Technician on site. I worked remotely with a MSP to escalate anything I couldn't handle but I handled all the onsite hardware and Help Desk-like activities. The internship was coming to a standstill and I was finding myself not being challenged, so I recently left and was offered a position with a highly respected medical company (and a large corporation vs. small business) in my area as the ""IT Desktop Support Intern"". It is working in the help desk area. I will also get to shadow higher level technicians and people of that nature along the way of this internship. This is a very well known company in my specific area and is definitely a resume booster - not to mention I will actually be working in a ""real"" IT department with other techs and get to shadow higher level people.

Although this internship is great and I will learn a ton... I eventually want to move out of the whole ""support"" roles and maybe in to a higher level position such as management or administration of some sort.

With that being said - if I graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Information Systems, have almost 2 years of internship experience (both with reputable companies).. what jobs should I expect to take when I graduate. I understand you have to ""work your way up""... but in my current position should I be looking to get any certifications to kind of boost me above the other graduates? I'm just kind of at that point where I don't know what to do because there is so much going on in the IT world!

Anyone been in a similar situation as me and can offer some insight? Where is the money and industry going towards in the IT world in the next year or two and where do you recommend looking?

6frqo2,4,2017-06-07,Arteithio,BorkOgredrive,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6frqo2/arteithio/,"When I was a freshman in college, my friends and I made an excursion to an abandoned hospital twenty miles outside of the city. A group of juniors in my communications class told me about the twisted stories of the Lakewood Sanatorium. Supposedly, up to two hundred patients and staff died at Lakewood as a result of a tuberculosis outbreak that was not quarantined properly by incompetent staff members. Ever since then, the place was shut down and brave people who have ventured into the sanatorium with GoPros and EMF meters came out traumatized. 

As bored, thrill-seeking adolescents and college freshmen with easy course loads, my friends Mark, Florence, Gordon and I foolishly ventured into territory that would come back to haunt me later. 

Armed with a night vision camera, a few flashlights, a Costco-sized box of Cheez-Its, sleeping bags, and Flo’s old Ouija board, we decided to explore Lakewood Buzzfeed Unsolved style on a chilly Friday night in the middle of February. Mark parked his car outside of the east wing, and we got ready for a night of ghost-hunting. To be honest, it was pretty much an uneventful night, until we reached the psychiatric ward. In horror movies, the psych ward of an abandoned hospital was always the scariest, where the serial killer catches his victims, or where the evilest spirits reside. Nothing crazy happened to us, not before Flo suggested that we play around the with Ouija board. At this point, we were itching for something, anything, to scare the hell out of us, so we eagerly set up the board and a few lanterns. 

“Ok guys,” Flo blew the dust off the board, and we all put our hands on the pointer. “Is there anyone here who would like to chat for a while?” At first, nothing happened at all, and we all just sat there in silence. I was beginning to get disappointed but then the pointer started to move toward YES. 

“Are you guys moving this?” 
“No, are you?” 
“Nah, I think Gordon is.”
“What? I’m not!”

“Guys,” Flo tried to settle us down. “Hello spirit, what is your name?” The pointer slowly moved to form a very long string of letters. A-R-T-E-I-T-H-I-O. I could tell that everyone was visibly affected, but I extremely skeptical despite the chills running down my spine. 

“That’s not even a name. This isn’t even real. Gordon I can see you moving thing fucking thing!” Mark apparently felt the same way I did. “Only idiots will believe in this thing. Just put it away, Flo.” Frustrated, he took his hands off the pointer and started collecting the lanterns. I had a thing for Mark back then, so I agreed with him and followed suit.

“Guys! You have to properly say goodbye first!” Florence started to panic and immediately moved the pointer on top of GOODBYE and Gordon complained about Mark making false accusations. 

“That thing is bullshit anyway.” Mark didn’t care. Flo quickly packed up her Ouija board, but I could tell that she was very agitated and worried. 

“You’re not supposed to just do that!” As Flo and Mark bickered, I noticed that the temperature of the room had dropped. Our shadows seemed to dance along the walls for a moment. 

“Goodbye.” I heard a deep male voice whisper right next to my ear. I was a skeptic of paranormal activity up to that very moment. The only thought I had in my scrambled brain was to get out the hell out of there. 

After the incident with the Ouija board, I managed to convince my friends to drive back to campus and forget about sleeping over. Flo could sense that something was wrong, but I didn’t want to seem like a crybaby in front of the others. 

Florence and I stayed best friends and roommates until graduation, but Mark found better friends after joining a frat and Gordon turned to weed and molly. For the rest of my time at college, I rarely found time outside of homework and internships to socialize besides my beloved judo class. I focused much of my energy on graduating with honors and avoided admitting that something was wrong with me. 

It started off as small things that I always brushed off. I would often hear very soft whispers in my ears before going to sleep, so quiet that at first I could never distinguish any words, just soft murmurs. It became increasingly hard at around the end of junior year to keep up with school work when I couldn’t fall asleep anymore, because the murmurs became louder and more distracting, though still indistinguishable. I was literally a living zombie all the time due to lack of sleep, so I didn’t think too much about it and just wrote it off as a symptom of sleep deprivation.

It only got progressively worse. Sometimes when I watched Netflix or listened to music, I would hear very unexpected and out-of-place dialogue, or the lyrics to a familiar song would be altered momentarily. I sometimes heard the ringing of a phone in my apartment, even though we hand no landline, and my cell phone was literally right in my hand. I even stopped going to judo every week because all I wanted to do was sleep. 

At the beginning of finals season of my last semester at college, the soft murmurs every night turned into a very distinct and horrifying deep male voice. I was grabbing a sandwich and some sugar to keep me awake at a Seven Eleven across the street from the library. As I reached for a bottle of coke, someone said, “You really sure? You’re already such a fatass.”

I didn’t know who spoke at first, so I ignored it and paid for my late night meal. While I was fumbling to get my credit card, the same voice spoke again. 

“You’re so stupid and clumsy. No wonder you don’t have any friends.” The voice seemed to laugh at me. I froze and looked behind me, and then back to the female cashier.

“Did you say something?” I asked her. She looked surprised and shook her head. 

As I exited the store, the voice followed me, ever so faintly now, that I felt like someone was watching and stalking me. I was so frightened while crossing the street that I felt like my legs were frozen and time seemed to move infinitely slowly. When I re-entered the warm lobby of the library, the voice was gone, and I regained self-control. Once again, I convinced myself that it was just sleep deprivation and that no matter what kinds of hallucinations I was having, I had to ace those finals. It was my last stretch of college and I worked too hard for everything to fall apart now. Although I didn’t realize it yet, this was the first time Arteithio spoke to me. He had finally manifested himself inside of me three years after I put my hands on that dusty old Ouija board.

I crossed the finish line very badly beaten but still alive. Even though my health was terrible, my final grades were good enough and I managed to graduate with honors and land a position as a junior consultant at a large bank in New York City. The company offered a decent salary with a very handsome year-end bonus, and I was very excited to move to the Big Apple, proud of the fact that my numerous all-nighters and endless cramming sessions finally paid off. The only sad part was that Flo was hired at a graphic design firm based out of Philadelphia, and for the first time in four years, I was going to be truly alone. 

I was very anxious to kick start my new career, and my excitement started to turn into panic. I started only a week after graduation, and moved into a small studio apartment in a high-rise building with an amazing view of the Hudson River. 
However, Arteithio visited me increasingly often and always questioned my intelligence and worthiness of my position. I immediately regretted putting my hands on the Ouija board at Lakewood Sanatorium after hearing his deep voice. He had taken over my body completely, and I just knew that nobody would have believed me if I had told them of the demon that lived inside of my head. Besides, I had worked so hard to get my career off the ground, I wasn’t going to put my reputation on the line as a crazy delusional loon. 

I couldn’t sleep the night before my first day at work, because the demonic voice kept telling me over and over that I will mess up and that I don’t deserve to have this coveted job.

I covered my pillow and screamed at him, “Shut the fuck up!” 

“Look at you.” Arteithio just chuckled. “You’re worthless.”

He was right. I was actually surprised that I got the job in the first place. I was a nervous wreck when the recruiter interviewed me back before I graduated and I stumbled on even the simplest questions. How did I get the job in the first place? Was I really qualified? I tried to push all those thoughts away, but Arteithio validated all of my thoughts. 

My first day of work was an absolute nightmare. I was hurriedly shown around my department and my supervisor put me straight to work, and I wasn’t allowed to go home until around midnight. That night, when I got home to my dark and eerie apartment, a wave of loneliness swept over me, and uneasiness churned my stomach. I heard my phone ring but nobody was calling. I thought I put away my milk in the morning after breakfast but it was out there on the countertop, with grey mold festering at the mouth of the carton. Pinching my nose, I approached the rotten milk, and the mold that was previously there suddenly was gone, and the milk carton was actually the toaster. 

“You’re an idiot.” The voice that had been bothering me pretty much all day had followed me home and continued to insult my existence. Arteithio told me he was going to drag me to hell, and he was going to break me and take my soul with him.
 
Things only got increasingly worse. My company paid me well, but I was worked like a mule. I worked at least 70 hours a week and when I was not slaving away on the 32nd floor of the company building, I was in my apartment, alone with a demon who made my life a living hell. I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore because Arteithio would comment on how ugly and disgusting I was. Sometimes, I’d see a rotten, bleeding face looking back at me, and it was scarier than what any horror movie makeup artist could conjure. 

One morning I woke up and couldn’t feel my left arm, only to see that it had been dismembered by Arteithio, and there was blood everywhere on my sheets. He loomed over me, a figureless shadow, and I could feel a fiery, hot breath on my face as the pain from my arm surrounded me with darkness. I woke up later that day to a very angry supervisor yelling at me to show up immediately because I was 3 hours late for work. 

None of that compared to what happened on August 4th. On August 4th, Arteithio kept his promise and I went to hell. 

The day started off as usual, with Arteithio wishing a good morning sarcastically after I had gotten around two hours of restless sleep. I ran to the bathroom and splashed my face with cold water, but the temperature in my apartment suddenly rose. I felt like I was melting from the heat and cranked up the air conditioning, even though I had work in an hour. The television started acting up again while I was getting ready in the bathroom, but when I stepped into the living room, the TV wasn’t even on. Frustrated, I violently unplugged all electrical appliances in sight. “Stupid, stupid, so stupid.” Arteithio kept yelling in my ear. 

Then, he was gone for a few minutes as I collected myself and trudged to the bathroom to get ready for another day of work. I stared at my reflection in the medicine cabinet mirror. My hair was a mess, my dark circles were very prominent and I was running out of concealer again. I splashed my face with water, and when I looked back up at the mirror, I screamed a horrifying, blood-curdling scream. One side of my face was drooping and melting. I furiously tried to hold my face up in hopes of stopping the mutation. It was all useless, because I felt my knees go weak as the right side of my face melted into a puddle of flesh and blood that all seems to slip through my hands into the bathroom sink. My body was in so much pain that I started to scratch and pull at my skin to make it stop. I was bleeding from the self-inflicted wounds, and where my legs used to be, there was a puddle of melted skin and flesh. I groped around what remained of my legs in disbelief, and I felt nothing but hot oozing liquid, smelling of rot. 

 “You idiot.” A woman’s voice this time called out to me. I froze, and suddenly a cacophony of voices bombarded me, none of them distinguishable. My vision blurred and indistinguishable shapes danced around me, screaming and laughing at my pain. Through the murmur of voices, I could hear distinctively the laughter of the demon who had invaded my body and consciousness all those years ago. A huge weight pushed my whole body down, deep into the ground. I saw myself being pushed down through each of the 22 floors below me in my apartment complex and into the ground. I was pushed deep into the earth, and it didn’t stop until my body was pressed up against burning charcoals that scorched my skin. All around me was bubbling, molten lava. 

 “This is what you get for being useless and ungrateful.” My vision started to fade as I felt a cold hand grasp me by the neck. As I gasped for air, the hand of the demon tightens. Arteithio’s voice was back, laughing maniacally. “You can’t ever escape my domain. Your soul is mine now.” The huge dark shadow loomed over my weak body, and choked me until I could no longer feel my body. I stayed there, unable to move, in a puddle of my own blood and tears, and I begged Arteithio to make the pain stop. 

“Never.” Searing pain ran its course through my body once again and I screamed in agony. 

I found feeling in my arm and with a very shaky hand pulled out my phone from my pocket. It took me a few tries but I finally was able to get a call going between waves of pain and insults from Arteithio. 

“Hello? Hello? Jen, is that you? What’s wrong? Jen?”

“Flo,” I mustered between labored breaths, “I need your… your help. Pl.. Please.”

“Jen? Are you okay? Je…” She sounded distressed. 

I could no longer hear Flo anymore because my body had buckled from the pain. Arteithio had won. Everything was dark and I felt the searing flames subside into icy coldness before I completely let go.

The next thing I knew, I was in the back of an ambulance. Flo and my parents were both there. I don’t remember much about how I got there or how much time had passed. An EMT was next to my mother, and I screamed when I saw his face, the shadowy grin of Arteithio. He was disguised to get my family and best friend. I wasn’t about to lose the people I love, so I lunged at the fucker with all my strength and scratched at his face. I was restrained immediately and everything went black again. 

The next time I woke up, I was in a hospital room, and my mother was holding my hand and crying softly. “Mom,” I choked out a few words against my dry throat, “I’m sorry.”

“Honey, it’s okay,” She seemed surprised and at the same time relieved as she started stroking my hair, “you will be okay. I promise.”

Later that day the doctor came in and swiftly told me I had schizophrenia, and basically I was seeing things that weren’t real. Arteithio was a product of hallucinations originating from different areas of my brain. He then showed me a series of scans of my brain, pointing out areas of increased activity, as if he expected me to remember everything while I was hooked up to a million machines and sleepy as fuck. The main thing was, I wasn’t alone. Thousands of people are struggling and going through the same things as me. I think I’ll ask Flo for more details later, if I remember or care enough. 

I’m on anti-psychotics and neuroleptics. Arteithio only sometimes visits me now but I’m planning to never go back to hell again. Anyways, that’s the story of how I thought I was possessed by a demon. I’ll be logging off now, the drugs are making me sleepy again and the hospital wifi sucks. Thanks for sitting through this, it means a lot to me.

But throughout my degree I enjoyed the few programming classes I had, and so decided to pursue another degree in cs. I wish I made the switch sooner because I am really enjoying what I have been learning so far! 

Anyways, I am currently finishing up first year courses this summer, and due to my first degree, I will be ready for second year this Fall. I really want to pursue internships for 2018 (either winter or spring) and am wondering if I should include my previous degree and/or experience related to that degree on my resume? The experiences I've had didn't involve cs, but they were technical and engineering related. Would this be advantageous on a cs resume? 

Thanks to this subreddit I've learned of a couple things that I should tackle including side projects, studying algorithms for interviews, etc. But is there anything else that can allow me to standout among candidates applying for internships out of first/second year? I plan to get involved in cs clubs, try hackathons and attempt to maintain a high gpa.

I appreciate any advice and would like to take a moment to thank everyone here for their helpful tips and anecdotes! As a lurker for 3-4 months, this  has been one of my favourite places on the internet!"

GPA AND SAT:

This is the weakest area of my application which I why I am not sure I should apply. The other areas of my application are pretty good which is why I'm still considering sending an application.

My cumulative GPA in college is a 3.6 and I took IB and got 30 points, getting the diploma. 

My SAT is the old version I took as a high schooler. I got a 1900.

LEGACY:

This is probably the most important part of my application. My great grandfather has a scholarship in his name called the Yosaji Morita scholarship which is funded by my grandpa's brother who is an alumni. He and I are close but not sure if this connection counts as legacy. But since I am a direct descendant of the man who's name is in the scholarship I was thinking it might count.

RACE/BACKGROUND:

I am mixed race (Argentine and Japanese)

I have lived in USA, China, Switzerland, and Chile and am fluent in English, French and Spanish

EXTRA CURRICULAR:

I was an intern at VANS (VF CORP). I worked with their team in China and helped them launch their E-Commerce site to Chinese consumers, the worlds largest market

I worked at my college's IT department helping with tech troubleshooting and maintenance

I worked as a Busboy at my schools dining hall

I was a member of the Students working for non profit organizations club, we provide business consulting for local non-profits, this year we helped the Ithaca Museum of Earth with brand and internal awareness 

Asian American club member, we planned and participated in many cultural events 

I was my high school's soccer team captain

I was a student council representative my junior and senior year in high school

I was a member of the interact volunteer club planning committee as we organized volunteer work with local dog shelters, orphanages, and retirement homes

AWARDS-

Deans list during my latest semester

national honor society

ESSAY- 

My experienced college advisor stated that my essay was at an Ivy League level



That's all I got! Not sure if I should apply or just be realistic. I'm hopeful that I'd be considered but not sure. Also I go to college in New York which I hear gives a very slight advantage. Thanks for any help!"

Will changing the computer name of the server and the other computer break anything? We currently have sync center running for certain folders and mapped network drives as well as certain backups that run once a week. 
EDIT: Can't change the name of the server because it has ""Certification Authority Service""

The last guy also left a ton of shared folders on the Server Managar set to ""everyone"" and could be accessed under by clicking on the server under Network in Windows Explorer, by anyone, which we don't want. The folders are already mapped to the correct users on their computers, so I'm wondering if I can stop sharing everything or just set the unused shares to admin only(have already changed permissions to the correct users). It would be nice to just have nothing show up in windows explorer since we have mapped drives in use already.

I'm almost 30 (I know the age plays kind of against me, but when life give you lemons, you know..) and by the upcoming winter I'll be done with my exams, and ready to take my internship:
it is a mandatory step where I live and study, you cannot graduate without doing it. 

Luckily so I may add, because from common experience it usually lands you your first job, unless you end screwing it up majestically.

The company where I mean to apply deal with software solutions for infosec, and they work mainly with Java/Python/Unix-Linux.

Needless to say, I'd like to make a good impression at the interview, and I'm looking for some project to build/work at in august, since that's the only month I'll be able to focus hard on something, since rest of summer/fall will be devoted to studying for exams.

Ideally, this project should be something in Java that should be good enough to show in a github page, and something I can complete in a 2 or 3 weeks timeframe (full time obviously, say 10-12 hrs/day).

As for myself, I'm proficient (at a basic Uni projects level) with Java, C, and I've been using Bash quite a bit on my own. I'm a Linux long time user, and my end goal is getting into pentesting (I plan to get an Offensive Security cert, but to do that I need to gather some money and experience on the workfield, hence the sw dev job).

I don't really like sw developing as a profession, but I feel I don't know enough about it to straight up jump into a pentesting career; my opinion is that you should know how something is done, at least roughly, before understanding why it doesn't work (or in my case, where it is/may be flawed).

Ultimately, I'd like to pick your minds to see what a decent portfolio looks like in your opinion, I have some ideas of my own but I would like to hear others.

Previously, my work experience involves working for and consulting startups in Growth, Sales and Marketing over the past 12 months, as well as having tutored K-12 students in English, Maths and Science for about 5 years.

My career trajectory following graduation (which will be in 2019/2020) I feel will be like this: Management Consulting/Product Management for major consulting/tech firm-&gt; Senior Leadership/Strategy/Marketing/Sales/Product Management Role At Startup (either one I found or an early/mid stage one I join) -&gt; Venture Capital (when I've had my fun working with startups and want to apply that experience to help other entrepreneurs and work in something more compatible with family/more stable).

Help me reddit. Which do you think is the better option?"
6fuijf,4,2017-06-07,Is it appropriate to ask about other intern opportunities at your company when you already have a job?,Smiley-Jo,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/6fuijf/is_it_appropriate_to_ask_about_other_intern/,"I work as a software developer for a company and it's okay but I'm given bugs all day to fix and sometimes they take days to figure out.

I have a hard time focusing on my job because I just look at code 8 hours a day and I don't really have any friends in the workplace to help disconnect from the monotony. And it's upsetting that I'm not doing as well as I thought I would. 

I know for a fact that my company will fire interns if they don't do enough work. Or if they don't do their work well. I've heard horror stories of interns being fired because they didnt do enough work, but then they are lied to about why they are fired because the company doesn't want to tell them they're lazy. 

My company recently had a new HR manager turn down the job due to personal issues, and the two HR workers we have now can't be in the office every day even between the two of them. 

It would be really nice to be able to run errands or work with paperwork for once instead of staring at my computer screen hunched over in my chair. 

They're looking for a full-time hire with a degree, but I wonder if it would be appropriate of me to ask if either of them could use a PA or someone to man the office on the days they can't be there? I'm a bit under qualified for the job, but one or two days out of the week helping another department would be a dream. And then I wouldn't feel as useless working on the same bug for a week. 

But I'm concerned about asking because it may seem like a slap in the face to my current supervisor. And it may seem like I don't like or want my job. I'm concerned I could potentially get fired for asking. 

I'm not really sure what I should do. Should I go on fixing bugs and being brain dead or should I ask and see if I can mix up my week a little? "
6fuo2w,2,2017-06-07,Resigned,vanwold,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6fuo2w/resigned/,"I have been working, first as an unpaid intern and then as a paid independent contractor, for the same company for 3 years.  In January they cut my hours in half, and though it pays well, 12 hours a week isn't much income.  My husband recently went back to work, though his job ends in September.  I texted my boss, who is also my friend, and let her know that I was going to have to resign due to financial issues (12 hrs a week wasn't enough to cover daycare for 2 kids).  I told her I would work the next two weeks, to give her time to find someone and that I would submit my official resignation when I came into the office (which was today).  Today, after getting to work and printing up my resignation, I left it on her desk and texted her.  She responded that I was very unprofessional and I should have scheduled a face to face with her to resign (she is never in the office and was out of town when I sent the text, hence the reason in sending her a text); I told her I was sorry to have upset her and that I had texted her to give her advanced warning, since I never know when she will be in the office.  Was I wrong to giver her a head's up via text? I worked for free for this company for about 18 mos before a paid position was offered; I worked 16 hours initially, then bumped up to 24, then cut down to 12, to ""save money"".  After that, she hired in three new people, and when one of the other assistants left, gave those hours to her son, instead of offering them to me.  I am conflicted, I was not rude in any texts, and honestly thought I was doing a friendly thing by letting her know that I was going to have to resign, before officially submitting my resignation.  Very worried this will affect my ability to find future employment, it was a bridge I never wanted to, nor sought to, burn."

I figured this subreddit is a great community to reach out to people for help as well as to help others through our career. 

To get to the point, I just finished my junior undergraduate year in college with no internship lined up for me over the summer (though I have applied to over 25 different positions the Spring semester). I'm pursuing an undergrad ECE degree and my GPA is around 3.2 and I am involved in numerous clubs through my college career.

Now realizing that obtaining one for this summer will be too late, I am a bit bummed out that things didn't work out for the better. But, I did not want to sit at home all day doing nothing so I am looking for advice for things that I can do over the summer that will help me land a job/co-op/internship in the future. At this very moment, time isnt on my side especially if i'm graduating next year :/

Some things that I am planning to do atm are enhancing my coding skills in languages such as ""C"" or looking into simple projects that I can build over the summer. I got my resume checked out and revised as well.  

And more importantly thank you all for your advice.

6fwiv8,4,2017-06-07,Updated recommendation situation,ThrowawayHahaXD,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6fwiv8/updated_recommendation_situation/,"My previous post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/67rdfh/help_me_choose_who_to_ask_for_letters_of/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link    
Please read that before continuing.    

So it's really crunch time when it comes to recommendations (in most cases... I'll talk about that later). For my area, school ends June 23, but I'm missing the last week, so I basically have 7 school days (!!!) and I wanted to finalize some things.    
In my previous post I just listed all of my teachers and you guys helped give me an idea of who was best to ask. It's been a pretty long time since then, though, and some of my situations have changed.    
1. I've basically ruled out BC and AP Physics at this point. I'm doing ok in the classes, but I don't have the most personal relationship with the teachers.    
2. I could still ask my English teacher. Though I don't know her fantastically well, she really tries to bring out the best in everyone. She also might be a last resort (more on that later).     
3. APCS. I need a STEM rec, and I'm honestly not sure sure about my APCS teacher anymore. I think I have a decent relationship with her, but it might not be enough to warrant a stellar recommendation. I'll give more details in comments if necessary.    
4. Astronomy teacher. I think my relationship with her has improved quite a bit, and she likes to talk to me before and after class, and I've taken initiative almost every class.    
Since my previous post, I have asked my German teacher for a recommendation, which she gladly accepted. However, she says she only writes recommendations for people in one of her classes senior year. I learned this because I asked about a possible schedule conflict, and she said that if I wasn't in her class next year, she wouldn't write me one. She also told me to come talk to her again in September, implying that she only starts writing them in September.    

This leads me to another concern. I will have my Astronomy teacher again next year as my director for a research class, unless something falls through. Should I wait to ask her until the fall as well, once I have an even better personal connection? As far as I know, both my German and Astronomy teachers don't write a ton of recs every year, so I might be able to afford waiting more.     

Other than recs, I have a major scheduling decision to make. I have an internship this summer, but I also have to take a 4th history credit. This means that I am signed up for an online history course at the same time as my internship for about a month. This online course requires meeting in a skype call for an hour every weekday and then some more hours of work. In summary, for about a month of the summer, I will have at least eleven hours of work a day, 8 hours on internship, and 3 hours on the online history course.    

If I don't take the online history course, I'll have to take my final history credit during next year, which would mean cutting out my German class, which would mean losing the German rec. However, I could also take the online history course and switch from German to a post-ap cs class to have more cs classes under my belt (if I want to apply for colleges for cs). In both of these situations where I lose the German class, my GPA increases, because of the weighting of the classes that are being switched. In short, I can have a strong German recommendation, at the cost of a lower GPA and/or less of a CS background. (I'm pretty sure that's a toxic mindset but that's all anyone ever thinks about where I go to school, and I can't really shake it).     

Basically, I've narrowed my rec list down to German, Astronomy, APCS, and English, and I'm not sure where to go from here. "

This comes more as a vent and curiosity about you.
What were your main struggles starting your careers? How did you overcome them?

My case:
At 22 I graduated in Economics;
Still at 22, not mentally ready for a ""career job"", I went to China, where I lived for 8 months (I am from Portugal);
At 23, back to Portugal, I enrolled a Master’s degree in Marketing;
At the same time, I started working at a Startup, in which I still am;
At the moment, I am 25, and this is where my problems start:
-	I thought of marketing as something I would feel passionate about, but I don’t;
-	The startup where I am is under huge financial strain (my salaries never arrive on time, sometimes 2 months later than supposed and I have no contract)

Due to this unfolding of events, I know it’s time for me to start searching for a new job, and even though I received lots of positive feedback from all these previous experiences, my inner voice quickly finds the negatives that surpass those positives. This leaves with no self-esteem to put myself in an interview where I have to sell myself.

Also, I don’t have big ambitions. Due to being prone to burnout and depression when performing under stress for long periods my ultimate ambition is just to have a simple life with lower stress levels and time for myself and my family.

For these next few days I will continue to work on my self-awareness. Then, I will look for internships that seem best suited for me. I already tried entrepreneurial life, so maybe now I will try corporate life. After that, it will depend, but before being 29 I have the objective of going abroad again for at least two months. They say that when you travel your mind (and problems) go with you. It was not my case, so at least I attach my hope to that.

Waiting for your thoughts,
thanks"
6fxnlw,34,2017-06-07,Admitted to Cornell off the Waitlist!,throwaway12839017248,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6fxnlw/admitted_to_cornell_off_the_waitlist/,"Hey Everyone,

I just got into Cornell's college of Arts &amp; Sciences off the waiting list for the FYSA (first year spring admits) program -- if I go, I would start 1 semester later than everyone else.

Goals: Major in CS or CS and Math, then move to California and work as a software engineer.

I previously planned to enroll at Harvey Mudd, and I wanted to get the perspective of any Cornell students on this sub in helping me decide where to go. Here is a list of pros and cons I have so far, if any of you could speak to these points, or know anything else that could help me, I would very much appreciate it!

Harvey Mudd: - 62k/year
Pros:
- Really nice campus and location and weather.

- Prestigious for CS, lots of people have heard of it.
- If I survive 4 years, I would come out really smart
- Nice dorms
- Really nice kids and professors here.
- Everyone knows each other.
- Really smart people. The kids are brilliant, and the teachers are really good at teaching.


Cons:

- The workload is really tough. This is the main killer for HMC, really. I could end up really stressed out, and burn out. And even if I don’t, the low GPA will really cut into my options for jobs or grad/professional school.

- No name recognition. I guess it doesn't matter too much what a stranger at a party thinks of your college, but it would be nice to go to a school that people have at least heard of.
- Outside of STEM, its only ok. But this isn’t as critical.

Cornell: - 70k/year
Pros:
- Closer to home

-  Much better class selection/diversity
- More name recognition  (this is probably negligible in Silicon Valley, but overall)
- More career opportunities on both coasts, but east coast especially? (not sure if this is true, but maybe)
- Easier classes, less stress, more time for extracurriculars/sleep/social things
- I can get a better gpa here
- I like the lack of a huge core here. There are actually pretty minimal requirements, and I knock out quite a few of them with my 9 AP’s


Cons:
- The weather is awful compared to SoCal.

- Professors aren’t as accessible
- I would have to start a semester late. That’s one fewer semester for meeting new people, trying clubs, and 5 fewer classes over my college career. Not to mention the fact that I don’t really know what I would do in my gap semester. Idk if I can find an internship for 3 months in the fall.
- Not as rigorous an education.
- Not sure if Cornell students are “my people”. I really liked all the Mudders I met, but idk if I’d like Cornell students.
- Not as “elite” compared to HMC. Like, everyone I met at HMC’s admitted student weekend was considering only top top tier schools. I met students who were choosing HMC over {Columbia, Harvard, Caltech, MIT, CMU SCS, JHU and others}. I think it might be crazy to turn down HMC for a school like Cornell.
- Its more expensive, so even though I would start a semester late, I would still pay the same amount for 3.5 years here as 4 years at Mudd. That’s kind of sucky.

I wanted to know if I had the application necessary to get into ANY college, at all. Here are my (crappy) stats

**Academics** 

SAT: 1600 (Might take it again, just to be sure, you know); I also took the Old SAT (when I was 6 years old) and got a 2390 (I know, pathetic).

ACT: 36 (36, 36R, 36E, 35S) (Might retake to improve that abysmal science score)

APs: Art History (5), Biology (5), Calculus AB (5), Calculus BC (5), Chemistry (5), Chinese (5), Comparative Gov (5) Computer Science A (5), Computer Science Principles (5), English Lang (5), English Lit (5), Environmental Science (6, yes, *a 6*), European History (5), French (5), German (5), Human Geography (5), Italian (5), Japanese (5), Klingon (Created my own AP test, which is soon to be adopted by College Board; got a 5), Latin (5), Microeconomics (5), Macroeconomics (5), Music Theory (4, I know, it's really bad. Maybe the ""6"" in AP EnvSci will cancel it out?), Physics 1/2/C (5s in all), Psychology (5), Statistics (5), Spanish (5), Studio Art (5), US History (5), World History (5)

(Also, note that my school doesn't offer APs, so I self-studied all of them)

**Extracurriculars**

- Founded a non-profit that sells textbooks to inner city kids at discounted prices. I made $500,000,000 last year, and donated all the money to starving children in Africa.

- Paid internship at Google: gave coding lessons to their head programmers, and led a leadership seminar with their CEO.

- Published journalism in the The Washington Post, CNN, and Forbes (will colleges look down on me for not getting published in The New York Times?)

- Art work put on display at the Louvre.

- Cured cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and the common cold

- Gave a handjob to the Harvard Dean of Admissions (does that go under extracurriculars or honors?)

**Recommendations &amp; Essays**

- Letter of rec from Michelle Obama (I know, it's not unique at all)

- My essays were okay. I talked about how my dad, Walter, was a chemistry teacher who was diagnosed with lung cancer, then ended up turning into a meth dealer. I titled it ""Breaking Dad""

(Also, I think I qualify as a URM, given that I once spent six days in Mexico)

I know my stats are nothing special, but do you think I could get into an okay school. I'm aiming for Harvard, but I'd be lucky if I got into my local community college.

About me:  B.S. in Computer Science, M.S. in Information Technology.  About two years in a help desk/desktop support environment, internship at a major company as a DBA, and over a year experience now as an infrastructure engineer.  I feel confident I can skip the A+ cert, but please correct me if I'm wrong.  My ultimate goal is to get the CISSP certification.

The plan is as follows, generally in the order listed:

**Intermediate:** Net+, Sec+, CCNA: Security, SCYBER, Server+, CSA+.  *If I could get the first three knocked out within the next six months, that would be ideal.*

**Advanced:** CCNP: Security, CASP, CISA, CSSLP

**Expert:** CISM, CISSP

The list as a whole is based on the CompTIA road map.  I did try to spread out the CompTIA certs a little because if I'm reading correct, every time you take one, it renews the previous ones.  As you may can tell, it's focused on security (my graduate concentration), and the Server+ is in there just to satisfy the engineer in me.  I'm open to any feedback you may have.

I have Aspergers, and when I told people about my autism, everyone just started treating me as if I were retarded. They are always speaking ill of me. I just can't take it anymore, man...

Then I totally lost it in a reunion, and I practically told them to fuck the right off (though not exactly in those words). I said that all of that was analogous to pre-teen bullshit, that they were behaving like children, and that all of that was ridiculous.

Now nobody talks to me. Well, they already didn't... But it is so hard to go though it... It's like the atmosphere is horrible, and gloom and doom.

I work in a school, and everyone there are women. I just can't take it anymore... Women can be so evil!!

I study Education and Mathematics (two undergraduation courses). If I drop out and leave all this bullshit, I won't be able to study Education anymore... Though I'm not sure whether I should... I love children, but I hate all this women bullshit, and I don't like people...

But if I drop out from my internship, I won't have anything to do all day... and I won't earn money. Right now, I do earn some money, but I hate all the people, and it hurts me so much. I was told from friends to just go and do my work, but I don't know...

On the bright side, there's so much to learn. I could learn to be patient while involved in all this bullshit, and I could learn not to care so much about this kind of thing...

I could aswell just drop out from Education school and keep up with my internship (which is valid for both Education and Mathematics). Though I don't know... Maybe I'm just generalising? I don't know. Perhaps other schools aren't like that.

“Are you going to come, or not?” I asked, putting on my jacket. 

Lauren looked up from the newspaper. I could tell she was tired – her eyes looked hollow and her mouth hung slightly open. 

“I don’t think so. I just – my stomach just kind of hurts. Just tell me how it is.”
 
Lauren and I were set to meet a leasing agent this morning to tour a home for rent in the heart of Houston, where we would be headed after graduation. We met a few years ago during our freshman year of college in New Jersey. She was (*is*, I guess) a small pixie with warm brown eyes and a pep in her step everywhere she goes. So far, it’s been a perfect romance: Northeastern guy meets Southern girl and follows her after graduation to her hometown. We’re on the cusp of living together in our first apartment – *the* apartment, as I like to call it. 

I sat outside the rental property waiting for the agent to arrive. The neighborhood was exactly what I wanted: oak-lined streets, renovated historic homes, and damaged enough sidewalks to add charm. It actually reminded me a lot of the North. People walked their dogs on bright red leashes and laughed in sleek athletic gear. Their figures danced in the shadows of the trees. I’ve toured six homes for rent on this block alone; Lauren says I’m too picky, but with perfection comes sacrifice — at least, that’s how I see it.

I could’ve signed the lease upon stepping into the foyer, a quaint entry with white penny tiles, a dark wood staircase, and a clear view of large windows looking out over the ivy-filled backyard. A bright kitchen with light gray cabinets and white subway tile was also visible. It was flawless, and it had to be mine. 

Within the week, Lauren and I were unloading the U-Haul at our new place on Woodhead Drive. I was beaming, I mean, really glowing. I couldn’t wait for it: backyard dinners, walks with our (future) dog, lazy Sundays in a sun-drenched living room, the whole bit. Lauren was excited, but a bit dampened. She wore a soft-smile at all times, maybe even only when I was looking. She’s been acting somewhat dull lately. I don’t know. She said her stomach hasn’t been feeling good, but that’s nothing new. I can just tell by her eyes that her light is dim. There’s even a small yellow spot on one of them I noticed the other day at lunch; maybe it’s always been there. Who knows. 

--------------------------------

**November 18th, 2016**

Today was the first day Lauren being really sick. She hasn’t been feeling well for a while, but it escalated this morning to her vomiting a vile, acidic concoction all over our white tile. I feel bad for her, but God dammit. Taking the day off is really not what I need right as I get into the grit of my new job. I already feel like I’m messing up; I was the only guy they chose to hire out of 36 candidates, so I feel the pressure to perform. *To be the best.* I’ve always had the best of everything: internships, job offers, relationships. It’s not that my life appears perfect; it pretty much *is* perfect because of my hard work. It’ll be alright, I guess. I just hope she gets better, *fast*. 

Thankfully we had made her a doctor’s appointment last night. The doctor said it was likely just a stomach bug, and that water and sleep would be the best way to get over it. He sent us out with not much more than a pat on the back and the complacent “Get well!” Whatever, Doc. 

--------------------------------

**November 23rd, 2016**

Last night was rough. I guess Lauren hadn’t hit her worst like I originally thought. She vomited all through the night; she got to the toilet every time except the last. Go figure. We were supposed to have a housewarming party tonight, but that obviously isn't going to happen.

I’m about to leave for work and Lauren is completely knocked out on the couch. I stare at her. Her body is skinny and twisted, much skinnier than it was even a week ago. Our new throw blanket is tangled in her limbs and covered in a sheen of spit and snot on the section near her mouth. I sigh, feeling a wave of anger and sympathy rush over me at once. *It’s not her fault,* I think. But I can’t help be angry at the timing. This isn’t what I imagined even a week of this new life to be like. 

---

As I got into bed tonight thinking about the party-that-should’ve-been, Lauren tugged my sleeve:

“The Doctor saw me again today,” she whispered lethargically. 

I blinked. “What are you talking about? Did you make another appointment with Dr. Skinner?”

“No, the *Doctor,*” she said emphatically, her eyes suddenly widening. The yellow spot on her cornea had grown substantially. “All day, all day we talked,” she almost sang. Her dark stringy hair swung down in front of her crazed eyes as she bobbled her head back and forth on the pillow. 

*She has to be dreaming*, I thought. But her eyes were wide and she looked attentive for the first time in a while. “Lauren, what the hell are you talking about?” I asked forcibly. She said nothing. I could’ve probed further, but I didn’t. I went to bed. 

--------------------------------

**November 29th, 2016**

She won’t stop talking about The Doctor. When she’s not sleeping and I’m not feeding her another bowl of soup, she’s talking about him. *Whoever the hell he is, The Doctor.* She’s basically speaking gibberish at this point; I should really think about taking her to ER, but it’s hard to find an ounce of care in me. Not now. Maybe I always knew this was there — that I always was and always will be a narcissistic asshole, using others as props to the fruition of my own self-image. That empathy is my profound yet easily disguised flaw. In any case, I’m tired of dealing with this Freddy Krueger shit. She’ll get better. She’s supposed to be working by now, and I can’t afford the rent on this place with my salary alone. *It’s not her fault,* that nagging voice reminds me. God dammit, I know! But I think back to this morning at work, when Jonathan— *that son of a bitch* —was recognized by Stan as the most valuable member on our project. *This sickness might not be her fault, but that is,* I think.

*But you’re the new guy,* I think. 
*But you’re the best,* I retort. 

--------------------------------

**November 30th, 2016**

This morning I woke up at 3:32am, and I saw him. He was at the window, face pressed firmly to the glass, a steady glare fixed on Lauren sleeping. He wore the widest smile one can have without showing teeth. His lips were tight—so tight they might rip—while the edges of his grin pulled his cheeks up unfathomably high. His skin was an ashy white, marred with knots of crimson, broken veins on the apples of his cheeks. It looked shrink-wrapped to his skull. *And his icy eyes, God*—they were attentive and loving and sinister and piercing and *knowing.* 

Yet, I felt no fear. I felt trust. *I felt relief.*

I mechanically rose from the warmth of the sheets, taking long, dainty steps towards the window. I was allured. His gaze did not shift from Lauren as I lifted the heavy pane. 

“You *found* me.” The words slithered out of his mouth in a breathy but forcible whisper, swimming in the air of the chilly night. 

--------------------------------

**December 1st, 2016**

Thank God he came back last night. 

--------------------------------

**December 6th, 2016**
She doesn’t eat much anymore. She’s tired of the soup and I don’t care to make it anymore. I skipped work for no reason today; I spent this morning watching her flounder in her own vomit on the couch. Wretched thing. Her belly is swollen and yellow, and her eyes rarely open anymore. She says she needs help, but I barely hear it. I turn up the volume on the midday news as her wails reach the height of desperation. My face is static, lifeless. 

*She needed help a long time ago. How could I know before she did? It’s her fucking body.*

I blankly watch reports of bombings and political advances as I wonder how she let herself get to this point — how she could do this when she *knew* that we were going to be so busy in this new chapter together. *We never had that party*, I realize. A rush of hot blood runs through my head.

We talk about her almost every night now, me and The Doctor. I finally saw his teeth last night; there’s far too many to count. They’re layered so far back in his mouth. Rows and rows of gems. They’re obscenely white, and *God*, they’re beautiful. Polished to perfection! And nothing but the truth comes from that mouth, I’ve learned. I visualize his tight, pursed smile and grin to myself.

I think we both know that this has to come to an end pretty soon. “So you can get on with your life,” he always reminds me. 

My phone buzzes in my lap — another call. I don’t give a fuck.  

--------------------------------

**December 10th, 2016**

She got into the backyard last night, that piece of shit. Right out of the sliding glass door. But I stopped her. We stopped her. I knew this was coming, but I was never scared. 

I just thought my heart would beat faster when I did it — when I felt the fleshy recoil of the hammer after I smashed it into her temple (it was enticingly soft). But my heart rate of a cool 59 bpm was maintained. He held my hand when we did it, when we swung it. I think that helped, his clean nails and perfect fingers guiding my dirty hand. She couldn’t even muster a scream—pathetic if you ask me. 

I haven’t seen The Doctor since and don’t expect to again. What would we talk about now?  

I purposely pull my tie too tight, enjoying the slight choke as I get a whiff of my cologne. I look up into the mirror and flash my pearly whites, almost automatically. *Those whitening strips really do work*, I think. 

I tie my dress shoes, and I go to work. "

After the 1st year, i had a summer break.In this break i made myself understand the basics of C,C++ and Java in 2  months and lots of practice.In 2nd year, the courses were very interesting.I learned about data structures and algorithms and understood it quite well.The one subject i had problem with is Theory of Computation and ended up getting C in that course.During this period, i taught myself Python and a little bit of Android app development.That was my 2nd year.

Now i have another summer break.I couldn't manage to get any internship because i didn't have any skills.My classmates on the other hand, have their parents work in IT in big companies so they had no problem getting one.I decided to learn web development this summer.I have learned the basics of HTML,CSS and java script and just about to enter PHP and sql but i feel like i am not doing anything meaningful that would get me a job.

What should i do now?I have 2 months of summer break left and i feel like i don't have anything close to getting me a job."

I'm also kind of scared of all the ""burnout"" posts that appear here often, and how bad could that affect me.

6g2nui,38,2017-06-08,Wall Street Colleges. What you need to know... (X-Post from r/ApplyingToCollege),Dhhgdghrdg,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/6g2nui/wall_street_colleges_what_you_need_to_know_xpost/,"## ""I got a job at Goldman Sachs Investment​ Banking Division.""

That's what you want to say in 3-5 years, right? Making $125-$150k out of college sounds pretty good. But what does it take to get there as a high school student?

#**BASICS:**

Depending on how much you have learned about financial careers, you may know exactly or absolutely nothing about what Wall Street careers are. For most everyone they are ""stockbrokers"". If you take nothing from this post, I want you to know 99% of Wall Street employees are not ""stockbrokers"".

The real ""High-Finance"" (as douchy as it sounds) jobs coming out of college is in Investment Banking (IB), Sales &amp; Trading (S&amp;T), a few in Hedge Funds/Private Equity, and Management Consulting is also included at times. These are the ""Wall Street"" jobs.

If you want to learn more about careers, visitr/financialcareers, Wall Street Oasis, and Mergers and Inquisitions.

#**FOR COLLEGES:**

""Companies don't care about where I go to school as long as I have the degree right?""

NO, PRESTIGE MATTERS.

What college you attend will make or break which post-grad job you can get. The lower ranked you school is, the harder you will have to network to get into these types of jobs. You have less alumni connections, networking opportunities, and on-campus recruiting (OCR). Colleges are regarded at Targets, Simi-Targets, and Non-Targets.

#**RANKINGS (Subjective):**

Tier 1 (Super Targets) - Harvard, Stanford, Penn-Wharton, Princeton, Yale

Tier 2 (Targets) - MIT, Columbia, Duke, Dartmouth, U. Chicago, Northwestern, Georgetown, NYU-Stern, UC-Berkeley, Williams, Amherst, Michigan, UVA, Cornell, Brown

Tier 3 (Semi-Targets) - Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins, Emory, UNC, UCLA, USC, Notre Dame, WashU, Carnegie Mellon, Boston College, Rice, UT-Austin, Wake Forest, Indiana, others...

Higher tier means you have a better shot at getting into WS jobs, but also aligns with those programs being more difficult to get into. So when building your list of reach/match schools, look at these colleges. Students from a majority of other schools not listed will have a difficult time getting in.

-I probably forgot a few that should be on the list, my bad-

#**FINANCIAL AID:**

Top Schools are often cheaper than in-state for income under $100k. Don't be frightened by sticker price. Also, if you really do your research, consider taking out reasonable loans for a better schools. Going to the wrong school can ruin your chances from the very beginning.

#**MAJOR:**

""If I want a job in Finance, I should major in Finance?""

Not Always

Majority of the top schools do not offer Finance majors so most interested student major in economics. However, at the Super Targets, you can basically major in whatever you want as long as your GPA is high (one of the advantages of going to those schools). Is that fair? Debatable, but that is the system.

#**APPS:**

""I want to work on Wall Street so I will write my application to the econ/business program and tell them how much I want to work for The Goldman Sachs.""

Don't do this.

In general, academia does not look at WS in the best light so we will start with that. Additionally, it makes you seem shallow and just focusing on the money you will get after going to college not the actual college. Lastly, going into finance is very popular, so for school admissions, why would they let another application who just wants to do something that is already over represented (something like 30% of Harvard's class went into finance/consulting).

So, when applying ask is this a business program (Wharton) or general college (Harvard) I am applying to?

If a business program, obviously talk about wanting to do business just don't be generic. Make it something unique and different. Be interesting.

If general college, do not focus as much on your finance aspirations. Consider putting down another major besides econ unless you say you want to be a professor. Most of these colleges allow you to change your major easily, so you are not binded to your application. Matching your experiences to a more unique major and tell an interesting story, that will make you more competitive than the 1000s of potential econ majors. Once you are in, you are in.

#**IN HIGHSCHOOL:**

Obviously make good grades, SAT, etc.

Fact: Wall Street employers ask for SAT/ACT scores four years later. They matter

Try to get an internship the summer before Freshman year in your hometown or apply for the BAML (Bank of America) Leadership Summit. This let's you be more competitive for freshman internships in the future.

Practice debate/public speaking. There are a bunch of stock pitch competitions and case competitions that are won by former debate members. Speaking is the one skill that will transfer from HS to college.

Make a game plan. If you are not at the college you want to be, plan how and where to transfer. Get into the best program you can at a price you can afford with a high income after.

Edit your essays like you are giving them for God's judgement. They are what make and break you. Don't do it the night before.

Let me know if there are any questions.

I came in with no idea of what to do at this stage, went to an okay school and transferred up to a Semi-Target. Networked there with alumni and signed an offer to join Goldman Sachs in NY next summer in an accelerated process for sophomores. Crazy how fast things move."
6g2ogb,8,2017-06-08,[Work/Employment]Questions from a recent graduate about applying for jobs out of state: What works and what doesn't?,CDubulous,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/6g2ogb/workemploymentquestions_from_a_recent_graduate/,"Hello fellow Geographers!

I just recently graduated with my Bachelor's in GIS, and have started the perilous journey of applying for jobs. I am a bit overwhelmed, however, as I am applying for out of state jobs in hopes of relocating somewhere other than the midwest with my SO (preferably Oregon or Arizona area), and have had nothing but shitty luck and immediate rejections. I have some questions for those of you who have been in my shoes before post-graduation and overcame this hurdle of getting a foot in the door as well as tips you have on how to make this a smooth transition. But first, a little background to give you an idea of what I bring to the table: 

Aside from my GIS experience with coursework, over last year I have had internship with my University's Campus Planning department where I oversaw geodatabase management and assisted the GIS Technician with migrating various datasets and updating the campus webmap with a plethora of new features.

Outside of GIS and this internship, I am actively pursuing web development (I deployed my own portfolio website using Google App Engine and a knowledge of HTML and CSS), and frantically learning various scripting and programming languages, such as Python, Javascript, Java, and C++. I understand I'm probably in over my head here, as I'm trying to learn way too much in so little time, but I just want to have some knowledge of the different syntax of these languages in order to speak a little about them in interviews should the question arise.

I just graduated with my SO, and she is the one who wants to move out of the midwest (and I don't blame her). I have done quite a bit of research in applying for out of state jobs and saw various people saying to put you're planning to relocate on your resume, cover letter, etc., which I have done but to no avail. I do not require relocation assistance, and have some money saved up for moving costs and whatnot, fyi.

So to wrap it all up, fellow geographers, I ask that you share your expertise with me by answering these questions I have for you (granted you've been in similar situations or understand someone who has):

- What works and what doesn't when acquiring an out of state job with minimal experience?

- Is it better to move somewhere first then start applying for jobs? I'm willing to do this, however I feel like renters wouldn't approve an application unless I had a job or a source of income, but I may be wrong.

- Given my growing knowledge and resourcefulness with learning application development/scripting languages over the last few months, should I focus more on this to become a better asset to a company than GIS? (Basically, I don't want to be known as a glorified button pusher, which is sort of how I feel to companies now as they read my resume or cover letter with only GIS experience.)

I'll ask more questions should they arise. Any advice is greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Just graduated. Want to apply for jobs just about everywhere but here. Having no luck probably due to not being there. What works and what doesn't to get a job there. Thanks!"

I just graduated with my bachelors in finance. While obtaining my bachelors in finance, i spent two years interning at Northwestern Mutual where i have built a decent little book of business for a 22 year old. I only have my 2-15 currently, so I need to get my 7 and 66 at whichever firm I end up at. I just finished up my final semester as the #1 intern in my office (out of 30 interns) for sales in one of the top 3 offices in the country, and was ranked top 2% of interns nationwide. So yes, I understand how the business works, how to sell, how to build your business, and how shitty insurance is to sell. 

I have completely ruled out companies where your worth is measured by your insurance sales (NWM, Mass, NYL, etc) because honestly I think insurance is certainly necessary in MOST cases, but it should not be the solution to everything. 

Where I need guidance:
I have done countless hours of research on different companies id like to work for after I leave NWM, and I've even met with some advisors from other firms (Raymond James, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo) and heard their story in an attempt to see where I'd fit in the best. Based off of what I've heard, Morgan Stanley seems to be the move at this point, but I'm still not even close to 100% committed to that plan. Their 100k per month expectation is definitely a little frightening, but I know if i bust my ass, its definitely attainable. Base pay is huge for me, I'm completely independent from my parents, and I need consistent income to pay my bills. I am aware that higher base pay = higher expectations as far as monthly production, but I don't want to get canned if i have an off month. 

So here are my questions:
Which firms have the highest base pay?
Are there firms that help will help you out be providing orphan clients?
What are the benefits of working for a boutique firm vs a wire house? What are the expectations like at a boutique firm, and do you receive a base pay generally?

6g4mc7,2,2017-06-08,I am living in corporate housing for the summer but the internet is terrible. Can I pay for it myself?,theHoopster,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6g4mc7/i_am_living_in_corporate_housing_for_the_summer/,"Hello Reddit. I'm currently in corporate housing for a summer internship. The company is providing the housing but, due to a miscommunication, I am not in the same housing as the other interns. I'm in a much more corporate apartment meant for semi long-term visitors/relocated employees. While the other interns had to sign a lease and all, I had to fill our zero paperwork and am being giving the housing for free.

I am incredibly grateful for the housing but the internet is pretty terrible. It is incredibly inconsistent. At its peak, I get maybe 6Mb/s. However, that is incredibly rare. For most of the time I get &lt; .75Mb/s. As someone whose life is mainly internet based, I feel like I'm dying.

Part of me wants to go to HR since it is the company that pays for the service. I want to ask if they can contact the provider to see if there is an issue.

However, I feel it may just be best to pay for it myself the few months I'm here. My big question is, can I pay for internet while not being on the lease? My name may be on some documentation they have but I never had to sign anything.

Or would I just be better off calling a service provider, explain the situation, and see what they can do?

Thanks!"

6g5oyu,59,2017-06-08,When to take unpaid internships?,JaiX1234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6g5oyu/when_to_take_unpaid_internships/,"A search came back with old stuff.

Background:

I am a sophomore and my GPA dropped below 3.0 last semester after taking 18 credits(Passed). I know this will limit my future opportunities but I also understand I am not the best or smartest student. I had 4 Software developer intern interviews and they went well but they picked better qualified/experienced candidates. The couple IT positions all said I was not the right fit for them. My area is not a Tech area...therefore these positions are scarce.

Currently, I have a typical desk job at my College in Admissions(min.wage). I want to use my time more efficiently and on a real purpose. I organized a free C#, .NET, SQL, JavaScript, ADO.NET course with one of my professors for the summer. It is 4 hours a week till the fall. I am trying to be proactive and will come out with new skills by the end of the summer no matter what. I redo all my assignments from last semester + the countless other free websites everyone talks about. 

But I recently started thinking I should just offer to take an unpaid internship. Why not? What is there to lose? When I interviewed, I was a strong candidate but lacked the skills in the languages they wanted. Most of these companies in my area wanted candidates.....with a million languages. (my college teaches JAVA)

The Question:

Anyways, people have been telling me to not take unpaid internships and some will say I should. So it is coming down to Reddit and getting roasted for not being able to draw my own conclusion.

1. Money is NOT a problem
2. My current boss loves me, told me I had a secure job regardless if I get rejected and need to come back. She is looking out for me to make sure I am successful.
2. I am great with people, toxic abusive UNPAID internships I can sense a mile away and know when to leave/deal with. Excellent customer service + Interpersonal skills.
3. I want early experience with software development
4. I am desperate
5. What is there to lose?

Some of my professors that respect and value my assertiveness and ambition have told me to not undersell myself/skillsets. They believe I am worth more than being an unpaid intern at some random company. But friends have told me I should just take the unpaid internships because it is a last resort situation.

And to my main point as most of you guys can tell I am set on the idea of the unpaid internship unless otherwise, it is an absolutely horrible idea. Should I propose to an internship in the CV I am willing to do it for free? do I wait to see what they say first then propose? or should I just stop being desperate/stupid and try for Fall internships? Does anyone have experience with specifically aiming for unpaid internships?"

Also, will no prior internship experience hurt me? I wasn't able to get a summer internship this year because I'm travelling and won't be in my city during the summer. Would it be better to start at a smaller company first? I just feel like I'm running out of time to get an internship before I graduate! "

That said I need a little bit of input here....

Had my old piece-of-junk Casio graphing calculator die on me (suicided off the edge of my desk), so was needing a new calc. Stopped in at my college to say hi/thanks to one of my instructors from this past semester, and found a note pinned to the bulletin board about someone selling their TI-89 Titanium for $40 bucks. A quick bit of googling showed me this was a pretty decent price, so I called up the fellow selling it and grabbed it.

Been playing around with it with some Calc problems from this past semester, and it seems like a pretty nice piece of kit. That said, I feel a bit overwhelmed by it. I'm about to take a look-see at the downloadable programs over at the TI site, and I've checked on a few tutorials here and there, but I get the distinct feeling that I'm only scratching the surface of this sleeping giant.

As someone who is moving from a (craptastic) scientific calc w/graphing added on as an afterthought, what would you recommend as good learning material for someone who wants to get the most out of his new TI-89 Titanium and go from ""toddler-crawling"" mode to ""track-and-field-runner"" mode with it?"

--------------------------------------------------

**The Dairy of John Doe**

Hello there, my name is Kane Jeffersen, one of Thomas Matherson's lead assistants and Second-in-Charge of the John Doe Project, as it has been labelled since Thomas officially declared this endeavor two months ago. Since then, we have delved into every record and file we have on World War One and found almost nothing that would seem to be a reference to a “John Doe” found on the battlefield on either side of the conflict. It was most a complete loss until Thomas instructed an intern to start looking into other major conflicts. It was by complete luck they she found a battered diary in a lock box containing some old photos and other paraphernalia. Unfortunately, the photos were too faded to tell what they were depicting, however the diary had the initials “J.D.” painted on the cover. 

The contents of the diary shocked us all and Thomas seemed to be affected the most, as he has taken a short leave of absence, handing the task of describing the contents of the dairy to you. It still makes us queasy reading them, but I have gathered enough strength to record this for you and anyone else who finds these tapes in the future. Not every entry is horrifying, at least to us, but we'll  let you determine what you consider disturbing.

I'll begin with the first entry, dated September 1, 1945

*Dear Reader,*

*I am glad someone has found this, hopefully someone who can help rescue me. It has felt like a lifetime since I set foot on solid, somewhat familiar ground. Alas, I was not transported back to my home country, nor my original time period. My captor advised me of the date – September 1, 1945. Dear Lord! I would be 49 if I had aged all during my time in captivity. However, that does not appear to be the case, a brief glimpse in a shop's glass front show me looking as young as when I died. My captor's “home” is a strange place, time is stopped there, nothing ages or wilts and dies. Everything stays as fresh as the day it was bought there, unless he wants it to die.*

*It was not long after my first attempt at contact, a letter, disappeared from my hand, that my captor explained a little more about my situation. He explained to me that he is a historian from a place where technology allows his people to travel when and wherever they want. His main area of expertise is wars and conflicts. He has been using his technology to travel to all the major conflicts throughout our history and silently observing them. He also mentioned that I am not his first captive. He captured one warrior or solider from each conflict and fitted them with a device that allows him to watch and record what those soldiers see from their own eyes. This just outright shocked me, especially when he advised that they only tended to last as long as the conflict did. During the conflicts where one side or the other was more superstitious, the body seemed to be avoided during any clean-up that occurred. The people finding the body sensed something was wrong about it and it was left to rot where it lay.*

*I didn't feel any relief when he went on to explain that he has improved this recording device over time and it seems more reliable now. I knew that meant that I was his next experiment. I didn't get a chance to react, before I was sedated and operated on. Before I fell asleep, I saw other cages with dead bodies in then, dozens of them, going as far back as the Aztecs at least. There were probably more cages, but I collapsed completely before reaching the operating area. When I woke up, there was a small ache in my left eye. When I was conscious enough to understand him, my captor explained that there is a tiny camera connected to my eye that will allow him to see what I do.*

*I wanted to know more, but before I could respond I vanished from the room as he called out*

“Welcome to Germany, 1939. The beginning of World War Two. Try not to get yourself killed.”

*It's only been a few hours since I arrived here, but I managed to get myself a diary and a pen as you can see and hide myself away somewhere quiet long enough at least to write this entry. My first thoughts are “World War Two?”. What event could bring the the whole world into a conflict a second time. I was lucky enough to find a shop where the owner knew English, as I was not taught other languages in school. That doesn't solve the issue of me not being able to understand anyone else though. Guess I will have to lay low and see what I can discover.*

*I am lucky I guess that I can write this dairy and he'll be able to see me writing it. I will assume he doesn't want to be spotted, so he will remain back at his laboratory at least for now. Time to explore and learn, I guess. I doubt I'll be getting out of here until I find out what he wants to know about this conflict. I am unsure when I'll be able to write again.*

*John Doe.”*

This first entry alone has let us theorize on a few things. Our first theory is that his captor is not from Earth, which seems the most far fetched, but we can't rule anything out yet. Our second theory is that the captor is from Earth's distant future, where technology has advanced where time travel is possible. This is just as far fetched, but based on the fact that John Doe has not mentioned any alien-like features about the captor, we are all assuming that he is humanoid in appearance to come across as one. 

I'll spare the some of the details of some of the entries following the first one. John describes in subsequent entries about discovering the cause of the war, the instigator and the nations involved at the beginning. He is lucky enough to not be noticed when he is teleported to each of the locations where the major decisions and turning points of the war took place. He was there at the attack on Pearl Harbour, the bombing of Japan and the surrender of the Axis forces, declaring the end of the war. At each of the events, he was almost front and centre, yet went completely unnoticed by everyone. Once the surrender was announced and the declaration of peace declared he was teleported back to the captor's place.

By the reading of the last entry, we all were all shook up and felt the deepeest sympathy for John. It mut have been a horrible ordeal to witness all the events and deaths that occurred. It is a miracle he survived it all, or something that his captor did to him that made him more tolerant to death and violence. His entries clearly display emotion, as this next entry I will read to shows, dated August 7, 1945. 

*“Dear Reader.*

*This war has been a long and harrowing affair for the entire human race and I do surely wish it ends soon .It seems that Germany has surrendered, which has put an ending to the bloodshed across Europe, however the Japanese government is stubborn and stupid in my opinion, not agreeing to the terms of the surrender.* 


*I am currently hiding in a basement with a few Japanese families. The bombs starting falling yesterday and I dare say there isn't much of this city left standing. Beyond that, from what I could understand from the orders given by the president of the United States a few days ago (yes, I was there too), these bombs will do more than just ruin buildings and kill from the explosion. Apparently these is a material contained in them that is toxic to all life forms when highly concentrated. I understand that drastic times call for drastic measures, but this is severely extreme!*

*Also, over the multiple times that I have been transported between events thus far, I have discovered one thing. I am only noticeable to civilians, I appear to be invisible to anyone directly or indirectly involved in the conflict on their side. Only the truly innocent can see me, those who are just bystanders to this horrible atrocity. I am glad I am not completely invisible, otherwise I would surely be dead by now. I have been dropped right in the middle of some many battles, it's harrowing to think about all the life lost. Every time I find myself lost in the middle of a town or village, I am called over by one person or another into their hiding spots. I am forever grateful for these people, they have risked their lives to try and save mine. I am a complete stranger, presumably of their country (at least in their eyes), and they treat my like one of their family. I can never understand them,nor do they understand me, but they recognize the appreciation in my eyes and gestures.I wish I could thank them with words every time, but I remain silent to prevent the confusion as much as possible. Also, because we all fear being found, that much I understand.*

*I do hope that this attack on Japan will find end it all, I feel so tired and these families can't take much more. Their children are scared and crying, the parents don't know how to console the and no-one slept last night. We are tired and hungry, we can't much last longer.* 

*Alas, I must leave this diary here as I fear I will be taken from this place as soon as the terms of surrender are agreed upon. It won't be found if Take it with me back to the cage, as I don't know when I will return if ever. I hope it survives the blasts.*

*John Doe.”*

That is the last entry in the diary, no doubt because it didn't take long after the bombings for Japan to surrender unconditionally. Unfortunately, there are no more descriptions of his captor or his place of captivity, so we are unable to help locate him at this point. Our research continues and has already helped determine when the photos attached the diary were taken. It seems that they were shot a few days before the bombings on Hiroshima. One of Japanese colleagues help to decipher the faded text of the back. They are all of John with each of the families he was hiding with during the attack. It seems he as able to convey his name of John Doe clearly enough for the families to write on the photos. 

Another disconcerting matter that arose is that John never found out the fates of the people that took him, good or bad. This must be weighing on his mind after the end of each of encounter. Events such as war can bring even the estranged people closer together. We have assigned a team with the specific task of researching and hunting down information on each family mentioned on the photos. There are also family names mentioned through the diary entries, names of other people he has shared the horrors of war with. They are also been researched.

We hope to find out as much as possible and hope to contact any surviving relatives. Meanwhile, the rest of the team will continue to search records of other wars, as we have a hunch that he tried to reach people when he resurfaced during those conflicts. 

It may take some time to find more information, but the team is working flat out and I will arrange to provide updates as soon as it become possible."

I am currently in my first week of a summer internship for a large company working as an IT admin. My responsibilities include setting up networking equipment, managing user accounts, resolving tickets for offsite users, etc. I have good deal of knowledge in these areas, not from working experience but from self-study. When I am asked to carry out these duties and other more technical tasks, I can do them with ease and with little help, other than assistance with aspects of technology I do not have experience in. 

Yesterday, towards the end of my shift, I was trying to open up an obligatory HR training course and the pop-up page for the course would not load. First I thought I should check browser settings to see if pop-ups were given proper permissions to load content; they were.  Then I figured just to try it in another browser. The device at my desk is a Windows 10 machine with IE, Chrome, and Firefox installed. So I tried it in Firefox; it was a no go. Without going further with troubleshooting and messing with settings I'm not sure I have permission to, I asked my boss who sits behind me to see if he knows what the issue is. He comes over to my desk, and opens the page in IE and says, ""Sometimes webpages don't like other browsers."" The training course worked like a charm. I then went about my business without mentioning this incident again. Since then, I have been stewing and anxious about this little thing. As an IT person, I should have known how to resolve the issue, but I couldn't at the time. I can do more technical and advanced things, but this little webpage issue stumped me. I am worried that my boss now thinks I am incompetent as an IT person. I have not confronted my boss about it. 

As an IT boss of an intern, would this concern you if you were in his position? Should I be worried about my boss possibly not giving more responsibility because of this?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

6g9kr8,54,2017-06-09,TIFU By dropping the cake at a wedding,RivyGucci,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6g9kr8/tifu_by_dropping_the_cake_at_a_wedding/,"A few years back, My girlfriend (now ex) and I had a few jobs over the summer that we figured would earn us a good amount of money in a short period of time (around $750-900 each). The plan was to go dog sit for a family friend of my ex while doing catering jobs for the next two weeks. My ex also had an internship close by so the majority of the work would be done by none other than yours truly. 
 
We get to the house and I meet the family for the first time. The owners were an older couple, probably in their fifties, who were going on vacation and wanted us to watch their corgi for them. They were like vegan hippies in a way. Only ate organic shit, no meat. Their fridge looked like the inside of a forest...if that paints a better picture.They told us about the dog, what she likes, doesn’t like. When/what to feed her, when to go on walks, etc. 
 
So after all the bullshitting, the couple leaves  and my ex and I settle in. Time goes by and we have our first catering job which was a wedding reception inside the banquet room of a museum about a half hour away. We get there, both dressed accordingly, and spend the next three hours setting up. 
 
Right before the event begins, the manager comes up to me and this ditzy, loopy, older gentleman server and told us we are tasked with moving the wedding cake from the front of the reception to the kitchen to be cut and plated when the time came. I was nervous , this being my first catering job and all, but it’s a cake. How hard could it be?
 
The reception so far is going well. I’m doing a great job running food, making sure everyone is happy, and following directions from the managers with ease. Before you know it, the time comes and we have to move the cake. Now the cake wasn’t too elaborate, just a three layer cake with your generic wedding shit riddled on it. The table it was on was about waist-high tall and circular. John (the older server) and I approached the cake. Being cautious, I looked under table to make sure everything was sturdy. I wiggled each leg and they are as solid as could be (not a good idea). I get back up to begin the moving process. 
 
We tried to lift the the cake up from the bottom but couldn’t get our fingers under it without getting frosting on our hands. Me, thinking outside the box, told John we should just lift and carry the whole table to the kitchen. He nodded and we began to lift.
 
All of a sudden, the legs collapsed and the table tips over. The cake slid off and...SPLAT! It’s completely destroyed and the whole reception of 300+ people are staring in silent shock. I guess when I was fucking around with the legs, I must have loosened something by accident.
 
The Bride began to cry and you could see the smoke coming out of the Grooms ears.I slowly walked out of frame and John, the son of a bitch that he was, started licking the frosting off his fingers all while not being phased in the slightest bit of what just happened. 
 
I apologized profusely to everyone. I was overwhelmed with shame by potentially ruining a wedding. Some people were very understanding and sympathetic , some, not so much. My ex, however, wasn’t too comforting, but then again, she never really was. 
 
Towards the end, the Groom came up and made his speech per tradition. 
 
He goes on about, “ How much he loves cake and how, in college, he dreamed about eating it on his wedding day…” 
 
“Top 10 worst nights of my life.”, I thought to myself.
 
The next day the catering company contacts me and basically says,
 
“Don’t come back for anymore events! You’re done!” 
“You almost ruined the company's reputation!” 
 
I asked them about John and they say, “He has been working here forever and that it wasn’t his fault.” 
 
Dicks.
 
For the remainder of the two weeks I just chilled with the corgi, cooked a shit ton of meat, mowed the grass, and accepted the fact that out of all this time, I’ll only be taking home $40...
 
**TL;DR: Was a server at a wedding and was tasked with moving the cake. I dropped the cake. Potentially ruined the wedding, got fired and missed out on good money.**

I am currently a student at university and will obtain a BS degree in Computer Information Systems within the next year to year and a half. My current Bachelor's program is in the College of Business at my school, so I take a lot of business courses as well (accounting, finance, marketing, management). 

I am currently interning at a good company doing Desktop Support (Help Desk) and also did a previous internship doing roughly the same thing (troubleshooting, hardware, tickets, all that good stuff...). So I have 2 good internships with very reputable companies. I am hoping to gain more experience, but this is where I am at now.

My question is, after I obtain my degree in Computer Information Systems (which is considered a business degree at my univ) how to a transition out of the ""Support"" roles and into a more ""business"" like path. I've talked to the other techs at my company and they all said there's lots of potential to grow... but you basically keep growing into higher level ""support"" roles. I know it's good to have experience, but is this a good place to start if I want to further down the road get into the more business side of things (like Architect, Manager, Director, etc.)  Should I still be trying to pursue the experience I am getting now and try to grow, or should I be look for other types of IT jobs once my internship ends at the end of the summer.

I am kind of new to all this, so any comments or advice will help out tremendously! 

Thanks ~~~"

A new intern was tasked to check where all the computers and printers are on two of our departments. The departments moved to different floors and were told to just move themselves over and let everything else stay at their place.

Buuuuuuut as you can maybe guess, they cut the cable ties, unplugged computer/keyboard/mouse/phone and moved into their new floor. My boss was enraged, called the bosses of those departments and quoted the content of the email again followed by *is that so hard to understand? Now go and put everything back where you took it from, my men wont do that!!!*

This is when new intern was given the task to go and check. Each computer and printer has a sticker on them with a number. He was given a layout of the floors and which computer and printer needed to be in which room. He was not told to move them to their correct place, just list where they are now. We would do the rest if necessary.

So far so good, he gets going and we go on with our usual daily routines. Suddenly the phone rings....

----------------------------

Players:

$CIT - Dumbfounded me

$TNI - The New Intern

$Boss - Well my boss...

-------------------------------

&gt;$CIT: Hello, you are speaking with $CIT, how can I help you?

&gt;$TNI: Hey it's me, there is a printer and it doesn't have a sticker on it. How do I get the IP of it?

&gt;$CIT: Use the interface on it, it has to say ""Network Settings"" or so somewhere around those options. Just click your way through it.

&gt;$TNI: Nope, tried that already. The interface isn't doing anything.

&gt;$CIT: Did you turn it off and on again? *I hate to ask that*

&gt;$TNI: Tried that too, same result.

&gt;$CIT: Is the ethernet-cable plugged in?

&gt;$TNI: Yes.

&gt;$CIT: I will scan the subnet of the floor, screenshot the result of active devices and then you unplug it and we scan again.

Said and done, both scans show same result.

&gt;$CIT: Ok, I'm coming over.

I walk down 3 floors, through a long hallway and up 2 two floors to arrive at sight. $TNI shows me the printer and I verify that it is really not doing a thing. I try the reboot too...nada. I start the computer that is in the same room as the printer to check if I can get something out of that with the COM-port that is for some reason still attached although it is on ethernet.

----------------------

Note: Don't try to make sense of it, there is a bottomless list of things that shouldn't be there, but are there, because of frequent staff-changes and nobody knowing what the previous person did.

---------------------------

I try to log in to my account...nada. No connection to the domain. I check the cables, all plugged in. I log in as the local admin and check the network-settings....all good.

&gt;$CIT: Look, you stay here, I go back and check the patch panel and switches in our server room. *makes mental note of patch panel number I have to check*

2 floors down, long hallway, 3 floors up....

The server room is can only be accessed through the office of $Boss. As I enter our department, I hear that all my coworkers are on the phone, which is odd. Usually quiet at our department. I walk in $Boss' office, go to the server room and check the patch panel....all good. Checking all switches...all good.

Rather confused I go out of the server room, trying to approach $Boss to tell him about the issue. I see the other ones have arrived in his office too.

&gt;$Boss: $CIT, tell me what you did in the server room. We cannot connect to any of those devices on those two floors.

&gt;$CIT: Um...I just checked the patch panels and switches. All goody, it seems. *explain to him to the rest of the story*

&gt;$Boss: Gotta be something $TNI did...*waves at the other ones to follow him*...$CIT, you stay here, we go check out what the issue is.

&gt;$CIT: But how can he mess something up by just documenting things?

&gt;$Boss (while walking out of the office): Don't know, but we will find out.

While I wait for one of them to return, I get several more calls about them not getting any network-connection. Frustrated and angry callers. I just give them the info that it is being worked on and hang up.

Finally one of them comes back, just shaking his head and reports to me that $TNI did unplug some cables and supposedly plugged them right back in after he found out where they lead. That wasn't a part of his given job. He managed to create a ring between two switches that are on their floor, so the switches were playing an awesome game of data-ping-pong.

Just How? and Why? were the things I was wondering about...

---------------------------

TL;DR: Intern is supposed to document which pc/printer is in which room of two departments. Manages to unplug cables for no good reason and create a ring while plugging it back in.

--------------------

Yes, this intern is still around will be for about another half a year.

Yes, he has done more things that made us facepalm."

I'm currently a part time receptionist and a full time position has recently been available at my job as a recruiter (salary based not commission) (going to high schools and telling students about our college). 

I applied for the position and there is a high likelihood I will get it since I've been working there for a while. My question is, do you think this will affect my ability to get a CS job right after graduating? I'm not sure if it will look bad to stay at the full time position only for 6 months and then leave for a developer job. Of course, this is assuming I get hired right after graduation. basically if I get this position I will not be doing an internship in the fall.

 I  believe I have nothing to lose since if I get the full time position I would be able to look for a CS job more comfortably after graduating. Any tips on how I should prepare in the meantime since I won't be doing an internship? What technology should I focus on that is emerging? Thanks!

At the moment, I'm an IT intern (and getting paid very handsomely for it) at a very large and well-known company and have had a job doing IT at a doctor's office for the better part of a year. Unfortunately, I do not have any certifications. 

I absolutely love the idea of computer forensics (and have noticed that my school actually offers either a cert/Masters for it, but not sure if I want to go through more school for it since I'm ready to be done). Security is also very interesting to me, but it's a very broad field that I'm not entirely sure which part of security I'd like to be in if I had the opportunity. 

What are the positions I can expect with my background? Just helpdesk positions? I know of someone who graduated from my university w/ the same major, and went off to Microsoft as a BI, but I don't think that's a super reasonable expectation for myself.

Sorry if this post is all over the place! Any help would be appreciated."

6gak5p,4,2017-06-09,Help deciding between tech company and hedge fund,cvspharmacy123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6gak5p/help_deciding_between_tech_company_and_hedge_fund/,"I'm having a hard time deciding between accepting a full-time offer at a tech company which recently IPO'd and a hedge fund. The tech company is one which I had previously interned at. I really enjoyed working there, and thought I was given very meaningful and interesting projects that helped develop my skills as a software developer. The compensation package they offer is very generous (~130k total in Seattle area). 

The hedge fund, on the other hand, is something I am extremely interested in. Having worked as an intern in big companies and startups, I am really interested in how working at a hedge fund might differ. Their total compensation is also insane (~160 + benefits like assisting with housing). The only issue is that the position I was offered was in operations. Now as a CS grad, I know it is generally not recommended to ever start working in operations. But, at this company it is seen as a short-term transitory role that allows me to branch into other areas of engineering within 8-12 months. For the first year, however, I would mainly be doing operations work, being on call a lot of the time, and having to take many night shifts, with traditional software projects done on the side. 

Given all this, what do you recommend doing? If it wasn't for the operations role, I would take the hedge fund offer in a heartbeat just because I want to diversify my experiences and see what it's like working at a hedge fund. My biggest concern is that taking the operations role would be a huge risk that would assume my ability to otherwise grow as a software engineer for that year might be hindered. On the other hand, the compensation is pretty insane, and I would be able to change into a software engineering role at that prestigious firm within a year. I've also generally been quite interested in seeing what sysadmin type of work is like. Any thoughts?

So I am a university student and have zero friends, not a single person I can call to hang out with. I was the prototypical kid in high school who was bullied heavily, tried to latch onto several different groups of people. Ultimately, I always ended up being everyone else's last option. I got tired of this and withdrew from everyone and added social anxiety to my laundry list of detriments. A story unfortunately many people here can probably relate to. I just finished my junior year and I attained a full-time 9-5 internship for this summer with a very good company at their corporate headquarters. Great right? First day of the internship I show up and there's about 50 other interns, we are all funneled into a room by human resources. We do an ice breaker activity that involves introducing yourself, your major, your university etc. I'm really impressed with the diversity of schools represented. Universities from all over the country. Then we take a tour of the companies enormous campus and do some other activities. 

In my head I am getting excited. I am telling myself wow this is it, I'm going to meet people I have things in common with and I am have an opportunity to make some friends. At the end of that day were funneled back into this room and told our managers would be coming to pick us up. A couple managers show up and pick up groups of interns, so I have my fingers crossed that I won't be the only intern in my department. Reason being, I know if someone is basically forced to interact with me my chances of making friends increases. There's only 5 of us left in the room and a manger eagerly enters the room and communicates 4 names.......... none of which are mine. A few minutes pass and my manager shows up, there is no confusion because I am the only person in the room that isn't an hr person.

I try and stay positive and tell myself everything will work out. Fast-forward to the next day and it's lunch time. I decide I am going to go to lunch a little early at 11:55 as I don't want to miss out on an opportunity to socialize with the other interns. I get to the cafeteria and it's not real busy. I get my food and have a seat on the end of one of dozens of empty tables that seat about 8 people stationed right in the middle of the cafeteria. I am slowly eating my food and gradually interns start to show up for lunch. 
Everyone is arriving in groups that vary from 2 or 3 to 7 or 8. Fast forward 10 minutes and everyone has their food and is seated. I watch some of the groups sit together while others consolidated with other groups at one table. Meanwhile I am still sitting by myself paralyzed by the thought of having to go over and join some of the other interns. I keep looking up in the direction of the other tables waiting to make eye contact with someone so they can wave and tell me to come over and join them. It never happens as everyone is too engulfed in the conversations they're having. It's almost like I don't even exist. I finish my food get up and walk back across campus to my department.

This almost exact scenario has played out every work day for the last 4 weeks. It's now at the point were I'll see other interns walking around campus through the hallways and I'll prepare to say hello and one of two things will happen. Either a generic exchange consisting of a half smile but ultimately nothing else as we move in opposite directions. Or I'll prepare to say hello, and when I try to make eye contact the person silently walks past me with their head down or looking in the other direction like I don't even exist. It's the same old story...."

I had previous programming experience (C# and Java for small android apps) and in the past month began writing web ui automation test cases for our regression tests and am really excelling at it. I am loving my work!

But when i accepted the job it seemed that other ""entry-level"" QA positions in the area paid around $15-$20/hr and my friend doing a paid internship at another company is paid $20/hr.

The inital offer was an underwhelming $10/hr which i said i needed to think about and called back later to counter-offer at 15$ and we settled at $12/hr.  

Since then i learned that there are only two employees at the company are paid that low, myself, and the manual QA engineer on our team who has no coding experience.

I applied last month to the internship that my friend did and had an interview that went really well, but i haven't heard much from them other than my friend saying ""management takes forever to free up spots"" it may be 2 or 3 months before i get a call back from them.

I understand that i am getting a lot of training, and it is my first job in the field. But i feel that i have proven my worth to the company and deserve to be compensated for my work.

TL:DR I make the same as the manual tester, should i ask for a raise at my 6 month mark? How much should i ask for? Or should i wait to hear back from the company i interviewed at?

Overall glad to be out.

I put my notice in to that job once I had signed employment papers for a new position of being a food stylist, with much better pay causing me to quickly jump on board. How exciting! Soon come to find out that the offer was too good to be true and it was only a freelance position and not full time like it had been presented; I have not been contacted for a freelance opportunity since being hired, even after contacting the company myself. 

So now I have been out of work for almost a month and a half. I am looking to no longer be a line cook but that is all I am seen as. Wanting better pay, the ability to afford proper health insurance and a better work/life balance has become very important to me.

I feel like I'm getting paid decently to sit around and fiddle with technologies without producing much value, make a few small bug fixes to alleviate a negligible load from other developers, etc. All in all, I'm kind of a well-paid wallflower. 

I plan to express my thoughts in a tactful way to my manager at some point and try to get some more interesting work. From how things are, it seems like my manager isn't going to try and prod me to do much so I'll have to take the initiative on my own.

Thoughts on how I should proceed?

I have proof he's my dog, but roommate won't listen to reason.",c0raline,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6gcu0g/dog_custody_i_have_proof_hes_my_dog_but_roommate/,"This might be really long but bless anyone who reads this because I haven't stopped crying for 3 days. I need help.

So I live in Oklahoma. I've had the same roommate for about 3 years. His dog also lived there. I've always been a dog lover but at that time I had never had my own dog. I talked to my roommate about getting one. I figured it couldn't hurt because we already had one dog. But he said no. I begged him for WEEKS. I looked at dog shelter websites and craigslist pets and I would show him all the potential dogs I could get, hoping he would budge.

Eventually a coworker told me his dogs had an accidental litter and I could have one of those puppies for free. Roommate said no. I begged him to come with me just to look at them, and finally he said we could just look. I ended up taking one home.

I spent the next few months reading every dog book there was. I named my puppy Rory. I bought his bed and toys and leash and collar. I crate trained him and taught him all the basic tricks and how to properly walk on a leash. He slept in my bed with me. I took him to the vet and got him micro-chipped and got his rabies shot. I took him to get fixed when he was 6 months old and made monthly payments on his puppy health plan. I have all the vet records that show when I took him in and that I am the owner. My roommate's name is kind of on those as well as a secondary contact person, but they put his last name as mine because they thought we were married. His microchip has my name and phone number on it.

My roommate is a dog person, his mom is retired and she breeds and shows dogs. They have like 10 of them. They converted their garage into a giant dog room. It's really nice. As such, his parents have always dog-sat for us when we needed them to. So Rory would visit their house sometimes.

The past year has been really busy for me. I just graduated in May but I had to do 18 hours this past semester and I'm doing my internship and working full time while I take 2 online classes this summer. I am getting married in 2 weeks and moving to Seattle with my husband in July. My roommate graduated before me, and money isn't really an issue for him so he works part time as a bartender. 

Since he has so much free time, he has been spending a lot of time with Rory. He visits his parents a lot when he gets bored, and he takes Rory with him without asking. I never really had a problem with it. I would rather him have that time being socialized instead of being home alone waiting for me to get home. I've honestly been really thankful because many times they would come home and Rory would have his flea medication on his fur or the hair around his face trimmed. I never took offense to it. I am perfectly capable of taking care of my own dog, but they would just do it before I got the chance.

SO HERE'S THE THING. Like I said, I'm moving to Seattle in July. My roommate has approached me and said he wants to keep Rory. Of course I said no, but he is arguing with me about this saying that he takes better care of him. He says that he loves Rory and can't imagine him not being around. He said ""When you leave, you'll have your husband but I won't have anybody. Rory is all I have.""

Which is true, but no matter what I say to him, he thinks that he is better suited to take care of Rory because he and his family are dog people and he doesn't want to separate Rory from his dog, etc.

I can't make him listen to reason. I don't know what to do. I feel guilty and selfish fighting for my own damn dog. I had to beg to get him in the first place and now I have to beg to keep him?

Yeah, I haven't been home a lot this past semester. But once we get to Seattle, I will have no school, no wedding to plan, no friends or family to visit, and one job if any job at all. Rory is my baby and I can't imagine not having him.

Do I need to get a lawyer? I am scared to stir the pot too much because my roommate is also my wedding photographer and I don't want him to get mad and refuse to shoot my wedding. He's offered a significant discount if I let him keep Rory which honestly just makes me sick because Rory isn't worth a dollar amount to me.

What do I do here??? Pets are property, right? I have solid proof that he is my property, but would it really be better for Rory to stay here with him? Am I being selfish by taking him away from his sister-dog and to a new place?

UPDATE: I printed out all of Rory's vet records, confirmed all of his microchip info and printed that as well. I contacted my old coworker who gave me Rory and asked him if he had any paperwork or anything that would prove he gave Rory to me. I made him a vet appointment tomorrow to make sure he is current on all his shots and after the vet I'm taking him to my parents house. Thanks for everyone's advice. If my roommate refuses to do our wedding photography I have plenty of friends who are amateur photographers so we will figure it out."

My first and only actual job experience was working fast food at Taco Bell for about 6 months. This goes way back starting Jan 2015 til the end of June 2015. Yes, I understand that this is a rather large 'gap' of 2 years as I have not worked since. I'll be honest in that I was fortunate enough to not NEED to work throughout university since I took out loans and my parents helped me out as well. I was unable to get any internships as well, especially for this summer =(.

If anything, I've used this time to really focus on school. I'm going to graduate next year in with a B.S. in IT. However, this brings up the issue of whether or not I should include my ""old"" work experience on my resume?

One friend told me that it's way too big of a gap to include it. Another friend told me that fast food experience isn't even worth putting on a resume. However, the biggest reason I put it on my resume is obviously because it's my first and only work experience, plus the experience was for 6 months, which shows at least some dedication I think.

**Bonus:** Does volunteer experience have a ""too old"" tag to it too? 

I have volunteer experience from my high school years (2012-2014), and also my most recent one in college, but that too ended in 2015. Friend said I'm crazy to even put anything I did in H.S. years as it was WAYYY too old. I'm looking to completely remove my volunteer section once I get enough work experience to fill up my resume.

Any help is appreciated!

6gec4j,3,2017-06-10,[CAN] Employment law - clawback on CPA fees,canadianhealth,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6gec4j/can_employment_law_clawback_on_cpa_fees/,"Canada, British Columbia

Hi Reddit,

Long story, but I will try to keep it as concise as possible.

Started with an accounting firm (big 4) in May 2014 and part of the first couple years is that they pay for your CPA dues/fees as you work towards getting your CPA. Fast forward two years, the firm paid approximately $8,000 for my CPA modules over the past approx. 2 years, and I was scheduled to write the CPA exam in September 2016. Unfortunately I had to withdraw from the exam due to medical reasons. If I had written the exam, I would have been finished with my CPA.

Fast forward to now, I have recently left that firm, and they have sent me a letter demanding repayment of all my CPA fees over the past 2-3 years, totaling around $10,000. The letter refers to the L&amp;D policies, which do state that if you leave before completion of your CPA, you are required to pay back 100% of the costs incurred. However, I am wondering if there is a way that the clawback policy will be unenforceable. 

My thoughts are as follows:

1. My friend who wrote the CPA exam in September 2016 and received his CPA, left the firm in March, and was not subject to any clawback. Am I able to argue that the firm received more service/time out of me from their investment? I had approx. 6 months more service time as I also did a summer internship. It hardly seems fair that I would be required to pay back $11,000 because I was unable to write my exam due to a medical emergency, and that the only difference between my friend and I is that he wrote the exam. The large majority of the fees are over 2 years old, is there any limit on the clawback period?

2. Am I able to argue that the $11,000 is not a genuine estimate of the firm's cost/loss as a result of my breach? The only cost to the firm as a result on me not completing my CPA with the firm is that my name wasn't published in the CPA magazine with the firm's name below. Again, this hardly seems fair. The estimate loss for not having their name in the magazine is no where near $11,000. Also, any argument to be made about inequality of bargaining power?

3. Am I able to argue inconsistency of them clawing-back CPA fees? A coworker who wrote the September 2016 left the firm shortly after, and did not pass the exam, therefore not getting his CPA. He was never asked to repay. 

4. The situation may be further complicated by the fact that I am currently living/working in the US. If I don't pay the amount, would they be able to collect on me from the US? 

I just wanted to get some initial thoughts on this. I have a consultation scheduled with an employment lawyer for next week. I do understand that policies are policies, but we are in the position that we are almost required to agree to any policy they have in regards to the CPA fees. I don't think anyone who goes through the CPA program at the firm is aware of the policies they're subjected to.

My hope is that I have enough of a legal argument to the point where I can go back to the firm and tell them that I will not pay for reasons x, y, and z. I hope that with backing of a lawyer that they will not further pursue it, or, at the very least accept a much lower settlement amount. I imagine that there would be significant legal fees incurred by them in trying to collect on me from the US, so I'm hoping that they will not try to collect the full amount and accept a lower settlement.

Thanks in advance, happy to clarify anything!

tl;dr Left Big 4 before completing my CPA, they're now trying to collect $11,000 related to CPA fees/dues they paid. Trying to figure out if the clawback is enforceable by them."

My reasons for ending it are, well, the usual I suppose. For starters, I have no one. My family hates me and I have no real close friends in my life anymore. My boyfriend(?) has constantly been flirting with other girls online and possibly in real life. He is a compulsive liar and I have given him so many chances to stop lying. He really is/was my only happiness. I know that's bad to do, but I couldn't help it. He made me feel like I could get through anything. 

I have really bad anxiety as well. Never formally diagnosed I suppose, but I was perscribed Zoloft to help ""come out of my shell"" as my doctor put it. I think that medicine fucked me up more than I was. I did quit it cold turkey a few years ago, even though it did help somewhat.

My anxiety has made it impossible for me to do what I love in life. I was going to college to be a doctor, but after the first day of clinicals I dropped every class. I couldn't get through the one on one patient interactions. I cried myself to sleep so many nights after that. I did finish a two year degree in legal assisting and an internship, which was hell... but I have been terrified to find a job after my experiences with my internship and the clinical. 

I'm basically a waste of space. I've tried to be happy and positive and I try to push myself to get over this anxiety but I can't. Hell, I get nervous and shaky when I try to talk on the mic while playing online video games. I am so stupid.

And I really love my boyfriend. Even though I've caught him lying to me and others about the most irrelevant shit... I love him and I don't want to end our relationship. I want to fix it but I don't even know if it's possible.

Which is why I may as well end myself. I'm scared of dying but I'm more scared of living at this point."

However, 2 things that stood out were that everyone had a higher degree than bachelor's - masters or PhD, and the majority of the people there worked on areas such as computer vision, machine learning, or control systems. On the other hand, I was in the minority that worked on embedded software and a little bit of electronics design, both of which I really enjoyed.

My question is, what should I focus on during my masters (and possibly PhD if necessary) to raise my chances of eventually working at a place that works on cutting edge robotics? Would I have to start moving more into control systems, computer vision, machine learning etc.?  
Also would attempting to go to a US based school for my masters be a good idea?  
And finally would a PhD be necessary? I see many degree programs that offer funding if you are able to gain entry into the masters+PhD program, but none for degree programs that are just masters only.

So i've taken the summer off to focus on life and family issues going on. Currently I work at a national retail store that may sound similar to K.J. Marx, and I do promotions on the side for extra cash. (however it is extremely inconsistent.) I've been putting out applications and cover letters and calling around to different places. I've worked to tailor my resume and cover letters to each job I apply for. I also try to use similar words and phrases from the job adds in the resume/cover letter I submit.

**Basically I'm looking for suggestions on hopefully full-time jobs I could do.**

My skillset right now is currently:

* 1 year of general administrative assistant experience. (scheduling apointments, travel plans, emails, etc.)
* 1 year of fast food service experience
* 6 months as a street-level marketing and advertising assistant. (Internship. 
I would sit in on meetings with the client to see what their goal is, work with my boss to develop a strategy to achieve it *(basically see what events were going on in the area around a similar time and see where best to set up billboards and posters or distribute fliers and such, or even set up booths)* all while doing administrative assistant type stuff as well.
* 6 months of retail experience at my current job.
* General computer repair and assembly (I used to run a computer/phone repair buisness out of my dorm freshman year.)
* Developed understanding of Java and novice level Javascript.
* Proficiency in Word, Powerpoint, Excel, and Outlook.

I'm looking for a new job, because I need the money a full-time position would provide. Even if my currently hourly wage didn't increase. (My current manager will not let me work more than 25hrs/week even though we are understaffed most days and I'm trained in every department)"

I'm currently working as an IT intern for a tech company. I've been tasked with upgrading all computer users from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

My goal here is to deploy this update as smoothly and seamlessly as possible. I currently have a single USB 3.0 stick with Windows 10 installation media on it. I would prefer to simply upgrade the users rather than perform a clean installation, so that all their programs and files remain in the same place. These programs consist of an SVN shell, Autodesk products, Adobe products, and our own programs developed in-house. I have tested these programs on my own computer to ensure they will all work with Windows 10, and experienced no problems. Additionally, our Windows 7 license key seems to activate Windows 10 all the same, and this has been tested on 2 computers so far without any complications. Finally, this is a small office of less than 50 workers.

I would like to roll out this update in about 2 weeks, but I don't want to interrupt their work or hold up production. Some workers come in early and leave early, and some arrive late and leave late. Some work hours that are considered unusual. My question here is: how should I best roll out this upgrade while minimizing interruptions to the users?

Any help is appreciated.

My thoughts as of posting: Find the hours that users work and organize them into ""groups"". These groups would receive the update 5 at a time. I would manually install the update and ensure every program functions as it should. Our company has a network where we share files on a LAN, so I could hold the upgrade files in a shared folder so multiple users can be upgraded at the same time. I would make sure the Windows.old folder remains for at least 2 months just to be safe, in case users experience any problems in that time.

Again, any thoughts are welcome and I appreciate any assistance."

Here is my dilemma. I am a college graduate who has gone through many applications since graduating in 2012 with a degree in math. I thought I was going to teach, and got a teaching certificate but decided not to pursue it after going through student teaching and barely passing -- I am just not cut out for it. I also applied to various internships and jobs after graduating pertaining to math degrees-- got one interview as a price analyst. And that was it. I've been hopping contract positions as a tutor at various companies to support myself. I finally landed a consistent part-time job at a community college and I am a self employed tutor on the side. I make 22k a year with no benefits and I desperately want to change my situation but don't want to go back to school unless I am sure it will land me a better job.

 I enjoy the computing aspects of math more so than the proofs so I have not gone back to graduate school for math as I know no longer have an interest in that type of higher level math. I wish I'd known it sooner before reaching my junior year at college. I just stuck by the degree and finished it. Are there any jobs I can secure at this point with my self employed/part time work history? What would be the best job market to get into at this point? Any certification recommendations that could enhance my degree? At this point I consider my resume ""entry level"" as I have only mostly tutoring experience and that is not the field I want to be in forever as much as I like it(and there are no full time positions in this field). I would like to get a 9 to 5 job, would applying to an internship even be possible at this point? Any advice would be great. "

I have been working there for approx. 10 months (it's my first corporate experience and I have no prior similar experience). The internship is for a period of 1 year, so I've got 2 months left to go before my contract ends. Upon ending, it was stated in the original job listing that there exists the potential to receive additional employment opportunities, however that's all. This position is part-time, however one of the selling points is that I am given benefits and salary equal to that of a full-timer (clarification on salary: I receive the same amount per hour as a full-timer; I don't work part-time and receive a full-time amount).

Now for the offer: I received a job opportunity from Johnson Controls, also in finance. They haven't mentioned anything in terms of benefits or salary in the initial message, however they have asked me (and I quote): ""What would it take for you to move from your current role to a new one?"" They have of course asked for my number so that we could get in touch and talk.

I am interested in this job. There is no guarantee that IBM will offer me additional opportunities and I would like having something lined up once my current contract ends in 2 months. Plus, I just want more experience with various companies as I have one more year left of school and still have the ability to jump around for a bit longer.

So how should I respond to their question? I would like to know how Johnson's benefits/salary weigh against IBM's; are they better? (rhetorical question) 

Considering my current situation, I want to know if Johnson can offer me a better package. How can I ask them more information about this without appearing greedy or as though I don't care about the company beyond what they can offer me in terms of money? I do care about the potential for solid career progression, however in regards to short-term, more money/superior benefits is better for me at the moment.

Thanks for any insight anyone can provide."

I put a static variable inside a Worksheet_Calculate() event to track changes in the cell's contents upon any recalculations, and it seems to be working. However, I'm a bit worried and have the following questions:

1. Assuming I did not include any assignment statements (e.g. Sheet1.Range(...).Value = x), is there any way that my solution could cause unexpected alteration of the workbook? In general, are there ""dangerous"" types of code I should avoid, other than assignment statements (and infinite loops)? I'm used to coding in C, so feel free to go into detail here about weird corner cases.

2. Is there some kind of ""testing"" framework I could use after adding code to a workbook? The requesting person and I agreed that they would experiment with the altered workbook for a while before using it for real company data. But this kind of process (creating a backup copy of the original workbook and then manually testing the new one) seems inefficient.

In summary, I'm wondering how to avoid breaking things in a setting where there's no ""software deployment"" process. Should I just avoid using VBA if there's no one available to review the code?"

This is my first post here, allow me to introduce myself. I am 21 years old, with one year left to graduate from a private university with a major in Computer Science. My school's curriculum often leaves me unsatisfied. It's the same old Java class year after year with a few tweaks. So I often do some of my own learning outside of the classroom. I'm very passionate about learning new things, and my most prominent self-taught topic has been mobile application development, which has landed me 2 internships at the same company summer after summer as a mobile dev.

I've been dabbling in the topic of cyber security for a couple weeks now, and I'm quickly realizing that this is where I'd like to take my career. I love the idea of helping people by finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. I love problem solving and challenges. There's a certain level of critical thinking required with this that I don't get to see in typical software development. I've been reading a book called Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking by Georgia Weidman, and I love it. 

What I'd like to know is, where should I go from here? 
Do you have any other good book recommendations? Or maybe courses?
I am currently auditing some cyber security courses on Coursera, as my university does not offer any.
What is your opinion on all these certifications I've been running into on the Internet? I'm seeing many different CompTIA stuff and I've been looking at Cybrary.it 
Would certifications be worth it?

I am an Asian male in the class of 2018. I'm looking to study a major in either a field of Mathematics or Natural Sciences, and possibly a minor in Computer Science. I will be applying next year so I came here to look for reasonable choices I should pick. Here is my information:

Demographic: Asian Male

Residence: California

GPA: Unweighted 4.0, Weighted 4.57, UC GPA: 4.5

SAT: 1530 (730 English, 800 Math) Essay 8/7/8 (Took Sophomore Year)

SAT II: 800 Math 2, 780 Chemistry

AP Classes taken: AP Biology (Did not attempt exam), AP Language (4), AP Literature (will take senior year)

Dual Enrollment Classes: Introduction to Statistics, Calculus I, II, III, Childhood Psychology, Japanese I, Music History, Chemistry 1A, 1B, Communications 1A, Introduction to Computer Information Systems, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations (Will Take: Physics 4A/4B/4C, Introduction to Astronomy, Discrete Mathematics)

Degrees: I will earn two Associates' Degrees by the end of Fall 2017, one in Mathematics and one in Natural Sciences.

Military Leadership: I go to a school where a military aspect exists and is the focus. Consequently, test scores are much lower, as more time and resources are put into the military side. The school is divided into four 'companies', each with specific student staff running. I was the Training and Operations Officer in my Sophomore year, then was promoted to the Executive Officer position my Junior year.

Clubs: Due to my school being a military school, student-ran clubs were not a thing. However, I was able to convince the superintendent to allow clubs to be a thing, and I started up a research club, where members share interesting technological devices that they looked into, and described its specs, etc.

Extracurriculars: Kumon tutor, tutored at another less known tutoring place, Community College paid Math tutor/helper, summer internship, 200+ volunteer hours, private SAT tutor, Junior summer internship, school TA for AP Calculus AB/BC

My school is academically lax and has crazy grade inflation. I broke the record for the highest new SAT score of 1380, and that was from the graduating class this year. The second highest SAT score in my grade is 1240. Most students have a 4.0, but that is due to easy classes and no one really looks to go above and beyond.

I had an internship at a big company that, among other things, made certain hardware (can't go into much detail for anonymity reasons) which was supported for use with a massive amount of systems: Windows, Mac, Linux, DOS, Solaris, HP/UX, even VMS... you imagine it, they very likely supported it. For a lover of more exotic OSes and hardware, as I was (and still am), their testing center was heaven! Luckily I was allowed to spend a week there during my internship.

&amp;nbsp;

So there I was, at the second day of said week, happily working. I had been tasked with reconfiguring Sun machines in preparation for a new testing procedure. Having never worked with Solaris before this was a challenge, but with some help I got it mostly done - when lunch time came around, I had already finished 4 of the 5 needed machines and was mostly finished with the last one, just in time to hand it over to a senior engineer who was eager to launch the first test with them in the lab.


When I returned from lunch however, I was in for a shock: Marge was gone!

&amp;nbsp;

Marge was the name of the fifth and last [little SPARCstation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sun_SPARCstation_5.JPG/1024px-Sun_SPARCstation_5.JPG) I had to work on - all machines of a kind followed a certain naming convention: All running Windows were named after alcoholic beverages (yes, seriously. wonder why), all running Linux after flowers, all Macs after characters from the Sesame Street, etc. All Suns were named after characters from the Simpsons. Earlier I had finished work on Homer, Lisa, Barney and Apu... but where Marge had previously been all that remained were dangling cables and a startled CRT complaining ""NO INPUT"".

&amp;nbsp;

Great, so what do I do now? Can't just confess to my boss that I literally *lost* a machine, can I? Someone must've mistakenly thought it was not used anymore, I guessed, because I had powered it down for lunch break and this desk was usually unused. So I went around looking, asked people, but with no luck. Nobody had seen anything, thanks to lunch time. After an hour of frantic searching I decided to ask the nearest admin for help. Through a ping he was able to see that, weirdly enough, Marge was up and running! It took quite some time to convince him that I was not mixing up names and to get him to help me find out where Marge now was. As it turned out, according to the MAC address tables of the switches Marge had taken a trip across the whole site of the company's campus. Off we go! 


OK, off *I* go, disappointingly the admin wasn't too keen on the whole detective work thing. He did give me the number of the room the switch port from which Marge was online was patched to, though.

&amp;nbsp;

In the other building it only took me twenty minutes to find the room (should've given me a building map, too - totally nonsensical room numbering and confusing corridor layout don't mix) which happened to be an office next door to a storage room. In said office I surprisingly ran into another wide-eyed intern... and he had Marge sitting on a table, next to a pile of other PCs, laptops and some odd printers. As it turned out he was hired as an intern by the site's IT department and tasked with locating, collecting and testing unused equipment that was supposed to be in storage according to their inventory system. Apparently Marge had been incorrectly flagged as in storage. Fed up with convincing people I decided to power Marge down under protest of the other intern, grabbed it under my arm and marched off. I had a deadline to meet!


Luckily the other intern hadn't messed with the setup on Marge, so I could finish its configuration and deliver all 5 SPARCstations to the senior engineer in time.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Company pits interns in a fight, unknown to each other. Sun stolen and returned in the process."

I have a few questions regarding my options for the first semester of 2017/2018, and thought you guys might be able to help me! My situation is as follows. After starting my search in January and interviewing at M&amp;A departments at banks, boutiques, and Big4 advisory, I have been rejected around 10 times due to my age (I am currently a second years economics bachelor student; 20 years old). I have now realised that I am early to the game, which does not bother me, as my applications have resulted in a small network that I can use for an internship in two years time (finish my bachelor and do a semester abroad first).

I basically have an empty semester after this summer, and have a few options to fill it up. First off, I am also interviewing for private banking internships at large banks (The Netherlands). This is not my preferred area of choice, but I feel like it can set me up with a network to use into a finance position in the bank later, as well as give me valuable experience. If that does not work, my options are restricted to a minor. Which minor would you recommend for a career in finance? I was thinking a minor in either computer science or mathematics. CS because of its modelling advantages, and mathematics to show employers I have quantitative skills (maybe even do some quant finance courses in my master's). And, if I get a private banking internship, should I go for that or do one of the minors? Thanks in advance!"

I've done some searching around on here and haven't found anyone who was in my exact situation. I'm starting a 12-week data science bootcamp in a few weeks, where I will learn Python, R, and Hadoop and come out with several projects as a portfolio. I'm lucky enough to have the financial support of my parents right now, so I have a few months of headway after the conclusion of the bootcamp before I need to really start worrying. 

Some background:
I have a bachelors in chemical engineering (with a ~3.2 gpa from an average state school, if that matters at this point), and have a 3 month chemistry R&amp;D internship and a year of chemical process support (hands-on work with hardware both in the office and at customer sites, as well as data analysis and some meddling with Python to try and automate a process). The customers in question are semiconductor manufacturers, so I'm hoping some recruiter finds the fact that I've worked in overseas semiconductor manufacturing cleanrooms interesting enough to call me in (yeah, right). Anyway, my technical skills for this job would be data analysis with Excel and macro creation with Excel and VBA. Like I mentioned earlier, I dabbled in some Python while at this job - I spent some time actually learning the language to try and parse text documents and create charts that specify chemical delivery volumes based on specific events in the log. I really enjoyed trying to create something that worked well, but I really didn't have enough time because of how hectic the rest of the job was. 

So yeah, any advice? I'm on the east coast in case that matters as well

6gt9wn,71,2017-06-12,Do You Like It?,Bstabz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6gt9wn/do_you_like_it/,"I met Sam my sophomore year in high school (2009), she was a softball player and I was a baseball player. I was a sophomore on the varsity squad so I was the one who always had to go into the woods after practice and hunt down all the foul balls that were hit out of the field. Conveniently, softball practice had just ended, Sam and I were both in the woods hunting for balls, a baseball and softball were butted up against each other and we met in the same spot.  
	
I knew of Sam from seeing her around school but I was very awkward, she was beautiful and I never thought she would show any interest in me so I just never tried. Once we met in the woods I picked up both balls and handed her the softball. I nervously said “ahh, so you’re the ball hawk too, huh?” she laughed and said, “yeah, it was my turn this time”. I only had to pick up about 5 baseballs and she had at least 15 softballs cupped in her shirt so I replied, “Looks like you guys are having trouble keeping it fair.” She laughed and said, “you have no idea”. I awkwardly stood there for a second or two, not knowing what to say next so I did the typical thing and said “alright, well ill see you later”. She had a confused look on her face when she said “see ya”. I knew I had screwed my chances up and I beat myself up all the way home from practice. 
	
Once I got home I ate dinner, then sat down with my laptop to check my newly acquired Facebook profile that I created just days before, low and behold, I had a friend request from Samantha Davis. I quickly accepted and sat there for several minutes trying to think of a clever message to send her. I retyped the message at least 15 times, then proceeded to consult my older brother weather I should put a smiley face or not. The message ended up reading something like “Hey there! I figured you would still be in the woods collecting softballs, rather than sending me a friend’s request. Lol”. I closed my eyes and pressed send, within minutes she responded. We hit it off so well and about a week later we were “together”. It was even Facebook official, so we were about legit as you can get. 
	
Our relationship was amazing, we were inseparable in high school and by the time we graduated I was 100% positive that she was going to be my wife. I got along with her family great and she got along with mine, her and my mom hit it off especially well because my mom played softball in college. In January 2012, just one year after graduating, I proposed. It wasn’t the best timing because we were both struggling college students but hey, there is never a right time for anything in life. She said yes and we married in January 2013. 
	
Sam and I continued going to college full time and moved into a very small one bedroom apartment. Sam was an Art Major and I was a Chemical Engineering Major. It wasn’t my ideal career path, I wanted to be a strength and conditioning coach for a professional sports team, but I enjoyed the engineering curriculum. Artist don’t make a killing so I decided to make a slight sacrifice and go for a degree in which I could get a steady job making pretty good money upon graduating. 
	
Sam was an amazing artist, for extra money she would sell her painting. They were so realistic and beautiful. I can’t count how many days I would come home from my shitty job at the gas station and Sam would be in our room painting and singing, “All of me, loves, all of you” (our wedding song), as soon as I would walk into the room she would stop singing and say “Do you like it?”, I would always say “of course darlin” then give her a kiss. No matter our bad my day was, when she sang that song and I looked at her paintings I would immediately feel relief. 
	
A few years past and in 2015 we were finally in our last year of college. Everything was still amazing, I started and paid internship with a promised job to follow graduation and Sam was selling her paintings like hot cakes. We started planning our future and even had talks of having children once we are settled. Sam always said she never wanted kids but it seemed as if she was starting to change her mind. Until a few days past and Sam was extremely irritable and had not worked on a single painting, that was not like Sam. I just figure that mid-terms coming up were stressing her out or her period was coming. 
	
Neither of those ideas were the case, after a few weeks, Sam eventually started painting again, but instead of beautiful realistic people or flowers, everything was dark and gloomy. Dark forest, abstract shapes and other weird things. I came home one day and Sam had painted a canvas completely black, she asked ""Do you liked it?"", I thought she was messing with me and I jokingly replied “yeah, if your blind haha”. She began screaming at me that she worked for hours on that painting and called me an ass hole, I was so confused. I sat Sam down and recommended that she see a doctor, during our conversation she admitted that something was wrong with her and she doesn’t feel well, mentally. 
	
After a visit to the doctor they were able to determine that she had developed sever schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I remembered that Sam’s dad had these disorders when we were in high school but he killed himself soon after we graduated. I assured her that I would be right by her side through all of this and we would make it through this bump. The doctors prescribed her medication but Sam was very reluctant to take it because of its side effects. She stayed on the medication for about a week and was completely normal again, then she stopped taking it. Sam was always nauseas and complained of muscle spasms frequently. I thought that a few days off of the medication wouldn’t hurt, at least she wouldn’t be in pain. Right?
	
A few days later, I started to notice the odd things that Sam was doing again, the weird stuff that she was painting got increasingly disturbing. Sam was painting ghostly figures with no face, realistic faces with dark holes for its eyes and its mouth and just some really eerie shit. I would often catch Sam talking to herself in either gibberish or a different language. I started thinking about how her dad killed himself and I insisted that she take her medication, she refused several times. I had to get this under control so one night I grinded up one of her pills and made her a glass of wine, I spiked the wine with the medication so that it could at least get in her system. When I brought it to her she was sitting at her desk painting, I said “hey baby, got cha some wine”, initially she just said, “thanks babe” and continued painting. For some reason, when she turned around to grab the glass she looked at me and said, “I’m not falling for your BULL SHIT!”. The pill was completely dissolved and she didn’t not even look at the glass. She kept screaming “GET THAT SHIT AWAY FROM ME”. 
How did she know? At this point, I was terrified and I wanted to leave but I knew that I could not give up on my wife. I called my mom and told her what happened. My mom knew Sam almost more than I did, they talked regularly. Mom said to just let Sam sleep it off and she would come over in the morning.  
	
That same night I laid down for bed at about 9pm while Sam was still sitting at her desk painting. I told her good night and drifted off to sleep. At about midnight, Sam crawled in bed and woke me up, we talked for over an hour about her issues. We both cried as she said she only wanted to be better, I explained to her that for her to be better she had to take her medication. Sam got out of bed and walked into the kitchen, she came back with one of her pills, she explained that she would never get off of it again. Sam seemed so normal that night and just like the old Sam. Eventually at about 1:30am we bother drifted off to sleep. I fell asleep so happy knowing that Sam was going to be normal again. 

At one point in the night I suddenly woke up from a falling dream, I have no idea what time it was, I looked around and realized that I was awake then scooted over towards Sam to cuddle up and go back to sleep. I went to put my arm around her and it just fell to the bed, she wasn’t there. I opened my eyes more only to see a dark hooded figure standing beside my bed, the figure was pitch black with a white, the face did not have any features, just blank. My heart began to race and I started to feel an unbearable pressure in my chest, I was for sure that I was dying. The figure reached over me and put both of its thumbs over my eyes, it pressed down, I felt as if my eyes were going to shoot out of the back of my skull. I blacked out. 

When I woke up I was in a room that looked like a hospital room but with no machines and the bed I was lying in was very small and wooden. I just assumed it was a hospital because mom was sitting in a chair across the room, I immediately thought about Sam. I yelled “Mom where is Sam, is she ok? Is she in the hospital too?”. My mom only replied with “Um, Sam?”. I confusingly looked at her and said “uhh my wife? Ya know? Sam?”. My mom replied saying “Honey, you’ve never been married, you have been here at Cherry Hospital for a long time.” I said “Cherry Hospital? Am I sick? Where is Sam?” She huffed with tears up….Then said “Cherry Hospital is a mental institution, you’re here because in high school you murdered a girl in the woods beside the baseball/softball fields”. . She continued by saying that we go through this every few days when my medication wears off……If your reading this, its already too late, there is no use in trying to save me. I will be will Sam again soon...

I have been going out more often and trying to deal with it and it is improving for me.

I am in my first year of distance university, studying computer science and it is going well - but i cannot wait until i'm at a point in education to be granted an internship. The key issues i'm facing is that i have never been employed, and did not attend college, this would make it very difficult to prepare a CV and i cannot wait years down the line until i graduate. I do concede a lot of these issues are partly down to my own poor choices, but does anyone have any advice? I appreciate any replies massively - thanks in advance.

I'm not a military contractor or anything, but I am an intern at a DoD contracting firm, and also value my personal privacy (hey Verizon, what's up?).

I'm looking for something that covers most forms of malware (spyware, viruses, etc), and ideally is compatible with multiple computers (2).

Here's the catch though: I want a VPN as well... I haven't found an antivirus with a VPN incorporated.

When I look for a VPN I can't find one that meets my specifications: one yearly rate, unlimited access, and works for both iPhone AND PC on the same subscription.

It would be fantastic to find a suite that is both antivirus and VPN, but if not, I'd love to hear opinions on the best of each to meet those needs separately... 

I'm flexible on the antivirus but the VPN absolutely has to cover at least my phone and my pc, and bonus points if I can tack a couple more devices onto that for the same subscription.

Here are some options that I have thought of: 
1) live at tech and commute to alpharetta by marta (I think there is a marta train, and then I have to catch a bus, since marta train doesn't go straight into alpharetta). I don't think I'll drive since I don't want to go through that much traffic 

2) live at alpharetta and get an apartment (this one seems very unlikely since apartments are expensive, I have to pay water/electricity/internet separately), but obviously the commute is nicer, and I don't think apartments have half year leases--and I plan to go back to school on spring

Dear Mr.&lt;Person&gt;

As you already know, I am a Computer Science student at ____ College. I’m looking for part time work in the areas of programming and web development.I am now interested in applying my skills to something bigger. One of my fields of interest is Earth Sciences and its applications. Examples of this would be designing early warning systems for earthquakes or terrain modeling. These are the main reasons I am interested in an internship or part time work with your company. Although I have read the company website, I am still unclear on some significant details. I would like to know more about what your company does, what it's about, and how things happen. I would like to know more about what you are looking for. I don't know too much about GIS, but it looks very interesting. It looks like your company mainly deal with contracts, which I would like to know more about. 

You mentioned that people share duties in your company given the size. I have experience in this from volunteer work, though my previous server job was somewhat rigid. I consider myself a creative person who learns best by doing, and always look to learn new things. I’ve taken intro courses to Java, C++, C, Visual Basic, and web page design. I have experience with Visual Studios, command line environments, and several other platforms. I will be taking more courses, such as JavaScript or Python, in the Fall. I am currently the social media director for a club at &lt;school&gt; and use Microsoft Office extensively. I have a Github of code samples for you that I will provide a link to at the bottom of this email. If you didn’t already know, GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and web hosting service. This contains raw code samples (homework) and small projects.

I would be interested in setting up an informational interview with you as soon as possible. I can be reached by this email or by phone at &lt;number&gt;. 

My résumé is attached to this email and I look forward to hearing from you.

Recently I got a random email from Beyond (a resume service Ad). They said stuff/advice like:

1. No need for an objective because I have little experience.
2. My skills give off the ""doer"" not the ""achiever""
3. Lacking organization + consistency
4. Too short, too little information...said 217 words was basically incomplete.
5. Move education to the bottom...(still in college)
6. Usage of pronouns
7. Verb tense 

So I am here to decide which of these I should work on and which is basically a myth. I worked on my job descriptions to go from ""doer"" to ""achieve"" but in my time...I have not achieved much from my jobs. Most of my jobs are basically, go work, do your job, get paid, go home.

In a situation like that, what should I change? How should I change it? Currently, I am struggling with the transition from manual labor to professional work. How can I turn/spin something into an achievement if I never achieved anything, to begin with? This is proving to be harder than I first thought...

And yes, this is super general IT where I learned bits and pieces of everything (web design, SQL, networking, etc.). I primarily focused on my CCNA courses (intro to networking, R&amp;S, scaling networks, and connecting networks) throughout the program as well as cybersecurity. I am actually going to go to get my Masters in cybersecurity this fall. So far, I was blessed to work as an intern for one of the Fortune 500 companies last summer, working with their internal DNS team. Right now, for this summer's internship, I'm working with the same company with their internal network engineering team.

My first dilemma is that I'm stuck between cybersecurity and network engineering. Clearly, my internship experiences focus on network engineering but it's been hard for me to find and obtain any other work related experience with cybersecurity. If I do see a job posting of such, I noticed they're always asking for ""at least ___ year(s) experience with help desk"" or something along the lines of that. And the only ""real"" technical experience I have is with these internships.

My second dilemma are certs. Since I'm graduating (literally in two days, yay) with the bachelors degree, should I still be aiming to get certs? I have zero. If I should get into certs, which ones should I be looking into? I didn't know whether I should obtain at A+ or not considering my degree, but like I said, I don't know what I'm doing, career-wise. Was really really considering getting CCNA since I've been doing all these courses to help me prepare for it, but idk, I've always been nervous with tests and money's kinda hard to come by considering I have living expenses to pay for.

Third, I've already gotten a big feeling that my internship company is going to want to hire me for a permanent position. (I had the offers after my first internship but I was still finishing my last year for B.S.). The thing is, I just hate the commute and I'm not sure if network engineering is what I want to focus on if I'm going for my Masters in cybersecurity. Everyone is nice here but I feel left out and out of place, considering I'm very young compared to everyone else here. I have been constantly looking for related entry level jobs closer to me and there aren't many cybersecurity related ones. And if there are, they're mostly looking for experienced people. Since I'm getting my Masters in the city where I live, and where I commute is about an hour and a half commute on bus, should I accept their job offer and continue working while I pursue my Masters even if it's not in the same area (networking vs. cybersecurity)? Or should I just keep trying to find some help desk job around my area and work my way up?

I'll take any advice I can get please. I don't know who else to ask since my family immigrated from here, never got their high school diploma, etc. and I'm just not close enough to my professors to ask personally."

I graduated with an AAS degree in Computer Software Development in May 2015 and have been working full-time as a full-stack application developer in .NET and SQL since March 2015. I also have a 3 month internship as a Sharepoint/SSRS developer and 3 hackathons under my belt.

I started the job making $45,000 and am currently at $47,000. I have been applying to other jobs this year, hoping to make more money, but I'm not getting any traction. The positions I have applied to were entry-junior level, which I feel is slightly below where I'm actually at in terms of my data analyst skills and experience. My strongest skills are in vb/c# .net and SQL. For example, I completed an IKM assessment on SQL server and scored a 79 and am in the 61st percentile.

I'm a little dismayed that I've been rejected for entry level positions, and honestly I'm rethinking a career in IT if I can't even get an entry job. Anyway, how can I make myself more marketable besides certs? Am I limiting myself by specifically looking for jobs with mostly SQL work?

He has not said anything about hiring a second person. Instead, I figured out from an email sent from the college. Deliberate or not, I have no idea what he's up to, he's never in the office so I can never know what he is doing.

First, thanks to anybody who takes the time to read and reply, I'm sure you all have lots of other things you could be doing with your time so I really appreciate any response, big or small. I apologize in advance because this is a bit lengthy! 

So, I'm currently feeling pretty stuck, I discovered my passion for programming about 8 months ago, and I was coding like crazy for a while, 16 hours a day, determined to work at Google within 2 years, ready to take on the world! I learned a LOT and picked up on quite a few different things, I like to think I'm pretty good with Python, and I have worked a bit with JS, Bash, Java, Php, Django, Flask, Bootstrap, etc etc. I've found that it really doesn't matter what language or framework you work with, the logic is all the same, and learning a new language is really just a syntactical thing. I've also had the opportunity to attend a Programming competition in Nebraska, where I got the opportunity to meet my first Googler and proceed to bug him with so many questions to that he probably hates me! (Sorry Gus, although you did accept the offer to ride to the banquet center with our crew after your talk, and it's not my fault we were staying in the same hotel!) 

I've spent a LOT of time trying to expand my knowledge base in the tech world. I follow all the news articles, I watch the talks from PyCon and others (Raymond Hettinger has become a personal hero, although I would be terrified to meet him, I feel like I would try to act like I knew stuff and make a total fool of myself) I remember getting all excited and telling my friends (pretty much against their will) how awesome D-Waves breakthroughs on quantum computing were, or when I discovered Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning. I got so excited hearing about the new TPU that was released, trying to figure out how I could get my hands on one. But, lately I've been feeling really stuck. 

I know I could take on almost any job placed in front of me, not because I'm anything special, but because I absolutely love what I'm doing. I've yet to find many things out of reach, I figured out how to connect IoT devices to the cloud with XBee chips within 48 hours of getting a chip, devoured the first Arduino book I got, and tweaked some old code to turn my Arduino into a tiny itty bitty gaming console using the (outdated) NTSC module. (It really wasn't anything fancy) and my coolest project was a Flask website, that allowed users to login, then link the website to a Twitter API console, and mine tweets based on location or keyword, then train and classify datasets using a multinomial naive bates classifier! (Which sadly isn't live because I can't come close to affording the cost of the server time necessary, since it is set up to collect tweets in real-time, each user would have to have a persistent connection, and it would easily overload any cloud computations I could afford! Not to mention how computationally costly it is to build classification models) 

I know I'm headed in the right direction, studying computer science, attending events, spending lots of free time programming, but I've been struggling with a couple of obstacles that have cropped up.
One of which is that I am currently located in the Midwest and I am basically surrounded by a bunch of country-folk, a lot of the people I know are quite literally scared of tech, people out where I live think that ""networking"" means turning the wifi box off and on, and the cloud is some scary thing that will never actually get used, and although there are some tech jobs near urban areas about an hour or so from where I live, most of those jobs are looking for Senior developers, of which I am not. I've searched far and wide for jobs where I could do what I love, I would do it for free, literally, I would pay money to work for a company like Google, (Yes, I admit I have a slight obsession with Google, but the reason I got interested in tech was by reading a book called The Innovators and the chapter that inspired me most of all, was the one regarding how Sergey and Larry built the first spider, not to mention that Google is miles ahead of everyone else in AI research which is what I want to focus on eventually and hope to get a PhD in!) 

Another obstacle I've been attempting to overcome is that I completely switched my life around, I was a marketing major, in high-school I started a lawn-care company and did really well with it, ended up making more than some of my teachers (and proceeded to blow it all because teenager me saw shiny cars and cool clothes) I was in DECA and became a state officer and a state champion at competition. I thought marketing was my niche, so I had been pursuing that for a long time, I did jobs in retail, cut my teeth knocking doors for a while, and eventually founded another company that traveled the country selling medical devices (really long story, the company shut down within 6 months and I learned a very valuable lesson about trusting employees, I was getting robbed blind, gambling addictions are very real, and very dangerous!) In the months after having my trust in people completely destroyed, and going through a minor bout of stress-related depression (I was a full time college student while running that company, I quite literally about killed myself, I was working 100+ hours a week, leaving to head to trade-shows all over the country on Thursday morning, driving as far as 10 hours away, working all weekend, then driving home Sunday night, and heading directly to my classes. Going to school from 9AM-7PM I was able to fit a full course-load in just 3 days) But during my bout of depression, I found a light in programming/math. I had tricked myself into thinking I loved business, but my Dad is an engineer, as is my Grandpa, and I guess I was just being a rebellious teen, because I quickly realized software is my true calling. 

Only problem is.. I had only needed Algebra for a marketing degree, I switched my major, and now I'm 2 years into college, but just now starting Calc 1 and although I fell in love with math, I'm feeling really behind! A lot of my friends are getting internships, heading off to real schools and leaving my dingy community college in the dust, and some of them are even getting real jobs! I'm literally willing to live in a cardboard box and eat dirt for the opportunity to work on real software (No joke, I will work for free, just let me code, let me build something that matters, I'm sick of all these pet projects that are just for my own enjoyment *Python is preferred, Anything involving AI and I would cook, clean, and do pretty much anything to have the chance to work on it*), and I'm watching all these people who don't even really seem to care about it get these awesome job offers just because they decided they liked technology a couple years back! 

My absolute dream job would be to work at Google, but that's a bit of a pipe dream as that's what everybody wants, and out where I live, I've never met a single person who has/is working for Google. I'm currently working as a security guard because the only tech related jobs near me that I am qualified for are basically involve production line Wordpress dev, which would be torture because that's not even real development. I can work with SQL, Bootstrap, Flask, Html, CSS, Django, and Jinja2 so I know I could do Wordpress, but I hate web-design, I really want to work with algorithms, and math! (I know, I know, beggars can't be choosers!) 

What would you recommend? How can I get people to pay attention to me, even though I'm new to the industry? Is the big 4 an attainable goal? How could I get a part-time job doing software while in college? 

TLDR: I'm new to tech, switched my major from business, currently behind in math and also don't have much real-world experience in industry, but I've been working really hard to catch up, and am willing to sacrifice anything to do what I love (programming). I'm hoping for advice, encouragement, or any knowledge you wish you had known when you started your career! 

Edit: Because words are hard. "

So I graduated last year obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Biology in Switzerland. I spent the following time period until now studying in my free time and looking for internships or jobs as I was refused a grant. I tried again this year applying to several grants with no more success. My applications have been all turned down due to a lack of experience, insufficient formation or a combination of both (My CV having been reviewed on multiple occasions I doubt it is the cause).

I'm now considering that a Master's degree may not be something I pursue for a very long time. I've asked my job counsellor and every local source for advice as to where I can look for a job with no success: they are clueless and I've been told on multiple occasions that I am screwed and should give up on getting a job in my field.

So I turn to reddit for help: I need ideas as to where I can look for jobs, internships or other oppurtinities. 

Here's a few things about my degree and current experience:

* I have roughly 12 months of experience as a research assistant spread over a time period of two years in labs working in the fields of cellular biology, molecular biology and microbiology.
* I study programing (Python and R) as well as statistics in my free time, and excelled at these during my time at university.
* My bachelor had no specialisation or project/paper. I did however select modules aimed towards microbiology, environmental science and cellular pathogenesis. 
* I also followed classes on communication skills and project management/team management this year.
* I'm fully billingual in English/French.
* I cannot rely on my family (we're estranged and I have no desire to contact them).
* My end goal is to be a teacher or a similar position at the academic level; I love teaching but really do not stand teens/kids or high school/college.

That's about it. If you have any tips, feel free to comment or DM me. Any help is appreciated!

The technologies we use consist of all 'big data' stacks including Hadoop, spark, oozie, Hive, with all of the languages including Scala, Pig, and a little Java.

I've never coded in Java or Scala, and have spent the last week going through tutorials and documentation about how all of these techs work and how to use them. I feel pretty overwhelmed given I've never used any of these technologies and feel as though I've been contributing nothing.

Today my boss offered me the choice to work on a new project that I would have to architect myself and build end to end. It seems pretty daunting, and to be honest seems like a high priority project for an intern. On the plus side, I have the whole summer to build it, and the members on my team said they would help guide me and give me code reviews. On the negative side, I fear that the worst case situation might occur- I don't finish building it- and basically complete no work for the summer.

The other option is to work on a time sensitive issue with my boss. He would give me (hopefully) smaller tasks to complete and give me a new one each time. The plus side of this is that it isn't as daunting as creating an entirely new system from the ground up. On the negative side, I fear that he will see how new I am to all of this technology, and become frustrated that I am unable to deliver what he asks in the time frame that he expects it. This is compounded because the issue he is working on is time sensitive.

Basically, my options are: 
1) Try and learn all of the technologies to build a system that at least works by the end of the summer without exposing my lack of knowledge early on.

2) Work on a less comprehensive system overall, but potentially expose to my boss how little I know and risk frustration and disappointment.



I'm looking for any advice anyone may have, especially those who are DS and have interns. If you have any advice whatsoever, I would love to hear it. If anyone can recommend some good tutorials they particularly enjoyed, I would also welcome that.

My plan of attack right now has been studying how all of the big data stacks work, and honing my Scala and Java skills after work, but now that I am faced with a decision I might have to alter my plan of attack depending on which option I choose.

Background: Just graduated with a Physics degree, originally intended to go into grad school and do research in cosmology. I did a lot of undergrad research, which is where I got most of my experience in programming. That work gave me a decent amount of experience in Python (2.7, mostly using libraries made for research like numpy, matplotlib, and astropy), and a little bit of C (I've got ~a year of C/C++ from numerical methods/computational physics classes), but I have no other background in software. I'm in my late 20s.

Questions:

1) Since I don't have a huge background in software, will supplemental paid coursework be useful? I'm using MIT OCW and a couple of Udemy courses (obtained on sale) to brush up on programming/CS basics (e.g. data structures/algorithms, neither of which were taught in any detail during the physics degree). I looked at a handful of coding bootcamps, but I'm skeptical of those programs given the cost. There's a decent community college in my area that offers a large variety of CS courses, which are relatively cheap for residents. Would it be worth taking any courses there?

2) For a software portfolio (which I'll be putting up on GitHub), how sophisticated are projects supposed to be? During my undergrad research, I wrote a couple dozen Python programs, mostly made to do basic data analysis or create plots for a publication that resulted from one of the projects. All of them are relatively simple programs (the most complicated one performs a nonlinear, blackbody fit to data, and some additional scaling after that), so I'm not sure if they're worthy of inclusion.

3) Internships, for the most part, only take currently enrolled students on track to earn a CS degree. Other people have asked this question, and those threads usually have someone saying ""*most* employers only take current students, but there's a handful that will take recent graduates"". Is there a list or other reference for those programs? It being June now it's rather too late for a Summer internship now, but I'd like to know if there are any that I should be looking out for later on.

Thanks in advance for any guidance."

VSTS is what they said they use for source control, and never mentioned Git. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be using Visual Studio for everything, I also work on a Mac.

I made sure to look up all these technologies before the interview and have a very basic idea what they do, I just don't know how everything works together. They said I would be on a small team and be doing small tasks at first.
I'm already going on Udemy and looking for good courses to go about teaching myself as much as I can.

Financially, I am no longer able to work a 40 hour week unpaid (only travel expenses are covered) plus my motivation for this job has died.

I'd number these events-

But there are so many I don't bother recording,

Due to the fact that they seem too minuscule to warrant a document.

I feel a close connection to these songs,

As though they were the backdrop to my initial plans.

Motivating me through my triumphs-

As well as picking me back up during the moments I wanted to just end it.

They were the anthems to my dreams of success,

Outlining the path I needed to take towards victory.

I absorbed each and every song,

Every remix, every performance,

Never missing a single release.

Today, there's a new release-

Although,

It's not ""new"" at all.

It would have come out when I was 8-

I Google'd it.

It released during another event,

How?

How did I miss it?

I have every one-

I thought there was a discrepancy on my phone,

But-

It just appeared there today-

Even the WayBackMachine archive shows it-

I can't even begin to remember all the times I indulged in the lyrics,

Replaying every song in my mind, devouring the meanings,

How did I miss it?

When I read through now-

It's eerily invasive.

Incredibly relevant to my current event.

As though,

My mind has been broken-

And my thoughts scattered, spread out into the universe-

Surrendered to the Collective Unconscious-

And poured back into these lyrics-

It's like a violation, but-

An Omen.

One of the lyrics, outlines verbatim what I wrote even just hours ago.

I haven't listened to the song yet,

But-

I'm almost fearing a sense of familiarity.

As if, although hearing it for the first time ""here""-

It'll trigger some sort of past event that has been lost prior,

Just forcing me deeper into this void of confusion and fear.

If you're reading this-

Whoever you may be-

Are you aware of the concept of the Singularity?

That, with the rise of innovation-

It reaches a point, a curve growing exponentially-

Until it just-

Hits a 90-degree rise-

Progress.

I feel as though, in a strange way, these events are rising to a peak.

All these strange occurrences, changes, that only I am aware of-

Are leading to a point that I need to prepare for.

I feel an intense fear, as though I'm having to brace myself-

But,

I forget why.

It's like,

The urgency and rapid succession of time-

Makes me feel ever increasingly unprepared for what's to come-

These songs, they're unlike past and future albums-

Completely devoid of hope.

It's like it's not even the same band I'm accustomed to,

Their voices and overall sound presence is recognizable, yes-

But their messages are bleak,

Imminent failure.

I'm almost certain this wasn't here yesterday.

When I think back, there's only one truly defining action I made-

I acted out, echoed into the web my growing apathy-

And I was answered.

When I read her thesis, when I spoke to her,

I felt a sense of familiarity, understanding,

I didn't skip a beat during conversation-

It was like I wasn't even myself,

That is-

The accumulation of memories from this existence that made me this way-

Ceased, and I was suddenly my ""best"" self.

No,

My ""true"" self.

I need to pressure how important the discovery of her thesis is to me-

Before my admittance to the ward, I scoured the internet for evidence-

Some sort of proof of concept-

And I found nothing.

Now?

It was the key to her success years ago.

How did I not find her?

And-

What were the chances that of all situations,

She was actually the one to find me?

DAY TWO

I feel as though in this moment, I've witnessed the true power of entropy.

In my outburst of protecting what passion I hold for my dream of innovation,

Rather than the backlash I braced myself to endure,

I feel as though I passed a test that granted me entry into my home.

Through my juvenile impulse to fight the rejection I've faced-

As ungraceful and spontaneous as it may have been-

I have the opportunity to witness what exists beyond the curtain.

I feel as though I'm an imposter, lacking the true credentials to belong-

But, at the same time-

This is where I need to be right now.

If I wasn't so violently against the concept that fate guides our destiny-

I would embrace this as a form of true justice.

DAY THREE

She told me,

That despite my odds I have exhibited resilience and persistence,

That I am strong and determined.

Why can't I believe it?

DAY FOUR

I feel as though the vice grip that I've been trapped within,

Twisting into me the sense of urgency in which I have to act,

Has ceased its constant pressure over my mind.

It's almost as though,

I was playing catch-up,

And I finally achieved the equivalent of where I was before.

I don't know why I said that,

That doesn't make any sense.

DAY FIVE

It happened again, I had another episode.

Another mismatch.

False memory.

This time, it wasn't just on behalf of the other person-

All evidence of the prior event were erased.

No proof that what I was trying to explain was even real.

The funniest part, was that it came about the same way.

He started telling me about the boss battle again, word for word,

I began to remember this, and I challenged it by spoiling the ending.

This might be rude, but honestly I'm tired of feigning ignorance.

But,

The time was off, last time he didn't tell me until after the expansion.

And I wasn't even ""here"".

So, instead, I just got a reply of confusion and amusement-

He's used to me doing this, so it wasn't a shock.

Still,

He let out a jovial cheer at the murder of the boss,

Only to react in shock when she rose from the dead with full health-

A constant stream of bitching through the cutscene,

Turn to excitement towards the enhanced gameplay mechanics,

Ending with a request I've heard a million times to install the game myself.

Today...

He cheered, the boss died, and that was that.

Because the expansion isn't released ""here"" yet.

So that feature hasn't been implemented.

And I sound completely, utterly, insane.

What am I even talking about?

""Here""?

Where was I before?

This doesn't make any sense, the first half of the reaction was verbatim-

It was as though a record skipped, and resumed on a different song.

Not even a song, no-

Like an entirely different album altogether.

I don't even understand what I'm trying to say,

I don't know what ""here"" means, what I'm trying to imply.

It's like I'm incapable of remembering what the meaning is behind what I say,

Just moments after I say it.

Almost as though I'm reacting out of impulse-

When there isn't anything to react to to begin with.

Sometimes, I'll recall something, blurt it out-

And when asked what I meant, I don't even know.

It's like it was someone else,

I'm still me-

But I have no reason to know, or understand, what I just said.

I scoured Google for the cutscene, and the questline,

Nothing.

Here's the problem, though-

It's not just a memory that hasn't happened yet,

Now-

It will never happen.

Because it only would happen if that was the first time he fought her.

Before, he didn't get into the game until later.

But now?

It's too late.

That entire situation, will never repeat.

It isn't possible.

So why do I recall something that can never, and will never, happen?

I'm fearing the weight of the consquence behind that.

Many of these, I hold onto as beacons of hope-

Possibilities that I have yet to look forward to, a future-

More often than not, they're proved to be warped.

Ever so slightly different, so that the variables aren't the same,

Leading to an entirely different outcome,

Alien to what I know.

I see no purpose to this other than to torture me.

I feel like I'm beginning to doubt what I used to believe were facts-

I can't describe the fear behind this confusion,

It's like I'm painfully aware of the loss of my sanity.

If I think I'm insane, I'm not right?

It's when you whole-heartedly believe it, that's when you're crazy?

I feel like I have one foot on the platform,

And I'm too scared to take the train-

As I don't know where it would lead me this time.

What does that mean, though?

""This time"".

That would imply that I knew where I was going before,

Which I didn't.

I don't.

Only sometimes, in strange and unfamiliar fragments of recollection.

I wasn't always like this, I remember when it began.

I could have sworn I had died.

I went to the ER, and spent a month in the psych ward.

When I got out, it was like I was released to a world I didn't recognize.

My relationships were broken,

People I considered friends barely knew my name,

And new faces were so familiar with me that it felt like a violation.

I spent four years in isolation, existing within a garage to avoid it all.

I don't want to explain my theory, because I don't want to solidify the idea.

If anything, the only reason to share is to be proved wrong.

Quantum Suicide.

I died.

But my consciousness carried on elsewhere.

I don't want to accept that.

Because there's no way I could remember even if that were the case.

So instead, I surrender myself to my official diagnosis-

Which isn't even really accurate, but a placeholder.

My doctor says I'm too coherent and motivated to have schizophrenia-

So, they settle for psychosis.

But, unlike psychosis which usually lasts a limited time before escape-

I am in a constant, unending, cycle of pain and confusion.

Sometimes I wish I were insane.

If this is all in my head, that means that I'm the only person suffering.

I can deal with that.

But,

If this is actually happening,

It means that all the memories I have of all the people I've met,

And all the places I've been, but never visited,

Are confined within my existence, and mine alone.

They won't remember me,

Even if they did,

They probably aren't the same as I would remember.

I feel like a hypocrite by admitting this-

As there's nothing that I despise more than choosing to be ignorant-

But I wish I could just forget everything.

DAY SIX

There's one constant to these false memories-

It's painful to admit,

I was happier.

I had purpose.

Whether I was in University,

Or bearing a child,

It's better than it is here.

Yet, they all share the same end-

I'm almost certain-

No, positive-

I ended my own life to get here.

Almost like I got past a point that I needed to prevent.

As though something terrible happened,

And I'm to blame,

And I needed to cut out any chance of it happening again.

I created this Hell for myself.

To protect them.

I don't even know why I'm typing that,

I don't know who ""they"" are.

Just that-

As long as I never do, I've succeeded.

I feel like I'm beating against a wall,

Trying to break an opening-

But,

It was something I built up myself.

If I seek to accomplish what my true intentions here are,

I will unravel everything that's been put in place to stop me.

Essentially,

I'm only fighting my own efforts.

DAY SEVEN

As far as the depths of my own experience, I feel a memory hold two parts:

The facts behind the event that took place,

And the emotion involved with it.

I feel as though despite forgetting the events that have taken place-

The fear, rage, desperation, urgency, and helplessness that accompanied it-

Remains a constant.

It's a perpetual dread that follows me, knowing that at any moment-

It could all repeat.

But I don't know the signs to stop it.

Or what the situation would even entail.

Despite rejecting the notion that I'm completely delusional-

The aspect of myself that I conceal and protect most vigilantly-

Is that I hope that I am.

If I could just dismiss this as insanity, I would be free.

But-

The slim chance that I hold an ounce of truth in the matter-

Means that I'm forever a hostage to the responsibility of the consequences.

I'm trying to hide from him the fact that I'm beginning to spiral,

That I feel even he is part of the gaslighting,

An attempt to demoralize my efforts,

To sway my actions,

That who I deem to be my closest allies are conspiring to stop me.

I've had this happen before, they tell me it's because they care-

That I come across as though I'm torturing myself-

And I should just give up whatever nonsensical mission I've given myself.

This is why I cut them out, I shed myself of the masquerade I was living.

It's not enough, I need complete solitude.

The only way I can achieve clarity of the truth,

Is by firmly accepting what I know-

And rejecting their efforts to ""save"" me.

If I could just have the peace to reflect on what I remember-

I can develop a plan, and attempt to at least try to find a solution.

Everything else is just a distraction,

I need to escape this.

I wish I could die, but that would be selfish-

If there's one thing I could take away from the past,

Is that ultimately, in the end, nobody will care about this more than myself.

How could they?

They don't know.

If I don't live my life in accordance to what I believe my assignment is,

It will be a waste, and I wouldn't feel worthy of life.

How does he do it?

Live without purpose, without motivation-

Absolutely no sign of any aspiration other than to perpetuate his own despair.

The more I reach in to attempt a rescue-

The more I feel tainted and poisoned by his apathy.

This will come across completely void of any empathy-

But-

I can't continue here.

I will not allow myself to be dragged into a pit of unending grief.

If there isn't any effort put in place to find hope-

I will abandon.

This makes me feel as though I'm the worst type of person.

But for the sake of self-preservation and survival,

It's completely necessary.

DAY EIGHT

From my recollection,

During the summer of 2010 - Fermilab tested their Holometer.

And it was a success.

This inspired me, and it wasn't just a niche event-

The results were shared across the world news,

Everyone was aware of what had taken place-

And the weight behind what they had discovered.

However, my recollection is wrong.

Fermilab didn't even complete the construction of the Holometer until 2016.

And didn't test it until September of last year.

The results?

Complete failure.

The fact that the experiment event took place wasn't newsworthy,

And most people aren't even aware of its existence.

I don't know what to make of this yet.

Either they're lying about the results, and it's true-

Or it doesn't work.

And I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with myself.

Because without the capability to split,

I will never escape.

Although I state that with such certainty,

I don't even know what ""escaping"" entails.

Hollow thoughts, without meaning.

Just being echoed through my mind.

With no real purpose.

Other than to torture me.

Sometimes I feel as though I think in another language,

I say things that don't even make sense to myself.

And I don't even know why.

It's compulsive.

Like I used to remember why I said these things-

But in a different life, under different circumstances.

And now they're just a ghost of what used to be my truth.

DAY NINE

D-Wave Quantum Computer
Fermilab Holometer
SpaceTime Insight
CERN LHC

Using their technologies, essentially created a system that could simulate the results of every consequence - this was used to predict and prevent natural disasters worldwide. Areas that were going to be affected could essentially be pre-emptively evacuated to reduce peak casualties.

This breakthrough was then bastardized for commercial use - countries were given a choice to either pay a tax to be protected and warned, or if left unfunded, would be victim to disasters without warning.

Then, they discovered with a more precise Holometer 2.0 that when the disasters were prevented - they still occurred in a separate reality. This lead to the development of what became a ""dead zone"" - a reality dedicated to simply hosting all disasters and horrific events. Countries and even individuals who either defied or were unable to pay for protection were cast into this hellscape, with no way of escape. It became a death sentence - the worst possible existence.

There was a resistance group of scientists determined to destroy this, but were sabotaged from within - a fellow member sold them out for their own safety, and they were scattered to different points in existence to prevent the possibility of them remembering and coming together to prevent its development.

321 Fremont Boulevard, Fremont California - Something Happens Here.

""The Emerald Woman"" - I gave this nickname to an informant?

I met her for the first time the year after I finished at the University,

My professors had invited me to an afterparty,

We were celebrating the public release of one of our latest discoveries,

She was dressed so flamboyantly, she looked terribly out of place,

Bright, emerald, sparkling green,

I was tipsy, and called her ""The Emerald Woman"",

She laughed, almost forcibly, and told me she liked that,

I would end up working for her in the coming years.

I remember being an intern,

We were going to gather in the lab,

Nobody knew about the plan but us few involved,

When we got there, they were waiting for us,

She was heading the investigation against us,

I remember the moment she betrayed our cause,

And the disappointment,

Because there was no other person I looked up to as much as her,

And she condemned us to a fate worse than death.

I'm staring at a tile floor,

I'm looking at my knees,

My hands are above my head,

She's explaining herself, but I'm not listening,

I'm too devastated,

Why did it have to be her,

I can hear the blood rushing in my ears,

I'm afraid, not of death,

I'm afraid because I know where I'm going to go,

And that there's nothing I can do from there.

The door outside the lab is open, the lights outside are dim,

Over the PA - the radio is playing an oldies station,

They're playing ""The Air That I Breathe"" by The Hollies,

The computer is in the final stages of calculation,

They're determining where they're going to scatter us all,

She tells me how sorry she is, how much pain she's in,

I won't even look at her, I remain silent,

She tells me she's using what little influence she has to make this easier,

That she won't place me somewhere where I'll suffer completely,

She's reassuring me that I won't even remember,

So it will be okay,

My throat is dry, I'm ceasing my breath so I don't cough,

I'm repeating in my mind what lead me here,

Desperately holding onto the facts,

Trying to burn images of schematics into my mind,

I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,

She's wrong,

I'm not going to forget.

Before all this, before it became a tool of destruction and corrupting power,

We put the finishing touches on it.

If there's one thing that would at least stall the development,

It would be our individual failures.

Assassinate our potential, so we don't reach a point to deploy it.

What little influence I held over the outcome of the next jump,

It would be one which I had as little power as possible.

The least amount of resources or credibility to rise to that level of success,

So at least I wouldn't have to live with the guilt of ending the world.

It was an incredibly selfish and foolish move,

Essentially surrendering the power to stop it from the inside,

By erasing all connection to the events entirely.

Preventing the ability to create it, just opened it up for someone else-

Now there is no possible path to get close to where the action is.

I shed myself of the responsibility, and was promised to forget the details-

Now I get to live in the hell that I deserve for giving up on fixing my mess.

Now I get to witness it repeat, with all prior knowledge, and no hope to stop it.

Before, I was simply condemned to an alternate existence of peace-

Now?

I will surely die in the dead zone.

Alongside millions of others.

Out of my own neglect and stupidity.

The Emerald Woman did me a favor placing me here,

And I squandered it with self-sabotage in the process.

Her betrayal was less of a backstabbing,

And more of an alternative opportunity to prevent it-

She was feigning deception to give us another chance,

And I was too blinded by my rage to see her true intentions.

People can die, but our ideas live on,

Why did I ever assume that I was the key to its success,

How narcissistic did I have to be to assume nobody else would figure it out,

I violently deny any evidence or proof of fate being our guide,

But if there's one thing that I've learned about myself,

Is that either by trying, or by ignorantly rejecting to act,

I do nothing for this world but aid in its destruction.

I feel as though I've come to this conclusion before, many times-

And each ends with another attempt to reach death-

Each death just resulting in another awakening somewhere else-

The details ever so slightly different, but the situation just as dire-

Essentially, I'm in a cycle of committing Quantum Suicide.

In hopes that I will run out of potential lives, and cease to exist.

Because the pain of the helplessness I've created for myself is too much.

And I would rather waste away in a void for eternity than watch it unfold,

I'm breaking the cycle tonight.

Death will only result in suffering for those around me,

And finding myself alive on another path.

The futility is tearing me apart, but I'm embracing the suffering.

I truly deserve to feel this pain.

I await my punishment when I watch their future successes,

And eventually lose everyone I care about to their dictatorship.

I'm basking in the Hell that I've designed myself to live in.

Death is a luxury, and one that I have no hope of achieving.

Even being cast into a reality of isolation, void of any other being-

Would be more merciful than this.

At least then, I won't have to watch all the people I love die.

And know that I essentially killed them.

I see everyone that I cut out, the friends that I've abandoned,

I understand now why I do this.

I'm a coward.

And a murderer.

I see why I instigate fights, try to scare him away, make him leave me-

I truly feel that someone such as myself is undeserving of love.

All of these self-sabotaging behaviors, I see the purpose behind them.

I was simply hiding the trauma, forcing down the truth,

I'm such a hypocrite.

Would it be inhumane to attempt to warn of these events-

Or would it solidify the idea in their minds that it's truly possible?

I know I'll be painted to be mad, but I am already-

If I speak up, will I just be the catalyst to the apocalypse?

Or will my silence just allow them to rise without retaliation?

Either way,

No hope.

Too much info, not enough info, etc. This time I am just gonna get the question out with some info and be done with it.

I have been working in IT or almost 3 years. Half of this has been as an intern. I've worked for only one company so far. This is a MSP located in South Louisiana that has expanded to a few locations in Texas. The experience I am gaining is incomparable to some places. Or that is what I gather from those who work for a single entity around here.

My role with the company is a Help Desk Tier 1. In fact, I am the only tier 1 guy here since March after a guy was fired for not following directions. But my role does not stop there. I also do on site service and installs, I do Tier 2 work due to Tier 2 being made up of 2 people who have other roles that makes it hard to solely focus on support (25% of the time I escalate a ticket it comes back to me), I do server project grunt work (discovery of shares and permissions), and I help with Network Projects (mostly phyical installs but the occasional Access Point and Switch configuration). This company has plenty of room to move up, if we could find more support guys to replace me.

The problem: I work for a man who is in love with Grant Cardone, believes that we should work until our eyes bleed and our family forgets who we are, no compensation for time or effort, constantly belittling people on my team, implemented a ""bonus program"" that took 5% from everyone's pay but paid out 3.75% every quarter if we, as a team, made certain goals that required several hours overtime (once we agreed to it we could not back out cause that ""was not in writing.""), and does not believe in raises unless you put in your own time to get Certs that he has deemed worthy (mostly Cisco Networking and Windows Server).

For a while I was considered the ""favorite"" by the Operation Manager because I followed the process to the T. As in, would announce to the small team that I was the favorite and she would go out of her way to make sure I was taken care of. This caused a group to be made that would gang up on me and nominate me to do really tedious work no one else would want to do. Even though that Operation Manager is no longer here the remaining group still gangs up on me.

Yesterday I went on an interview for a Help Desk Tier 1 job at a bank. It seems likely I will get a call back. The guy told me that it is possible to move up from help desk BUT since they have everyone they need in the other roles its not likely. They compensate for overtime but try to discourage when they can. There are yearly raises, up to 10%. Yearly bonus based on personal KPIs. Knowing people who work here, the workload is low. My plan, if I were to take this job, would be to take the slow pace and study for CompTIA and Cisco certs. Make myself more desirable, then move on to another MSP or a project role. My end game is to become a Project Manager.

Everyone I speak to tells me that I should not continue to work where I am at. That what I am going through is not normal in IT and I am being treated unfairly. But I feel like these people only hear the ""bad"" I say and not the good.

Now, with all that being said, does it seem like I am just being a baby with wanting to leave? Does this other job seem worth it with my plan? I am just concerned I am trading gold for fool's gold. I am willing to elaborate on any details and answer any questions. Thank you!"

6h1v0b,5,2017-06-13,I hate being a latebloomer,sadfasdf214,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6h1v0b/i_hate_being_a_latebloomer/,"There are certain milestones everyone hits when they hit certain ages. In high school people start dating as well as losing their virginities. 

At 18 everyone is in college and they start experiment, having sex with random guys and girls as well as spending a month of summer vacation with their new college friends going on awesome and exciting trips. Also Spring Break is a great opportunity to get acquainted (have sex) with guys and girls from other schools at Cancun. 

By the time everyone is 19 or 20 they get an idea of what they want to do for the rest of their lives. Now the GEs turn into major classes. By the end of their sophomore years, kids start getting valuable internship experience at real companies. They move off to the cities and hookup with other interns as well as going to bars if they are old enough. This happens every summer after sophomore year. 

By senior year, they get their job offers likely at the places they interned at. They may have a last hurrah after school by taking a holiday with their college buddies before work starts. At 22 they begin their first day at work.

There they rent out a sweet apartment and build a group of friends in the city. They may try online dating but they may also meet people. Also their friends get married and they begin to get invited to weddings as groomsmen. 

By their mid 20s they begin to slow down and think about settling down. While the girls hooked up quickily with their previous partners, they make their current partners wait because they aren't that kind of girl. The guys just commit knowing that the best days are behind them. Then by 29 for guys and 27 for girls they get married and have kids. Both together make at least 100k/year and their kids go through the same cycle. 

The religious crowd spends high school with one boyfriend/girlfriend. Then they go off to college and join cru. By 18 they meet their beloved significant other. Then they marry before they graduate and have kids upon graduation. 

I am far behind both those groups. It took me 6 years to complete school, and I still do not have a job lined up. Something about my personality or the way I look makes most girls run the other way. I tried online dating and while I was able to get dates, only one desperate girl wanted to see me again. Most girls just ran the other direction. I only had sex with 2 girls in my life. 

I just can't do it anymore. Even if I get my shit together, I will be 29 then and **way** too old for those nice religious girls. I most certainly **do not** want to marry some washed up Cock Carusal rider. 

If anyone mentions that I am a piece of shit for ""slut shaming"" then I will overdose and just be done with it knowing that people  just don't give a shit. 

I just want to end it all, take an eternal rest. 

edit: I am 26 years old. 

edit 2: sure my parents would be upset but my dad should realize that he shouldn't have married a small older woman. That is why I have autistic tendencies and a small frame. "

She also let me talk to other co-workers of hers with similar positions and then set up an interview for me with the HR director in charge of their summer internship program and we had a formal interview.

The interview went super well and I even learned that we attended the same high school. The HR director told me she would be in contact with me within 1-2 weeks and that I should contact her if she needs to move quicker incase I get another offer.

 My initial contact texted her friend who told my mom that they really liked me and that the contact was going to request me to be her intern. 

That all happened May 10th, since then I emailed my contact and thanked her (She said to let her know what happens with the internship) and I have emailed the HR Director twice, once to say thank you and the second to follow up.

I was supposed to be given a job by my internship place but later they decided they rather have trainee's to work for them because they are free.

I took a year long break to think what I want to do next and decided to apply to an education as processoperator in a steel factory. My father works there and adviced me to give it a try since I was always interested in that education when I was younger. I would go to school for 6 months and then start internship in one of the factories (it's a huge industry area which consists of many factories). I was a little skeptical if I would like it but in school I really enjoyed it. I was learning a lot of new stuff and I felt like I was good at it too. I passed all the exams with quite ease so I was motivated to start with the traineeship.

But once I started with my traineeship everything went pretty downhill. My mentor really doesn't communicate with me at all. I have to make tasks and essays and deliver them to my mentor every week. I've been doing this for the whole time but never got a reply back. Tried calling him every day, seemed like he just vanished. Then after a month he called me back and was like 'oh I was on vacation' and never bothered to let me know, great.. I'm behind schedule now while it's not my fault. I also can't get quite along with my collegues.. I feel like we are on a totally different 'level' and they are very rude. The first day of traineeship I introduced myself to everyone and most of them were just like 'oh... hi' and then they went outside for a smoke but never returned to me and instead just got to work. It made me feel ignored and I got quite frustrated.

I see myself as a really motivated guy but I just can't stand these guys and don't enjoy going to work at all. These guys keep on talking with eachother about how much they think their job sucks, why would you do that when there is a damn trainee around? and if they're not talking about that then it's about how they screwed their wifes last night, something I don't want to hear from a 50+ year old.

I'm really debating if I should quit.. the salary is really great and I do enjoy the work itself, but I really hate the people. I feel so stressed because I'm afraid that I'll be too old keep on trying new jobs. I'm 22 years old right now.

Hope somebody could give any advice.

I just finished my sophomore year at a target school studying CS. So this means intro, data structures, machine architecture (assembly), algorithms, artificial intelligence, and all the math that comes with CS. I have a good gpa (3.5+) and experience being a lab assistant in the intro classes. I got an internship this summer in silicon valley and am very happy with the salary. 


All that being said, I think I hate programming. Every time I do a project, I have feelings of anxiety and pressure that comes from not knowing how to do something. Every new technology/language I learn is a chore that's only learned because school is forcing me to and it's probably beneficial for my career. Having my first taste of industry, I realize that this field of software engineering may not be for me. I don't like (in fact I dread) learning new frameworks and languages, figuring things out how to do things haven't done before, being frustrated with bugs, and reading through documentation. So things that all programmers have to deal with all the time. I'm not sure if it's just laziness, but constantly feeling like I'm not sure what I'm doing puts myself in a state of anxiety and panic, and I really feel mental strain on my brain that makes me feel so tired at the end of the day. I also never have a desire to build anything outside of what I'm required to, so there's definitely no passion there. So based off of the fact that I don't like constantly learning new tools, detest reading through documentation, and being assigned things I don't know how to do, I'm seriously considering (and leaning towards) not programming for living. I don't say this lightly, as I come from a low income background and this would be a lucrative way to make a living and provide for my parents (I say this to show how much I've thought about this).


So, given all this, now what? I've spent two studying CS and have pushed my career towards software engineering. I still have two years left and lots of free time to go somewhere else (I'm done with all my breadths and only have a handful of CS classes to take). I think I'm lucky enough to have realized this now, while I still have time and flexibility. I'm down for a paycheck cut in exchange for sanity. Any advice/suggetions?"

hey guys. 
im a material science eng major doing the third year undergrad. 
ive been in the army for two years and forgot almost everything.
 i had a really hard time working up things this semester and not knowing what to do during summer ive decided to apply for a internship in one of the labs at school.

 i thought i wouldnt get it but suprisingly i got the internship(not that competitive tho). however i know literally nothing about the field

 from what i researched they do dram, reram, flash memory, tunnel fet? and so on. 

the thing is im not familiar with electric circuits nor semiconductors and any other parts related to this field. 

so im hoping to study by myself from scratch while doing the internship. can you guys recommend a textbook where i can learn the very basics?? If theres an online coursr you know it would be rreally helpful too

thanks!

tldr; pls recommend me a textbook on the fundamentals on semiconductor, flash memory or electrics in general tks :)"

I never had an internship and since the beginning of this year I have been looking for Software development roles. I accepted this IT job to pay the bills, get experience, and work through summer before the fall application season. 

I have let this company know during the hiring process several times that I am a new grad and looking for opportunity elsewhere. 

It's not such a bad thing then if I get an internship opportunity or developer position and leave this IT job as soon as I get a new, more favorable opportunity? And will IT work help me land an internship or developer position more easily than personal projects alone?"

As I'm about to start doing my master's degree, I'm thinking about making a change. I love my current workplace, but a huge problem is the old technologies, I program mainly in a subtype of BASIC (sure its a bit more modernised than basic BASIC, but it still won't look good on my resume).

I've made some sideprojects for the sake of having something nice on my resume, some python scripts, a clunky webpage with php backend and a primitive chatbot in java. I can't say I have a bad life now, the pay is good, the workplace is nice and stuff, but I'm worried that in longterm the old technologies will seriously hurt my possibilities. 


So here is my current plan: start my master's, in 2nd year enlist in ERASMUS (school exchange thing in europe) for a full year, try to get internships there and maybe even work. If all is well, maybe stay there to work. Currently I'm on the poorer side of Europe, salaries in 1st world countries seem much better. If not, return with a master's degree and get a new job with better technologies (something more commonly used).

Second option is to just change the workplace. I'm not sure, but it kinda puts me off thinking that I may have to deal with a lower salary, since my programming knowledge won't be deemed worthy in the hiring process.

Not sure what kinda advice I actually want, I guess I just want to hear some thoughts. That would be nice."

I recently applied to get into an IT-ready training program which is 8 weeks of fast track classes to get the CompTIA A+ certification followed by an apprenticeship/paid internship or another 8 weeks of training for another certificaiton.

I'm not sure I will get into this program so I am looking into alternatives. Has anyone been to a community college where they help you find work after you get your certificate or know of any program that does?

The one reason I like the IT-Ready program is they schedule you for interviews. I'm just wondering is there any other government or non government schools or some organization that helps place students after they get their certification?

For one they have cut themselves away from friends and relatives due to my grandmother's superiority complex. There is also the issue that they care a lot of what neighbors and the ""people"" will think of our actions and subsequently their actions.

My grandparents are my father's parents. My parents have been divorced for about 10 years. My mother's parents live in a different country. My father rarely sees us except when we are at our grandparents' . 

Even then, he doesn't *really* treat us as his children. There is some psychological abuse, especially during exams and the beginning of a new year. He also barely pays alimony. He ought to pay 300eu for each child ( we are 3 ) that gets increased by 10% every 2 years. This amounts to 1500eu monthly, he pays 600eu.

My grandparents know that he doesn't pay, they know that he cheated on my mother 3 times and had 2 babies. 

My grandparents, despite the way my father has treated my mother, my siblings and i , still give excuses for his behavior and become blind anytime the subject of his abuse comes up. It is understandable though, he is their child after all, 1 of the 2 that are alive. My grandparents like to think that they help us. 

In all of that ""help"" there is a lot of yelling, shouting, lack of basic privacy. They need to know everything that is going on, otherwise, all hell breaks lose. 

My mother is always on the receiving end of all this chaos. They either indirectly or through us.

My brother was almost beat because he replied ""I dont know so i can't answer"" on something my grandfather asked trying to find dirt to shit talk my mother.

I mentioned that there is lack of privacy, when i was working out, i had bought creatine which i left at a room in my grandparents', i was to start working out again and when i looked for my stuff, they were all gone. Somebody emptied them into the trash for whatever reason they justified. When i was dating my ex, they found the condoms i had stashed inside bags inside other bags and trashed them. There were times they tried to spy on me to see where i was going out for coffee. My grandfather was complaining that i shouldn't go to the gym because i will get raped (I am a 2m tall dude).

I am a university undergraduate. I am on my second year. I found an internship in a university institution with a manager that finished the university i am attending with a gpa of 3.9 and has a lot of publications and is working with the professor i want to supervise my thesis. The manager said that the internship might end up as permanent job while i am doing my studies. I am working on machine learning and cognitive software.My manager said that i could work anywhere i desired and at the times i desired as long as i met the deadlines.

My grandparents have issues with my work and were arguing with my mother about what kind of job is that and why am i going to the mall or anywhere to work besides an office or my home.

My grandparents find the tiniest thing to lash onto my mother and my siblings.

What can i do to deal with this?What can i do so that my grandparents don't lash onto my mother and siblings and start giving me and my mother some respect - which we have rightfully earned? My mother is finishing her second phd in machine learning and i am one of the most distinguished students in my class. My grandparents have highschool education and my grandfather was a teacher that got to a Principal 20 years ago.

For  clarification, we don't live with my grandparents, we live with mom.

I actually had a 4th interview yesterday, but it was more of a check to make sure I was who I said I was, and that I didn't have face tattoos or something that might make them not want to offer me a job.  

I got a very decent offer for where I live and my experience. I start in a couple weeks, and am terribly excited. Here are some facts for people in the market from my job search experience:  

*I have a 2 year degree in networking from a community college, 1.5 years of call center experience, 7+ years of retail with 3 of the years being as a manager. 0 IT experience outside of my basic homelab, and fixing family computers.
*I put in somewhere between 25 and 30 applications, all similar entry level positions. They ranged from wanting a high school diploma to a degree and 2 years of experience.  
*I had a call back from a recruiter I applied with that almost got me an interview. She talked to their HR and they had 2 slots for interviews. By the time I got back to her, both slots were filled.  
*The only other person to call back just offered me a position.  
*This position wanted 1+ years of experience.
*I interviewed over the phone with hr, then an IT person, then the lead IT guy and CIO (its not a huge company). Then had a face to face meeting at the local office.  

This position was one of the ones I was most excited about. It has good benefits, half the commute of most of the others, and isn't a typical boring HD1 position. I am amazed that I got the first position that I applied for!  

I had 2 other threads where I posted the questions I was asked (comments were ranging from ""That's way too detailed for hd1!"" to ""We ask interns those questions!""). I am happy to respond in PM questions and answers I gave. Beware that sometimes ""I'd google that"" was an answer to a technical question.  


This sub was a HUGE HELP to me. Thank you to everyone who asked their questions so I could see what other people said. Thank you to people responding to my questions and comments with helpful advise! I am grateful to get this position and start my career in IT, its something I have been working towards for 5 years. You guys rock!"

I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea how this works or what I'm doing so please excuse anything I say that is incorrect or sounds dumb. This is the situation: 

I am a 20 year old college student enrolled in Louisiana State University Shreveport's computer science curriculum pursuing my bachelors. I'm 2 years into my college education and have all of my general classes out of the way but have only taken a handful of computer science classes. I'm relatively computer savvy since I've planned on majoring in computer science since I was in middle school and have spent a lot of time tinkering but I only know the basics of programming in python/java and I haven't even touched other languages (other than HTML/CSS/JavaScript if those count as languages).

There seems to be a great internship opportunity at CSRA's Bossier location but I have no previous internships and the only thing I would be able to put on a resume is volunteer work I've done at a camp the past few years and my previous job as a runner at a law firm. I do know a guy who recently got his doctorate a few months ago and got a job doing research at CSRA and he had mentioned before without me even asking that he would be able to help me get an internship there because according to him they're always needing computer science people and ""he knows people"".

The issue is like I said above I don't have any experience or a whole lot of computer science classes under my belt. I know people say you'll never really feel ready for your first job/internship in your field and I believe that. I just don't want to get in over my head if I really am unqualified.

So I guess my question is can someone like me get an internship or should I focus on learning until I'm more qualified? Also I know this question is probably dumb... but how do I even go about applying?

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!"

I was wondering if colleges in general would hold this against me, even though my counselor would be able to explain it in their LOR.

or...

2) Ask my physics teacher if I can come in and independently study Physics C during one of his other periods. Assuming he said yes, it would probably be pretty hard but I think I could manage it. This would let me leave school for my internship last period and make it a lot smoother.

So basically I'm asking would the hit to my transcript be bad enough that I should try to do Physics C alone? Or would this be a question that's better suited for admissions officers of the specific schools I'm applying to? "

I've been spending time surfing forums online, looking through MOOC, browsing career articles, browsing/reading self-improvement or other books but am still without a real, actionable plan.

The root of the problem may be that I'm not 100% clear on what I want to do after graduation, possibly because I haven't touched enough of my EE/CS classes to know what I'd be happy/good at doing. I know that ideally I want to work with something innovative and cutting edge, be it in software engineering, embedded systems, robotics, nanotech, or anything related to CE that is changing the way we live, or solving big problems. This could be at a big name tech company, in humanitarian work, automotive industry, big data, I may even freelance, who knows. All I know is I want to do something exciting but currently I'm not on track for something that prestigious, hence me posting this. 

I also need to do something to generate some income while going to school, to help out at home. That's where I'm confused. I'm currently underqualified for any of the fancy internships my peers may be doing, but I'd like to change that within this year, hence this post. So should I just get some odd job for money, and continue to go to school, self study and do projects until I narrow down my career goals, and then shoot for more focused jobs/internships? Should I bother with any IT jobs or certifications as a temporary job even if I don't plan to work in IT long term? I've applied for some entry level part-time IT jobs; if I get one, how can i prepare if I have no experience? 

 As far as side-projects and self learning using MOOC's like Udacity, I was thinking just go one by one on intro courses for things I'm interested in (Mobile dev, robotics, AI, Python, Data Science), and then take the more advanced courses in things I find more interesting, building my portfolio along the way. Would becoming a jack of all trades, master of none through this be a bad thing in the tech industry? Any other recommended approach?

Anyway, I got myself thinking about how I don't have a goal or a direction after a conversation from my classmate who sent out job application forms as early as a 4th year to triple A gaming companies such as Square Enix, etc. because he wanted to be a game developer and to other I.T. companies thru the jobstreet website. He didn't get accepted because he said the qualifications were high and were more or less catered to I.T. graduates. Though I admire his passion, I'm also envious of him since I don't really have that much passion and I don't have lofty dreams like him. He tries to improve his skills in 3D Modelling, practicing stuff in Unreal Engine, coding in C#, doing circuits in his spare time etc. Basically, he does a lot of extracurricular activities in his spare time.

I myself am motivated when it comes to coding, though I tried 3D Animation once due to inspiration at those guys who make SFM videos, I felt I was forcing myself to do it and eventually stopped. I'm easily distracted when it comes to extracurricular activities but I can keep my grades high and only had a single failed subject throughout my 4 years in college. I haven't done that much extra hobbies like him and certainly didn't send out job resumes to different websites but because of this, I feel really inadequate and feel like I should be doing something in my free time.

Then again, I feel like I'm trying to compare myself to him too hard. Add also the realization that I don't have any concrete future plans for myself, I really feel like I'm screwed even when I graduate.

I would like to document my difficulties, which compared to many, are trivial. However, I would require advice to these individual questions.

1) My senior had told me sometimes I had been too straightforward with my words and may have hurt others. I see the point of this. I have an overly 'righteous' mindset, to an obsession where I simply cannot tolerate certain behaviours. From there I will begin my scathing remarks/ sarcasms.

2) My frustration. Sometimes I wished I was doing more work, which I have to, in my schedule. But having to coordinate with others meaning, I cannot just simply carry out. Hence, I have found myself having more free time. I would like to read, but my office isn't conducive enough to do so.

3) I am not street smart enough. Here, I have seen office politics between the hierachy. I don't feel I'm smart enough to play the game - on what to do. Also, I don't feel competent enough at work. We used to have senior who was an all-rounder, extremely capable. A jack of all trades. He could do everything he was tasked to perfectly. I was a follower, admiring at his leadership abilities. Now I'm the senior in my office, I don't even feel 10% of his capabilities - despite my superiors have high hopes for me.

4) Lack of self-confidence. I feel carefree talking to people I'm comfortable with. However, with new people, I often feel being unable to catch up with others even when they talk or joke with me. I do not know how to react or engage in a conversation. I have very few good friends. A good friend of mine who is studying in a top college has been achieving, talking his financial ambitions and applying for internships. I have found difficulty catching up- lack of knowledge of what he is trying to share with me, not knowing many terms. As much as I would love to learn, I find difficulty.

5) I try to read. I'm trying to catch up with this year's Economist Issues. I've found difficulty in understanding what they write in their articles at times. I ponder whether my comprehension skills are poor. (My English can only be said to be mediocre at best, or worse) I want to learn more about economics (having learnt it in school) and investing.

6) An overall profile with myself. I enjoy doing physical training and running with my superiors and peers in the weekdays. I enjoy work. However, my relationships have barren. I only have 1 or 2 good friends where I still keep in touch with, many friendships have long faded or have grown sour in the past. On the affair of other ""relationships"", I have not spoken to any females for say, a year and a half. Ever since graduation from my pre-university college. And I no longer have friends from there after a sour relationship with them. Life has been barren without females in my life, I never thought so when I enjoyed all my moments with my guy friends, taking their presence for granted and rarely speaking to them. The closest time I had with a female was several years back. She was adorable, cheerful and joyous. Her looks had initially caught my eye. But getting to know her personally made me fall for her even more. However, it had an ending which was sinister. A nightmare which resulted from me and my insecurities. Now life being barren without a girl, sometimes she comes to my mind after all these years. Worse still, my overall social life is a disaster. Other than doing physical training with my peers in the weekdays, I have no hobbies to keep me occupied, or to spark converations with. I am a very generic person, with average or below-average looks, wasting away my weekend at home, looking at my computer for porn (albeit without fapping, in my entire life) or sleep my weekend away. I wish for more opportunities I can go out with people, having activities I could occupy my time with, having a girl to do things together. Yet, I struggle to initiate or sustain a conversation with girls, and now, I don't even have a chance of meeting someone I may like.

20 years of my life. I'm going to university next year. I'm full of flaws, my life is rotting and I need serious help.

I've a bit of a detailed question here, I'll try to give as much information as possible. I'm not looking for a definitive answer or anything of the sort, but maybe someone with a better perspective of the web developer job market can assist me here. 

I started an unpaid internship in March last year, being in my second year of uni. My task was to upgrade a CRUD GUI the company used called opensips on tomcat 4 to be compatible with tomcat 7. After completing this, I went on to rewrite the entire application in struts2 using hibernate ORM for the database queries. After this, I was offered to be ""paid upon delivery"" with the next jobs. I added regex input validations (ip, phone number validations etc.), multiple inserts into different tables with one action using HttpRequest, a login system (Apache Shiro) with permission checks and some other stuff like translating inputs into their regex equivalents and so on. 

I then decided to drop my course as I enjoyed web dev and I was struggling with my final year anyway. I completed 3 java courses, I figured that would at least stand to me should I ever apply somewhere. 

I started a company with a friend and wrote a survey application together with him in ruby on rails. The survey is for a HR company who want to use the data for employee performance analysis. I had no experience in Ruby on Rails (nor did I in web development apart from my internship) and we accomplished that. It has a login, a CSV import function for users along with some other features such as allowing the user to go back and change their answer. It's pretty robust IMO and written entirely from scratch.

At the moment I'm porting an open source asset management system in PHP for the same company I did my internship with. I've had to manipulate the views a little and add a CSV parser in PHP that translates the CSV into something that can be processed by the application. 



I know this is all very vague, I'm trying to give a tl;dr. I did three Java courses in university, and I want to go for a Spring developer job. I've looked at postings online and a lot are saying a degree is required. If I came into your company and applied, what would you say? Also, if I have to demo code to a company on github, could I get in trouble legally for posting what is essentially property from a company I worked for? Should I ask permission? what is the general procedure with posting your code on git? Any answers would be much appreciated."
6hhrgf,4,2017-06-15,"Starting the journey to getting diagnosed. Rants, feelings, and questions [F27]",PiratesARGH,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6hhrgf/starting_the_journey_to_getting_diagnosed_rants/,"As per usual around here, this is long but I just need to share my feelings to people who get it:

Well, here we are. I'm confirmed for my appointment that I had initially canceled to get tested for ADHD. My insurance isn't covering it since I haven't met my deductible. I panicked and wasn't sure if I wanted to front the $500 estimate if she was just going to tell me I'm a lazy piece of shit. I'm scared and mad and hopeful at the same time. I'm self-employed, so the past year and a half, money has been cyclical. I need to realize that the $500 is an investment to stop the cycle. I need to invest in my mental health.

The receptionist mentioned an online test? Am I just sitting in front of a computer or am I actually sharing my experiences with a psychiatrist while taking a test? Any advice on what to expect would be great. I'm reading through posts and absorbing as much as I can.

I'm still trying to process that this may be the answer to my problems. That I don't just have quirky character flaws. That this is not normal. I was told I was smart but didn't apply myself. I was disorganized. ADHD were the annoying boys in class who would disrupt the teacher and fidget in class. No, no, my constantly being reprimanded for talking to other students wasn't the same thing, right? I skated by in high school and college and had a boring job right out of school. Now I'm self-employed and I know I can be more successful than I am and I'm getting in my own way. It's fucking infuriating.

I used to joke in college that taking Adderall recreationally made me feel ""normal"" and now it's not so funny. I talked to some of my colleagues about how they find motivation and more people I knew were diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. Maybe something to mention to my physician?

So I did that last week. I was nervous because I knew I had liked the feeling of Adderall and saying ""other people recommended it"" sounded, well, as bad as it sounds. She didn't feel comfortable diagnosing me but she said I should get tested. She prescribed me Wellbutrin in the meantime, which I had never heard of. And then I found you.

I don't know why it didn't click before. I don't know why I just assumed I'm lazy and that's it. I took a quiz for symptoms of ADHD in Women and I burst into tears. ""Wondering how normal people do it"" is something I think about every day. Feeling overwhelmed and directionless. Feeling like my thoughts are going a mile a minute. Panicking at the thought of people seeing how messy my house is.

I don't know if it's the Wellbutrin (the pharmacist said it could take 3 weeks to feel anything?), an incredibly stressful work week, PMS (hello, gentlemen), or a combination of all 3 but I've been in a weird fog since I started down this rabbit hole of reading what ADHD really is and not my preconceived notions. I've had some outbursts of anger. I will cry reading what you all have gone through. Feeling exhausted. Resentful.

It's been a rough day. I've been replaying the failures in my life and what my life could be like if I had known all of this before. Even if I don't get diagnosed next week, I could have tried 15 years ago to help some of the issues I was experiencing. I can't stop this rush of painful memories. My struggles through Math class in HS to the point of panic attacks. My mother telling me how disappointed she was in me at my graduation; I left HS with a 2.9 GPA and 3.0 made the graduation brochure. How my grades slipped and my focus struggled after being sexually assaulted in college. If I had my shit together, would I have even met my rapist? No, no, no, can't think like that. Feeling like a failure for not getting the right internships and subsequently the wrong job out of college. I've been telling myself how unworthy I am of love for a year because my boyfriend doesn't deserve to live with a lazy slob.

I read a post here today about not being able to stop talking (hello ^ ) and I will literally scream in my head to shut up while I'm talking to clients. I am my own worst enemy. And so I cried about that. And then laid out a barrage of feelings to my boyfriend who said he supports me but it was a lot to process during his lunch. Shut. Up. Just leave people alone who are busy because they know how to prioritize in life. We can talk in person later. And there's just something about me that I just have to speak.

I also really, really appreciated the post today about the reminders of why you can't be mad about the past. I needed that today so thank you.

I'm feeling hopeful for the future. I'd love to hear about your experiences getting diagnosed. I'm also concerned about Wellbutrin but I'm also thinking I just ride out this wave of emotions as I adjust. Did anyone else experience this? And I'd also love to connect with more ladies to hear how they've managed some of their personal and professional relationships with ADHD.

Thank you, all! I'm subscribing and learning as I go!

**TLDR; A release of a 20-something's feelings as she prepares to possibly get diagnosed next week and working through the emotions that come with that. Also, Wellbutrin?**"

6hhu3x,2,2017-06-15,Relocated for a job and then let go after 3 months,workmeow12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6hhu3x/relocated_for_a_job_and_then_let_go_after_3_months/,"Like the title says, I moved half way across the country for a job as an engineer at a consulting company. My SO moved with me, we signed a lease for an entire year, and I paid for most of the original moving expenses myself. I have had no complaints about my work performance, however the company was in a lull and a project that I was supposed to be on fell threw (the client went with another company). I am now in California, with an expensive lease, no friends or family, and few job prospects. 

I plan to apply for as many relevant jobs as possible, but it was difficult to get a job in the first place. I had an 8 month engineering internship while I was in school and decent research experience. However my GPA was not great (3.05). I have a small amount of savings and I plan to apply for unemployment. Unfortunately, as I have only worked for the company for 3 months, I will likely not qualify for a substantial amount (unemployment in California is based on the previous four quarters). 

I am sad and angry. I did not particularly want to relocate, but it was a good offer and in my desired industry. I have requested a letter of recommendation from the president of the company and he agreed, so hopefully he will follow through with that. I was told that I was let go due to the financial situation of the company, which is not doing as well as they had hoped.

I don't know what to do at this point. Do I put the job on my resume? I don't have any contacts in California that I could leverage for finding a job elsewhere. Having applied for hundreds of online positions during my time as a student, I know how futile online applications can be. Where should I go from here? Any advice would be appreciated. "
6hi1ty,1,2017-06-15,Finishing medical school in debt,[deleted],PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/6hi1ty/finishing_medical_school_in_debt/,"So. I am finishing medical school in Europe and like other medical students will graduate with tremendous debt (with the total approaching $150,000 including personal loans I don't have to deal with immediately). While I have had help from wonderful people in later years there came points where I had to live off of credit cards. Now it's time to deal with them so I don't continue losing thousands in interest.

This coming year I will be working as an intern in the UK making approximately $40,000. While this figure will obviously grow for now it's what I have to work with. The National Student Loan Service Centre will take approximately $7,500 of this as I do not qualify for the 20% cap while working abroad. Living expenses in my town are high and I will not have all that much left at the end of each month. But what do I do with that little bit?

Aside from a low interest student line of credit and very, very low interest credit card I have ~$4500 at 12% and $6000 at 25%. A personal line of credit would be a good solution but banks don't seem interested if you are working abroad (based on my having spoken to several). I am thinking balance transfers to either a credit union's or my undergraduate school's MasterCard. Ideally I'd place all my high interest credit card debt in one account but I doubt any bank will gamble &gt;$10000 on me at low rates.

Having never had a household income above $30,000 these are all imaginary numbers to me. You might as well add a zero to each figure for all that I can manage it on my own. Really, I could use some advice. The Canadian Medical Association advertises that students &amp; interns abroad can get help from a financial adviser. It's not easy for me to contact them though. One call ended with the rep telling me students abroad do not in fact qualify. Another ended with being told that I need to buy bonds or stocks through them before I qualify for an adviser (which seems the opposite order to me). Finally a call ended with a promise to be contacted but this contact did not materialize.

Any input is very much appreciated. All I can offer is my gratitude (and maybe reddit gold) but you'd be doing someone a real favour."

I'm currently studying for a civil engineering degree and as part of our program we get to do a 9 month internship and I'm hoping to pursue one in South America. Chile would be number one option simply due to the fact I have a few good friends from there and have really enjoyed hearing what they've had to say about life there. With that said, I'm also very open to any South American country as I simply just want to discover more about Latin-American culture.

One of my main concerns is my level is Spanish, which is probably around early intermediate level and certainly not good enough to jump straight into a Spanish-speaking job. So with that said, would anyone here happen to know about the prevalence of English speaking engineering jobs in Chile and other South American countries or how easy it is to pick up internships like this? I'm also very open to the idea of working in Brazil, although my level of Portuguese is almost zilch. I'm very keen to pick up another language though!"
6hiagk,83,2017-06-15,Strategies for getting off the waitlist at your dream school,novembrr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6hiagk/strategies_for_getting_off_the_waitlist_at_your/,"I just got an email from one of my students that she was just accepted off the waitlist at an Ivy League, having received a phone call from the dean. There's still hope for you guys!

How'd she do it? And how did my students from past years get accepted off the waitlist at Princeton, MIT, UChicago, Penn, Berkeley, Tulane, and more?

Obviously you can do what past accepted students have done (like u/ketoke) and [create something unbelievably cool and creative](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/617c9w/how_i_got_off_57_waitlists_or_how_i_colored_my/). I'm not that artistically talented and most of my students aren't that incredibly creative. So I recommend the persistent email route for all those who cannot draw, sing or tap dance their way off the waitlist. Emailing the general admissions email account is rarely successful; however, emailing the two people most crucial to your acceptance off the waitlist can make all the difference. 

**How do I get their email, you ask? Three methods have proven successful for me.** 

1) Some universities list counselors by region, such as [Columbia](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/columbia_counselor_update_2016-17.pdf) and [UChicago](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/contact). Unfortunately Columbia has already released their waitlisted students, so my advice comes too late for you folks. But many other universities still have students on their waitlists. If you find yourself waitlisted, Google ""[university name] admissions counselors by region"" and see what insight you can drum up from the university's own webpage.

2) Some universities tell you your regional counselor but don't provide you a method for contacting them. So, how do you find their email address? One possible method is by going to the university's directory. Some may be locked to use by only students and faculty members, but many others are open to the general public if you know your regional counselor or the dean's first and last names.

3) What to do if those other two methods fail? Download the Chrome extension [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) and head over to LinkedIn. Search for ""Yale admissions,"" etc., and search through the list of folks you find, looking for individuals who either explicitly say their are the admissions counselor for your region or just look higher up in the office. Better yet, find the dean of admissions. Hunter.io will provide their best guess for the individual's email address, based on a web search for that individual or other people similar to them in a particular organization. If you find a potential email, fire away an email and cross your fingers that it reaches the person in charge of your application! 

**What do you tell them in your email? I have a template for that which I recommend that my students (and you, too) deeply personalize.**
 
Dear [title of position + last name],
 
Last week I met an alum, talked to a professor, discovered some cool program or tradition at school. Be specific, don't just generally say ""I talked to a current student"". Example: ""Yesterday, I talked with Sarah Smith, BA'19, about Stanford's many entrepreneurial opportunities of which she has taken advantage. I was incredibly impressed that she has taken classes taught by [entrepreneur], connected with students from the D School and engineering departments to launch her own startup prototype, and even had the opportunity to pitch her startup to investors from X, Y, and Z firms. I did not think it was possible, but it made me like Stanford even more!""
 
""My name is [first + last name] and I am a waitlisted applicant from [high school]. While most people would be disappointed to be waitlisted by [university], I was incredibly excited—for it gives me a greater opportunity to prove to [university] Undergraduate Office of Admissions that [university] is my first choice and I would greatly contribute to the [descriptor] atmosphere."" 
 
[Go into greater detail about that NEW piece of information. It can be something small or large, but it must be new and interesting. You won an award, ended the school year with great grades, you got to do something cool with your internship, your club just raised $X, you were named valedictorian, etc. You can stretch this ""new"" quality, too, by just saying you learned something new that reinvigorated your passion for learning. I.e.: ""In psych class we recently learned about [whatever]. It made me look at the topic of psychology with fresh eyes. I am now interested in minoring in psychology. I explored Harvard's psychology website and discovered [something cool] and I would love to pursue this program/minor/internship/class in the future.]

""If accepted off the waitlist, I would absolutely attend.""

[Now is your last chance for acceptance off the waitlist, so throw ALL options at them: that you're willing to take a gap year, a guaranteed sophomore year transfer (Cornell offers this, some other universities might be willing), spring semester start date (Berkeley offers this), etc. For example: ""I would also consider taking a gap year if that is the difference needed to make [university] a reality. Please let me know if there is any way that I might one day be a [university] student.""
 
""I know you are incredibly busy, and I greatly appreciate your time. I am very excited about the possibility that I may attend [university] in the future, and wish you a restful summer.""

Sincerely,

[First + last name]

[High school] 

**Final thoughts**

By now, you've probably come to terms with attending the school to which you deposited. If you haven't, you need to do so. But you also shouldn't give up on your dream school if you have been waitlisted (unless you have fallen newly in love with the school to which you deposited, of course). If you give up, you'll never get accepted off the waitlist. But you might as well send one final email and see how it goes. You may be lucky and be like my student, who cannot believe she just got offered admission to her dream Ivy League university.

P.S. Are you a sophomore and junior and need more advice on your unique situation? PM me and I'll do my best to help!

Edit: I originally included USC in my examples, but I confirmed emails with my past student and she was accepted off an appeal, not off the waitlist. USC does not waitlist. Thanks for the correction, u/microappleseed! "
6hj4lt,30,2017-06-15,"Interning with a large defense company, position was misrepresented. Should I quit, or..??",Bear-Tamer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6hj4lt/interning_with_a_large_defense_company_position/,"So I have two part time campus jobs that total up to 17-19 hours a week in the evenings:

* Full Stack developer, where I am rebuilding internal financial systems and webapps from scratch (Node/Express/React-Redux - love it!).
* Datacenter Engineer, where I work on some infrastructure automation stuff, but am in a huge slump and clock only an hour a week.

This week, I started an internship with a large aerospace company (rhymes with boring). I was really hesitant about it because I was matched up to a more project management oriented position in IT change management, but my target career space is DevOps post-grad, so I figured I could make it work.

So I've started, and my team is completely unprepared. They had no idea who I was, and refused to fill out my onboarding paperwork and internship plan. On my first day, a couple of team members came to our office and started talking about how they've been forced to re-org, and were terminated. They now have to apply for the same job in Arizona at a lower salary.

I did some investigation into their pain points while doing video training, and found out they hired me so that I can automate some of their ERP system work. Thing is, there are no API hooks for those systems. I cracked at my environment, only to realize google/yahoo searches are firewalled, and I can't use anything open sourced. There's no documentation about tooling, our internal repos, our security certs, etc.

So I hit up the company forums and started ripping decade-old projects that people have posted for troubleshooting. I reached out to a couple of developers, thinking that if I could bootstrap an initial project, everything will be okay. All of them have ignored me except for one, who just told me that they use ASP .NET MVC.

I've been trying as hard as I can to get my leadership and colleagues to connect me with another developer too so we can get their projects running, but I ended up having to outright fight with them. After a couple of days, they managed to get me a 30-minute appointment with a developer, one of the ones that refused to talk to me in our department.

Anyways, my being here feels entirely inappropriate. I asked to be on a different team when interviewing but was matched anyways, and the position was flagrantly misrepresented. Without any sort of baseline or docs I can't develop in an environment that's so locked down. We're essentially using each other at this point - They want me to be some crazy rockstar and hit the ground running without any support, and I really just want the work history.

Should I stick this out, or quit? And by quit, I mean ask the intern coordinator for re-assignment - it's worth a shot at least since other, more technical groups are struggling hardcore right now. Thoughts on what to do, and strategies for doing so professionally, would be super helpful.

**EDIT:** I was asked by my lead to circumvent some internal policies to avoid having to add test cases and security audits to this project. Received a lot of push back when I disagreed. Reported everything to the intern program admin and left, not sure if I still have the position.

**EDIT 2:** Confirmed that the purpose of the internship was to sidestep requirements and security policies. Made an ethics report and formally resigned. Unrelated, I was promoted in my other position."
6hkmh9,2,2017-06-16,ME graduate but interest is in software and progamming - go back to school?,Starky_D,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6hkmh9/me_graduate_but_interest_is_in_software_and/,"So I recently graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering (with internship experience, school projects, etc).  It was kind of my pipe dream of pursuing my automotive interests (I still haven't given up) but things haven't worked in my favour.  Living thousands of kilometers away from the closest automotive manufacturing market in Canada and graduating from a mediocre school definitely didn't help.

Another big passion of mine was software programming; I really enjoyed it in my first year and did really well in the entry level coding courses.  I did a lot of C/Python/Matlab programming during my internship and have some personal Arduino projects.  

So I guess it's no surprise that most of the jobs I've been applying to are not the traditional 'ME' jobs.  Honestly I've probably applied to more Software engineering jobs than mechanical, which is stupid.  So that brings me to my dilemma:  I feel if I had a software engineering degree I would have *so* many more options in terms of jobs and opportunities, especially those that I would enjoy.

Would it be worth it to spend another 3, possibly 4 years in school pursuing a software engineering degree?  Or can I do work on my own to tailor my resume to more software related jobs (self taught programming etc).  The thing that bothers me the most is that I feel as though my experience and knowledge from mechanical engineering would almost be useless if I swapped to software.  

I guess I just feel a little hopeless right now and would love some advice or guidance from those who have been in a similar position as me. 

Thanks all!"

What do I do?",Vanguard470,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6hm7pv/no_inputs_at_work_feel_like_im_stagnating_but_i/,"I'm in IT and have been with my company for about 5 years. I had a supervisor who also had some knowledge of IT who helped me get started as an intern. He left after I was there about a year and I went from intern - part time - full time in that year. I knew the job would be mostly self lead and that was fine when things were happening and there was technology goals in mind.

Now that my supervisor is gone, I report to the office manager and CEO and neither of them know much about IT. For a long time, the CEO would give me an idea of a project he was having and I would put things together like business plans, ROI analysis, and other project management type functions. If he liked what he saw, he would give me the go ahead and I would plan it out and implement it. I've gotten my hands on some fun technology and projects because of that. However, lately that's slowed way down and I haven't done much of anything lately besides ironing out a few bugs in a system I set up. I feel like most days, I'm just sitting at my desk trying to come up with things to do or work on and thanking the lord when someone breaks something.


I'm 25 and wonder if I should be moving on or stick it out. There is some interesting things that are likely to happen in the next few months but I don't know how they'll affect me if at all. I'm worried if I can't get something up and going in the meantime though that'll it will damage my reputation for good work ethic more than it'll help me.

I have an interest in Web Development and have been teaching myself but don't feel I'm anywhere near ready to start working in it.

I am a current PhD student in a CS program and I have decided that I will be leaving my program with a Masters. I however won't be getting that degree until the end of the Fall semester. I’ll no longer be able to be a TA or RA, so obviously I have to get a job to support myself. For my job search, I’m wondering if I should pursue an internship or just bypass that since I already have a B.S. I’m only one class short and it will be research credit with my adviser so I won’t have any class time commitments. 

How does this situation look to recruiters? And does this look different between an internship vs part time vs full time position?

Some additional information, I don’t have any previous internship experiences, but I have several years of research (with publications) plus several years at a Help Desk during my undergrad.

Thanks in advanced."

I just started a Helpdesk intern job at a large company, and one of my coworkers asked me to do research on LAPS to see if it would be a good fit for implementing here. I'm still very inexperienced in the field so my knowledge on this stuff leaves a lot to be desired, so I wanted to ask a question or two here to you guys.

My coworker wants to know if we can set one single local admin password across all machines and change that password globally as we need to by using LAPS? Or is LAPS specifically designed for giving different machines their own individual admin password? If so, what is a good alternative for what we want?

Ideally, LAPS is far more secure than what they're asking for, which is to just have one admin password for all machines that we can easily change, but for the time being I suppose that's enough (though the cybersecurity major in me dies a little bit inside thinking about it.)

Thanks much"

I've had it since I was a kid, and I'm borderline manic when I'm off of meds. I went a few years without taking anything so I know somewhat how to function without them. since I've went into school though I've been on vyvanse.

I am a double major in mathematics and computer science. I have mostly A's with 3 B's, 1 C and coming up on 90 hours. Right now I'm working at an internship while taking psychology and Cal 3 online. I really enjoy programming, and playing around with technology in general. 

I'm not looking for experiences of people with ADHD who work in the field, I know they are there. I've read the experiences of people who both don't take medication, and take it on a regular basis. I'm looking for the experiences of people who were taking it, and for whatever reason got off of it. How did it affect your school life or career? How did you deal with the adjustment period of acclimating to life without meds? How would you rate your productivity before and after?

If possible I would like to quit taking them, but not at the expense of my ability to pursue my goals. "
6ho3g4,6,2017-06-16,I'm really struggling...,UsernameRealEstate,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6ho3g4/im_really_struggling/,"Honestly, sometimes I get into these trains of thought where I think maybe I don't have ADHD, maybe I'm making this up. But then I see how other people work, I see how other people's lifestyles are and I can't help but be ridiculously jealous. I'm a mechanical engineering student and I for the life of me cannot complete quality homework on time, I just can't. I have never been able to do homework or school work in a timely manner and it has been the bane of my existence since I was a child.

I really hate how people stereotype woman engineers, I was at a celebration dinner for this program I'm involved with at my school and this guy was talking to me and a few other women engineers about how meticulous women engineers are and how good we are at organizing. That is the COMPLETE opposite of me and now that I can't live up to that stereotype I wonder if I can even find a job someday, much less an internship.

My ADHD gives me crippling self esteem issues. I don't have conversations like normal people, I have a terrible TERRIBLE habit of interrupting people when they are talking because I get really excited and worked up when talking. I go on HUGE rants about the most seemingly uninteresting things. Recently someone I work with at school told me I'm borderline annoying because I talk too much. That really hurts to hear, it really hurts to think I'm this unorganized mess of a person who can't get their shit together. Every aspect of my life suffers because of this disorder, my car is a disgusting mess and in desperate need of an oil change, I lose everything, I can't socialize very well at all, most work environments are distracting, I get my shifts covered at work a lot because I'm easily overwhelmed, my GPA is piss poor (2.8).

6ho68c,1,2017-06-16,"How do I get myself on a ""career path""?",RuafaolGaiscioch,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6ho68c/how_do_i_get_myself_on_a_career_path/,"I haven't really tried to talk about this much, but I'm nearing the end of my rope, and I just don't know what to do or how to do it. If this isn't the right place to put this, or if there's some sidebar information that answers all my questions, mods feel free to delete the post. I just need to ask for help, and I honestly don't even know where to start.

I am 29 years old, with a college degree, and I have been unemployed for one year. I was working in the service industry making enough to support myself but not much more, and last summer I hurt my back. The doctors say that if I keep working manual labor jobs, I will keep messing up my back, so that's a major avenue of work that is shut off to me. I've been sending out applications to nearly everything that I'm qualified for in my area, but I almost never hear back, and when I do it doesn't amount to anything.

As far as I know, I'm smart. Like, have consistently been the smartest person in most rooms I walk into, by other's estimation and not my own. I've never fallen outside the 99th percentile in any test I've ever taken. Every single person I know would and has called me the smartest person that they know. It's hard for me to say that, because the very idea of mentioning that you are smart on the internet is almost immediate confirmation that it is not true. I'm mentioning it in context of honesty, though, not to make myself feel better. It makes me feel worse, in fact, because if I am as smart as I've always thought and always been told, why am I an abject failure.

I am college educated, but that degree (English, Creative Writing) took me 8 years and a bad grades induced transfer to get. Part of that time was because I needed above a 2.0 to graduate, so the last year of classes were all superfluous classes designed to push my GPA up to an illustrious 2.01. I do believe a great deal of the reason for that is my extreme irresponsibility and immaturity at 18 when I was in college, and I think if I went to school at 25 it would have been very different. I have never had an internship. I have never worked outside the food service industry, or in any capacity that would in any way test or display my intelligence/abilities. In short, I look absolutely terrible on paper.

In terms of my interests, I have been writing for over a decade, I am (big surprise) deeply mired in ""geek"" culture, and I pay close and passionate attention to current events. I would love to be able to work in any number of industries: television, journalism, game design, politics, criticism, academia. I have absolutely no clue how I would be able to break into any of those areas, though, and sending out applications seems to be useless. I have been writing scripts for several years now, with the desire to have my brother (who lives in Hollywood and works in film finance) to sell them to someone, but I recognize writing scripts on the hopes of making it ""big"" isn't exactly a stable life path.

I recognize that I can get a job at Dunkin Donuts or the local movie theater. Soon, since I can't make my fiance support us much longer, I'm going to have to settle for such a thing, but I don't want to. I feel like I am at a crucial crossroads in my life, and if I do settle for another truly dead-end position like that, that's it, I'll be stuck on the lowest echelon of society, never realizing any of my supposed potential. I don't know what I can do now though. I can't take an internship, because a) I'm 29 years old and b) if I don't start contributing in a real way soon, we're going to lose the roof over our heads. I can't go back to school because money, and even then, I don't know what aim that would be towards anyway. I live in a relatively rural area, which means there isn't a huge excess of jobs in the first place, but I don't have the financial means to up and move to a city on the idea that I might be able to find a job, and nothing outside my area that I've applied for has even responded with a rejection email.

This whole post is inspired by several things. My parents, who are extremely wealthy, have been pushing harder and harder for me to get a job, not realizing or caring that I'm doing everything I can. My fiance at her job was talking to HR about getting me work at her company, and was rebuked because I have, as they said, ""no relevant experience whatsoever."" Finally, I read one sentence in an article related to my hobbies this morning that made me break down crying: ""Life's twists and turns led to a career in game design, which led back to where I began—thinking about Magic all day."" I cried because I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about, life's twists and turns leading to a career in game design. I feel like all these people, all around, my age and younger, know how to navigate the world in a meaningful way and get positions that I would dream about working in, and I'm here stagnating.

The main complaint I hear from my peers in terms of career is that they don't know what they want to do or be. My fiance, in particular, is just working a desk job to do it, and doesn't really know what she wants to strive for, but she has 4 years of relevant administrative experience and has been supporting us with that. I, on the other hand, know exactly what I want to do, plenty of things I want to do. I want to write for TV, design games, speechwrite, work for the news, criticize films and TV. I have all sorts of ideas of what I could do, and absolutely no idea how to get there, especially from where I am now. Help."
6ho6jt,90,2017-06-16,I'm an Introvert and am having a hard time getting job.,basketballphilosophy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6ho6jt/im_an_introvert_and_am_having_a_hard_time_getting/," I graduated last August with a master's degree in Economics at the University where I also got my BA. But I have had little luck in getting a job. I've had over 10 in person Interviews, maybe close to 30 phone interviews, have had second rounds, and even taken tests for some jobs. GPA for both degrees were over 3.5 but I only had one 9 month internship.

I grew up with social anxiety and naturally spent most of my college years learning to overcome that. It was one of the reasons I enrolled in my advanced BA-MA because so much of my BA years were spent doing my best dealing with those personal issues such as depression and anxiety (I also was a double major and commuted everyday to campus). I did not know exactly where to start my career so I figure  an extra year education would help. And in that year as a grad student I did my internship.

Any tips for a natural introvert to do better at his next interview?  Can't help but feel it's just me and that I'm just a pretty reserved person. I expanded my job search to include jobs that don't require degrees.

I've also dealt with some critical feedback from employers. ""That you're too academic"", ""overqualified and we're scared you will get bored"", ""you're smart, but there are alot of smart people. The difference is someone gives a good interview"".

6hoad2,0,2017-06-16,Am I screwed?,2TitanUp7,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/6hoad2/am_i_screwed/,"So I wasn't able to get accepted into the program for fall because I don't have a strong enough CS background.  I have my BS in actuarial science (3.97 GPA, 3 exams passed) and then have been working for the past year and a half or so as a software developer.  The problem is that the actuarial curriculum was more math and finance heavy and only had a few actual courses on computer science (the rest was learning online and in internships).  While this was enough to land a basic job, I'd really like to get into machine learning and working more with data than the web development that I'm basically doing now.

It seems like the only way to get into machine learning is to have a master's or you can't even get a foot in the door, but my problem is that I can't even get a foot in the door to get into any grad schools.  It's clear that I need to take some more UG level courses in CS, but none of the schools around me will take students for second BS (san diego area) in CS or offer any kind of certificate.  I'd really like to not spend another 4 years/$120,000 to get another sheet of paper on a bunch of curriculum, some of which I'd be taking for a second time.

Am I screwed because I made a decision when I was 18 to pursue something that I ended up not liking and now can't go back to school for what I would like to do?  It seems like every accredited online option costs tons of money...just to have to roll right into spending a ton more on grad school all the while, I wouldn't be able to work during any of that time because I'd have to be a full time student to do any of this in a reasonable time frame. Do I have any options that don't cost a ton, take forever and require me to retake material I already know (does anywhere let you test out?)?

I'm starting to lose it since I can't find answers or options to this anywhere and every school in the area I've called has given me nothing.  Is the landscape basically, if you don't major in CS out of high school, forget about grad school because that's what it seems like.

Edit:
Here is what I have/what I mentioned in my SOP.
Courses in college: Intro to java programming, database design
MOOC courses: various web dev courses, Coursera data structures and algorithms specialization, a couple python courses
Built one fairly large app for a friend to track and send workouts to his athletes for a number of sports, but we never taken past a minimum usability standpoint for him which I mentioned
I also noted what I intended to do with the degree, which is I want to study machine learning and apply it to health care/bioinformatics, specifically in human genome analysis (though admittedly, I have little biology knowledge, but a ton of excitement for the potential)

What else would you suggest I need to get in for the spring semester, or next fall?"

I'm really worried I've shot my chances at a good internship next summer so I'm trying to get a Fall one in industry. I have a summer government internship now but I'm worried it won't look as good to employers considering it's the same internship program as last semester.

The section says:

I was wondering whether it's a good idea to briefly address why my grades have dropped or if I should just let my GPA stand as is.

Transferring isn't an option since I'm financially strangled and will maybe have to work part-time in college (really hoping I don't need to).

I am almost done building an 8-bit computer that does basic calculations and was wondering if that would be better to show off as a portfolio project.

The people in this team are super smart and this is where I would want to be. But the thing is, a lot of the stuff they deal with scares the fuck out of me. I'm talking about a lot of debugging threads, race condition catching, parallel computing, CPU usage etc. I was randomly scrolling at the codebase once and I almost shit my pants when I saw a semaphore. Operating systems was my worst CS class but a part of me wants to stick it out so I can be here which is where I see myself.

The other part of me wants to move to some other team that does search, recommendations, ranking, machine learning etc since I'm a very theoretical and algorithmic person and those were my favorite courses in college. My project is going super well so far because the preliminary part is really theoretical but I'm afraid of when I'll get to the systems part.

**TLDR:** Should I pursue where I would want to see myself or what I like to do? Has anyone done one or the other and regretted his/her decision? I think I have the option of changing teams if I get a return offer but there's also the possibility that maybe the grass isn't greener on the other side."

Since most of my friends were busy with internships and/or summer programs I had nothing planned to do. My brother then decided to bring me along as well after I told him that I had nothing planned for the day.

My brother and I left first thing in the morning without getting any breakfast (this is already a fuck-up that will escalate later) and headed straight for the docks where he greeted his friends. I introduced myself to a couple of his friends that I haven't met yet. After few minutes of just saying what's up and random shit about their experiences of getting completely hammered at a club all of us got on a yacht. I brought a bottle of smirnoff vodka and passed it over to everyone to take a drink or two. We all got the party going as we cracked open few cans of Carlsburg and played Kings. All was going well and I was actually starting to get tipsy at this point. 

""Good."" I thought, ""I'm actually getting fucked up and this is actually pretty damn fun."" 

Then, out of nowhere one of my brother's friend brought over some Belvederes and made around 20 shots for everybody who was on the yacht. I forgot what were the ingredients but needless to say, after taking five of these shots I can tell that the drink hit me hard. Now I was just getting crunk and dancing to the music while having a little bit of trouble remaining my composure. I stumbled for a little bit as well. Prior experience of getting drunk made me realize that I got more confident and I was willing to do things I wouldn't normally do if sober. Being the dumb 16 year old kid I was, I actually decided to call out my brother's friend (they obviously had more experience than I did and they were not lightweights). For this story, we will call 
him G.

""Yo G! Let's have a shot together!"" I yelled, trying my best not to slur.

""Ahahahahaha... you're crazy bro!"" He said.

""G, don't be a pussy!"" I shouted.

Suddenly, the whole boat starting going wild. They couldn't believe that he was getting called out by a little punk ass kid who probably had no fucking clue what he was doing. G accepted the offer and we had about five shots together. I was having the time of my life and it was the most hammered I ever got up to that point. I began losing my balance consistently... but that didn't stop me yet! I still felt fine and I didn't think I was going to puke my brains out. I offered to drink one or two more shots with G. Consequently, I started to feel the urge to take a piss. I excused myself and stumbled all the way to the toilet. I still felt OK, but I was realizing that I was getting dizzy. I then proceeded to throw up into the toilet. 

I guess my brother must've realized that I had been gone for quite a bit of time that made him decide to check up on me and see how I was doing. He found me just passed the fuck out right on the toilet seat laying near my own vomit. He flipped the fuck out and told the captain to dock the boat so he could get me to a hospital. Turns out I had gotten alcohol poisoning when the doctor had to stick a tube down my throat to suction out my stomach to decrease chance of puking. 

In reality, I don't remember most of the events that transpired on that day. What I told you guys was what my brother had told me when I asked what the fuck happened. I sure learned my lesson which is to never overestimate yourself and to also learn how to control myself.

TL;DR I decided to act cool and call out people for being a pussy but I got my ass handed to me afterwards when I had to get my stomach pumped.

Rutgers obviously is a non target school that has gotten better over the years. But recently, especially with the creation honors college, makes the competition very very difficult even if you have the grades. You are competing for a limited number of opportunities, busting your butt networking and getting a high gpa, with no guarantee of an offer.

Realizing this, I was able to apply and secure admission to a well respected target school, where I will be heading in the fall. I highly suggest anyone trying to break into finance do the same. 

Again this isn't meant to say anything against RBS, it's just that I've seen juniors this year do everything from near perfect gpa, prior internships, and really good ec's, network their asses off, still not get offers and have to settle, unsure of their futures.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Female in engineering?


EDIT: Here's what I'm looking for in a school

- Public is fine :D, especially because it's affordable. That being said, I would get at least some financial aid from privates, so cost isn't too big of a hindrance

- As for environment, I don't want a school JUST known for partying. I would prefer a more academically-minded school with a strong engineering program.

- Location doesn't really matter, although my parents want me to stay in CA. I would go elsewhere if it's a really good opportunity though!"

6i2wvu,2,2017-06-18,How to advocate for myself at my part time job (20/m)?,drknockers69420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6i2wvu/how_to_advocate_for_myself_at_my_part_time_job_20m/,"So I work at this store that I've worked at since high school, only now I'm back from college for the summer and getting some hours in.  It's a pretty big grocery store and I've always just cashiered (which is fine), but this summer they have me in the back room in the grocery department stocking shelves and shit like that.  I hate it. 

I came back thinking I would have a straightforward summer job that I could do in my sleep with coworkers that I love and know, but that was completely turned upside down on me.  The guy who usually does grocery is at some internship for the summer, so I'm essentially taking over for him.  Long story short, the job makes me really stressed out, and does a number on my anxiety.  I don't really know anyone I'm working with anymore, and while they're perfectly fine people, I don't really fit in with them.  My hours are good but are really sporadic and unpredictable, changing day by day.  I don't know what I'm doing half the time, because I was never officially trained.  None of this fits well at all with my personality, and it's really taking a toll on me.

I've been exhausted, mentally and physically, I haven't been getting along with my parents, I've been distant from my friends and my girlfriend, and I've felt more and more depressed every time I go in.  The thing is, they do genuinely need my help in the grocery department, and I do genuinely want to help.  This is just too much for me though.  

I mentioned some of this to the manager that I used to work under as a cashier and who is technically the one giving me hours.  I told her that July is going to be crazy for me and that I would like to come back to being a cashier if it's possible.  She said she'd talk to the manager of the store itself, which is great.  I'm still stressed out about it though.

What do I do if things don't work out well?  I really don't want to come off as lazy or weak, but I don't know how much longer I can stand to work in the department I'm working in.  I can't just quit all together because I really need the money, and don't know how else to make money this summer, as another place probably wouldn't hire me for the eight or nine weeks I'll be here.  

Is there a productive way to go about this to ensure that I'm not throwing them under the bus, but am also taking my own mental health into account?  I've never been very assertive, and have trouble sticking up for myself in these situations, so this is way more difficult for me to handle than it should be."

I just graduated last week, and have been looking for jobs without much luck for the past few months. I have internship experience at a Canadian SAP office, but not much in the way of side projects. I think the biggest thing that is holding me back is the fact that my university if relatively unknown for CS. I'm open to almost any development positions, but have been mostly applying for frontend web development or backend Java positions.

I was wondering if anyone had some tips for how to find junior positions. So far, I've mostly been searching the big job boards (Indeed, Hired, etc) but this strategy hasn't been very successful. I've applied to over 100 jobs and have only received a few interviews for QA positions. Should I be sending cold emails to companies I'm interested in? Reaching out directly to recruiters I find on LinkedIn? Does Seattle have any institutions that support startups that I should be contacting? I'm still living in Canada right now, so I haven't been able to go to any Seattle meetups or career fairs.

I suspect that the fact that I'm not American might be scaring some companies as well. Canadians can get TN visas quite easily (and cheaply), so I don't think this should be a big issue. Any tips on how to address this? I have a small blurb on my resume explaining that I'm eligible for the TN visa."

I have had plenty of interviews, but I have been told point blank on more than one occasion that they are swamped with hundreds of applications for every position. 

At what point does this change? I have friends who graduated with me or December of last year who can't find jobs either.

Out of highschool I took a long break working full time at a factory.  I decided to move to another state, Michigan in the Detroit metro area and study automotives.  when i was about 2/4, 3/4 thru my schooling i decided to build a computer and get into video games.  It was amazing.  I found a group right away and started an arma dayz mod server.  I immediately took a role in our group as the server builder , messing with mods and database manipulation.  This caused me to change schooling and take a path in CS.  

Now, here is where everything goes a little ""OFF"".  I decided to just take the cert classes and save gen eds for later.  I took a couple gen eds along with cs courses but mainly still have about 5 gen eds left to take.  

Now here is where things go wild.  I had to move when i was 1 elective class ""system's security"" away from getting a certificate in software engineering from my college.  I finally found a class at a local college that will cover the requirement so i can get certified but the class is only offered in fall of 2017.  I moved away a little after January of 2017.   

So now i live in the Chicago land area and have been trying to find an internship locally or entry level position that will allow me to work but i seem to be just turned away left and right because i cannot officially say i am Certified in software engineering.  

I have great grades. accumulative 3.249 over 80 credit hours.

I am working on a game with friend but we have big ambitions and creating all assets on our own through blender and unity so i don't expect anything from that for YEARS.  

So, here is my question to you guys.  Am i sending out Resumes too early?  Are they expecting to atleast see a full cert from a college or do they expect an associates degree.  Should i full time school for a while and finish the Associates or will the Cert be fine?

I am losing ambition and feeling wayyyy in the dumps.  All my friends from michigan school found jobs RIGHT away, while i am sitting here on Indeed, ziprecruiter, monster, glassdoor seeing ""your resume was viewed 3 times"" repeatedly just to never hear ANYTHING back.  

If you think its my Resume i can send a copy.

I'm an intern in our Helpdesk/Sys Administration and one of my tasks is to set up our new and old notebooks when we receive them from our vendor or when they are returned by our employees.

I wouldn't mind doing this by hand if it was like a notebook a week or something, but we do have quite a lot of them that need to be set up appropriately. Not only Windows needs a clean install but also all the tools we use in the company (e.g. Outlook). This means that I need a way to create and handle several slightly different images...

Our company doesn't have a WDS yet and with my limited experience I didn't quite manage to create a proof of concept that works and that I could present to my manager.

I'm still not sure how Microsoft handles the Windows 10 Licenses. 
We currently have 4 different notebooks in use. The hardware is very similiar though, it's just different versions of the same model.

How do you guys handle the set up of different machines? Are you working with scripts? WDS? 3rd party software?

Do you have any easy-to-understand guides that would help me understand WDS better?

Thanks a lot!"

6i5yvt,1,2017-06-19,Driving Anxiety &amp; Work,xo_Derpasaur_ox,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6i5yvt/driving_anxiety_work/,"I apologize ahead of time, as I know I'm long-winded. 

I have an internship at an engineering company that I started in August. I was able to get a foot in the door because my husband had been working an internship there as well for a little bit when they started looking for more interns to bring on. From the get go, I figured things would be a bit of on obstacle. It's a small firm, run by a man and his son, with barely 15-20 employees across all positions. During my interview, there were already hints of sexism that foreshadowed the continuation of it going forward, but it was relatively expected to a degree considering I'm a female in a male dominated field. Given, I had expected this more from the field workers than the bosses, but that's a different story.

Anywho, I have terrible anxiety that I feel I hide pretty well when out in public. My doctor tried prescribing things like Xanax, but I also get really bad anxiety when taking medications (even as trivial as Advil and other pain relievers) and ultimately decided to try to work it out as best as I could. I can't afford many doctor visits, so I  probably got minimal help with my anxiety as a whole. While I'm able to get myself through or cope with a good portion of my anxiety when in public, one thing that I can't escape is my intense anxiety towards driving. 

I believe it all stems from having a super shitty car that didn't brake well and couldn't accelerate competently, combined with moving from one lane each way backcountry roads to super busy 3-lane city roads with terrible drivers. I started driving minimally, and once I moved in with my now-husband, stopped driving unless out of complete necessity. This hasn't posed too much of a problem since my husband and I attend the same college and then worked at the same place. But now, my company is getting antsy about my inability to drive. It never got brought up, as it never posed a problem. But the past few week, the boss's son has wanted me to essentially run errands for them, such as dropping off/ picking up a work truck to a mechanic. I politely noted that I didn't feel comfortable driving the company vehicles, had my husband help out with a few of the tasks, and try to stay under the radar when they try to send someone to go run an errand. Our office lady / HR person told me today that they had mentioned it to her in passing and that they were starting to make a problem out of it, and cautioned me to try to resolve it. So now I'm freaking the fuck out trying to figure out what to do. 

It doesn't help that most of the company vehicles are shit. Some shake between certain speeds, others don't even have a working driver seatbelt, etc. These definitely don't help when it was likely a shitty car that helped contribute heavily to my anxiety. I'm worried about losing my job, and I can't afford to have that happen. But at the same time, I'm frustrated, angry, and scared all at once. At my current position, my job description does not/ should not require me to be able to drive on-job, outside of them wanting favors done, so I do have that on my side if they were to address this to me. However, i know damn well that I will need to be able to drive moving forward in my career. 

I have no idea what to do. My crappy car finally took a shitter, so this is my opportunity to get a better vehicle to become more comfortable with driving. But I'm not sure when that will happen due to finances, etc, so until then, I'm screwed when it comes to even trying to get back behind the wheel. I'm terrified of losing my job, but I'm almost just as terrified to drive. How the hell do I go about trying to resolve my own problems, while not losing my job in the mean time?

TLDR: Really bad anxiety/driving anxiety, can't drive. While my job description doesnt/shouldn't require me to drive, bosses now getting antsy after figuring out I can't/won't drive company vehicles after trying to have me be an errand jockey.  "

I am Computer Science student (I live in Poland), I am on my third year (out of 5 for master's degree) and working on my thesis (something equivalent to Bachelor Thesis in USA? I'm not sure), my subject is cool, it involves Apache Spark and particle physics. I am also part-time Scala Developer (1 year exp now), full-time during summer.
    
A while ago I've started to become more ambitious and I'm studying a lot in my free time. Currently I'm tackling Java Concurrency in Practice and Functional Programming in Scala (very challenging book for me). Doing that + reading random articles/papers and watching conferences' videos + college assignments + my thesis take all of my limited free time (I have like 3-4 hours in weekdays and 1 spare day on weekend) and I feel like I might have to slow down a bit to prevent burning out too quickly.
    
The problem is I'm seriously considering applying to some bigger companies in EU/USA for Summer 2018 Internships, mainly to practice interview process and have a better shot in 2019 if I fail. So I would have to spend few months exercising algorithms and get very comfortable with programming language other than Scala (most likely Java or Python).
    
As you can see, there are way too many things at once and I need to somehow set my priorities right and just learn one thing at a time but there are some deadlines regarding those internships unless I could just hold those plans for now (I still have a job and I'm improving as a software developer every day) and just try after graduation but I don't really think about permanently moving out of my country so I'd prefer summer internship and I'm worried the next two years are my last chance for experience like this.

Do you have any advice?

I am an international student going to 11th grade this year. I am aiming for the top colleges that also offer financial aid as my parent's income is only around 25,000$ a year and maybe next year, even that might drop to 10k.

Intended major - CS

SAT - 1550 (800M,750R&amp;W)

GPA - 9.8/10 (9th and 10th grade) so around 3.9/4

Location - Bangalore, India

ECs - Very subpar apart from my Online Courses (or MOOCs)

* Indian Music - 5 yrs (No concerts and shit,just learning)
* Volunteering at an NGO - 50 hours till now
* An unpaid internship at a company related to CS from May 2017 till probably Dec 2019
* Helping in School Science Fairs and Project Days 
* Probably will be a part of a Media Club at my school ( One of the only 3 clubs that actually does something at the school)
* Starting a new Rotary Club at my school
* I am planning on staying back after school and helping my teachers starting this year
* Speed cubing (Solving rubik's cubes)  - Dunno if this would be included as it was 2-3 years ago and I wasn't all that great (25 sec avg.)
* And now, the main thing I have been focused on for the past year -- MOOCs

I started a python course from MIT around 10 months ago and I fell in love with it. Since then, I have taken over 10 'college-level' courses along with a few Masters Courses (on edx and Coursera) and I have gotten around 6 verified certificates .I've spent many hundreds of hours on them ( even  14 hours a week for around 7 weeks for one of those courses).Most are CS and AI courses along with 2-3 math courses.I plan on taking around 7-10 more courses and I also plan on getting a Udacity MLEND(Machine Learning Engineer Nano-degree)the next year.

The thing is, I **LOVE** learning.  I'm having so much fun taking these courses but at the same time, I really want to get into the top unis. If these courses aren't gonna be helpful at all, I'd probably focus more on a different thing. I really wanna know if colleges even care about these things and if they appreciate it at all.After all, my dream ,since 2008, has always been to go back to the US. I would kill to even get into atleast one of the top schools. I would greatly appreciate any help! 

I still got a year and a quarter before applications start so if I need to pivot and change things up, please let me know. Also, I would love any ideas for volunteering/building up my ECs as my ideas are either really dumb or they keep getting rejected due to factors out of my control.

I want to transition to backend but it seems a bit difficult because there are too many backend developers where I'm at. I feel like my career is stagnating or will stagnate if I stay here. But I'm afraid I won't get hired anywhere because of my short 1.5 year stints.

Not sure what to do. Stay another year and build up my skills at home or find another job ASAP?"

I am one year removed from graduating from a state university with a major in Marketing and a minor in Computer science. Internship experience during school focused mainly on IT with some marketing mixed in.

Currently, I am in a sales role at a marketing technology company in Boston. I make good money for what I do ($50k base), but it's not enough to make up for the dread I experience every morning waking up to go to work. This is going to be a bit of a vent session, so bear with me, lol:

I love the company I'm with. Everyone I work with is intelligent and helpful and the product we make, although nearly impossible to sell, is interesting and useful.

That being said, I fucking hate sales, so, so, much. I can't stand how mind numbing prospecting is. I can't stand how even if I'm so very fortunate to get on someone's calendar, I'm always just the ""sales guy"". My time is never valued externally. Our sales cycle is 6-12 months. This creates an environment with very little gratification and constant head-banging.

I am a person who likes to create, I like to DO things. I like to be busy. This may be pompous but I genuinely believe I'm too skilled and smart to be drafting 50 emails a day to people who couldn't be bothered to read them. Or reciting the same damn sales pitch every time I do get a meeting.

When I want to get something tangible done, like when I'm modifying my car, or writing an essay, or even just cleaning my house, I work with passion and typically have and end result I can look at and be proud of. I can't stand coming into work, sending a myriad of emails, maybe taking a meeting or two, and having nothing to show for it.

I feel my brain isn't being worked and I'm not learning new things, so I've been looking into moving on. While the idea of moving on excites me greatly, I have found it more difficult than expected to answer the question of ""so you've just worked a job you hate for a year, what would be a job that you would LIKE?"".

This paragraph should be where I go into a bit about myself: I'm a tinkerer, a creator, a builder. I like to get dirty and do the irregular and solve problems. I wanted to be an engineer but was never good enough at the math. Then I wanted to be a computer scientist but programming just didn't come naturally to me. I fell into marketing and came to genuinely enjoy analyzing and solving business problems.

When I graduated, a marketing position seemed natural. But in Boston with a state school degree in town of Harvard, MIT, and the like, I found it near-impossible to land a decent entry-level marketing/advertising gig, so I settled for sales.

I've learned valuable things about marketing technology, but the field, and sales, are something I could never be passionate about. I enjoy, and am good at, talking to people, but I just don't solve problems like I did in school. My brain feels like it's turning to mush.

I've looked at business analyst roles, although those are very competitive. The same can be said about the marketing coordinator roles I've applied for. I hold out hope but need other options. I am passionate about renewable energy, the outdoors, sports, anything with an engine, writing, and fixing things. I'm hoping you were a saint enough to read down to here and give me some advice on some roles I should be on the lookout for that will allow me to have a more gratifying and impactful career, all while managing to still pay my rent every month.

Boston is booming right now, and I'm hopeful because the opportunities are boundless. But that is both a blessing and an overwhelming curse. Do you have any recommendations for things I should be typing in that LinkedIn/Indeed search bar?"

I am making very slow progress as a result, since I don't really know what I'm doing.

My strategy so far has been to try to imitate existing code, but the codebase doesn't always lend itself to that.

I've considered leaving the project aside for a little while, to focus on learning the foundations of web development and the frameworks I'm working with.
However, I'm worried this will not leave me enough time to work on the actual project (I have a month and a half left in my internship).

I did mention to my manager that I thought I would be more productive if I worked on something slightly closer to my comfort zone, but she seemed confident that I would figure things out.

I am currently a 20 year old attending university studying business management and I currently feel hopeless. I feel like ever since I started university, the optimistic light in my eyes has been crushed by reality and its expectations. Although I’m doing well in terms of GPA, I feel as if my professional and social growth have been stinted. My daily routine now consists of mindlessly attending classes while completing the accompanying work. As of now, I fail to see the meaning behind my efforts put into classes that produce no meaningful skills. To make matters worse, my attempts at landing a paid summer internship have borne no fruit. My current summer plan is to attend an internship abroad that is hosted through one of my university’s programs. While this fills my time off with work, it does not offer any pay nor prestige. Facing the reality of my mediocrity has been an insightful journey, but it has led to the further development of my self-conscious behavior. 

My self-esteem has hit an all-time low. Whenever I attend extracurricular clubs and attempt to socialize, my personality takes on a very superficial persona, one that is very easily noticed. At times my mind goes blank while conversing, leading to awkward stuttering and conversations that lack depth. This result has led to many acquaintances but no true friendships. Now, I feel as if I have no one to fall back to. Due to sour relations with my brother in law, he talks poorly behind my back with my family concerning my achievements and future. Sadly, I have no retaliation to these statements because sometimes, I too feel as if my future is bleak. I’ve entered a cycle of depression where I scorn myself for having no friends, failing to make new friends through clubs, and then scorning myself more so for my lack of social skills. At this point I don’t know what it takes to break this cycle of unhappiness. I’ve talked to therapists provided by my school, but I feel as if their help is superficial as they have many patients and rely on unrealistic positivity. 

When I return home for the summer, my professionally successful sister enjoys gloating of her success while passive aggressively putting me down. I have heard her multiple times talking negatively about to her fiancé, my family, and her friends. I try to not let this get to me but the continued coexistence between us at our parents’ home makes total separation difficult. At this point I feel as if I have nothing to be proud of while disappointing my parents. 

If matter continues as they are now, I fear I will become socially incompetent and become a permanent shut in. My current efforts have yielded poor results so I would appreciate any advice that would help me get back to a fulfilling lifestyle.

Thank you so much for your time.

I'm a second year graduate student in Electrical Engineering from a top 20 grad school in VLSI and mixed signal design. My coursework includes VLSI design, Analog integrated circuits, ADC/DAC, microprocessor design and device physics. 

In less than one year from now, I'd have to look for full time opportunities and unfortunately, I couldn't secure an internship during this summer. As a budding musician, I have spent a great deal of time in learning and designing my own guitar pedals which  helped me gain a strong foothold in the analog circuit domain / fundamentals of signal processing. Is this skill marketable to companies such as TI, NXP , Intel or Qualcomm? 

I've been told by many friends and other sources that it is really hard to get a full time job in analog engineering without prior work experience ( which I lack). Is this true? Or should I stick with the more conventional digital design jobs such as physical design, design verification?

Any help in this matter is much appreciated.

The Institute i will do the Apprenticeship in is Microsoft Certified and will mostly focus on C#/.net and Javascript/HTML as far as i know. 

The Question is: what would be the best source now to focus on? I really like to just focus on one source of learning for the next 6 Weeks, since i did too many stuff for now and it gets over my head, literally blocking my progress i think.

So what is the best source for now to focus on learning for the next weeks? Any advice and recommendations would be highly appreciated :)"

6ibeg7,6,2017-06-19,This is not the life I want,IlParnassoConfuso,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6ibeg7/this_is_not_the_life_i_want/,"I'm a closeted transgender woman and I can't accept it. There's too much wrong with me for me to list it, there's not enough hormones and surgeries in the world that will be able to make me look like a woman, I don't think it's worth it to try it and set myself up for disappointment.

I haven't done anything since I graduated from college about 5 months ago. I just can't bring myself to look for jobs, the idea of updating my portfolio makes me sick to my stomach. It doesn't help that I suck at the field I graduated, I have zero confidence on my skills and my only experience is an internship that lasted for a little over a year.

I'm so tired of putting so much work into my appearance only to realize I'm still painfully ugly. My skin is bad, it's uneven, I have rosacea on my cheeks/jaw and I have some permanent farmer's tan even though I wash my face daily with two different and expensive skin cleansers and micellar water and I've been using expensive sunscreens daily for the past 5 years.My hair is awful. After one asshole uncle suggested we had a buzzcut at 5 or so it was never the same. It's incredibly dry, there's a lot of fly aways and frizz. 

Then there's the things that are harder to change. My posture is awful, I'm in tears now after I saw a picture of myself that shows how fucked up my neck and hunchback looks. My teeth are awful, and after almost 10 years of a failed treatment I'll have to start a new one, wear braces all over again and possibly went through surgery for my jaw. My face is completely asymmetrical, its even more pronounced in photos. I'm balding and my once small and rounded forehead is now huge and square. 

And then there's the transgender part of it. My body is very masculine, with broad shoulders, big hands and feet,etc. My neck used to appear longer, but ever since I gained weight (I'm working on it, I have lost 8 pounds recently) and as my posture became worst it basically vanished. In short my body is anything but feminine, and I don't see any amount of hormones fixing it. 

I can't stand to shave my face every fucking day, and still never having a completely shaved look. No matter how much I shave you can always see a lot of hairs, and the beard shadow doesnt help. Why do I even try?

And then there's the other types of issues. I have weird tremors in my hands and face. I have migraines, visual snow,etc. 

I don't think my parents will ever accept me as trans. It would be just my luck that I happen to live in the country with the biggest numbers of murders of trans people. I already feel threatened now that I'm closeted, I just can't imagine feeling save after I come out. 

I have no life since high school. Since then I would just go to school (and later college) and then back home. I don't go out, I don't have any friends, I never did things normal teenagers do and now at 21 I feel like I have missed out on a normal life. And it feels too late to fix it, how many years will it take for hormones, surgeries,etc to make a real difference? What about my teeth, that's easily more 5 years ""under construction"". For what? so I'll be in my 30s and with the life experience and emotional intelligence of a teenager? So I can look like myself in drag while I attempt to be a woman? So I can be shamed at home and in the streets? 

I just want to be normal so bad. I get blind with rage when I see perfectly normal, conventional looking cisgender people mentioning not being normal, like that  Sigourney Weaver post on the front page, where her yearbook quote is something about not wanting to be normal. Of course it's cool to be ""differente"" and ""not normal"" when you're basically are normal. I'm not normal, I'm different, and it's not cool at all. 

I think I'll only get worst when I start working again. My parents are impatient that I start looking for jobs soon, since they don't want me to ""loose the entire year"". The only comfort I have is that I can stay at home and not having to face the real world. 

I don't have the guts to kill myself, but I'm so tired of being like this. All I can do is daydream of a live where I'm cisgender and just like all the other women. Where I'm beautiful, feminine and happy. Where I'm smart and talented, get married, have children,etc. Everything that can't happen in reality. "

For the student teaching position, my university would place me at a school.  I would be working with experienced teachers for 16 weeks and it is unpaid. I like this option because I have a little bit of  classroom management skills but I like that there will be another teacher with me. 


For the internship, I would have to apply to schools as a student who is still working on obtaining a credential and compete with teachers who are already credentialed. Hopefully, there is a high need for math teachers in California, Sacramento area.  If I do get an internship, it would be a full-time paid position.  I would get my own classroom but still have the support of a mentor teacher, principles and other staff members.  However, my classroom management skills are limited and I am a little worried about being on my own with the students.  But it does seem like a good learning experience. 


Which of the two would you recommend?

I've decided that I would like to pursue an education in IT followed by a career in its field. I'm currently a U.S. Army reservist in ait for an IT- related MOS. ( we'll just say I'm a 25B since my last post had a misunderstanding ).

So I don't have much experience at all, just basics I've learned like setting up a windows server domain, utilizing active directory, setting up a Redhat IPA server using ldap, Cisco router configuration and subnetting. I know a little Bash and java. So there's that. I've also signed up to take the compTIA sec+ and net+ in 2 months. I've been watching Professor Messer, reviewing flashcards, and reading my Security+ book to prepare. 

I was wondering what else I should to to further my knowledge. I'm really interested in IT security. I start community college in January 2018 and will probably get my associates in Information systems that same year. I'm guessing getting a degree in a related field would help as well. The 2 universities near me both offer degrees in Information Systems and computer science.  I'm not really sure which one would benefit me more. 

I'm not really sure where to start for work experience though. Being an intern for a systems admin? I've downloaded the OWASP webgoat project to learn security and penetration concepts. 

So yeah, I'm not really where to start my career into IT at. There seems so much to learn but I actually find it interesting.

I know I have plenty of opportunity to work my way up in the company as the current lead software engineers are nearing retirement age.  They have explicitly stated that they hope I stick around so I can work my way up to leadership positions in the future which I can see myself doing.  My question is though, is this a solid plan?

-Previous internships in Sales and Product Marketing with other top IT companies
    
    Things I have considered:
    
-Continue to develop with Ps and Ai for freelance possibilities. Take UI/UX design bootcamp?

-Continue to develop Js or SQL experience with a part-time coding bootcamp or online course. Can also utilize data science team at current company for SQL advice

-Study and take the GRE or GMAT for some version of grad school or business school, but I don't think this is a wise investment yet if I don't know what I want to get out of it


**Tl;DR:** 25, goal-driven, ambitious, but not sure what to do to set me up for success. Paths include Account Management, Data Science, UI/UX Design, Js Developer, Project Manager, Product Manager, but maybe more?

Any advice? And what are some actionable steps I can take to get there?"

I have no idea what I am going to do. It is really bothering me and I cannot sleep at night thinking about it.

What can I do?
Are there any certifications I can do in my current summer break which can help me get a good internship next spring?"

I am trying to complete the financial part of our idea to present in one of the big consulting company's competition. I had completed everything cash flow, pricing strategy, business model, worst-expected-good case and was almost done with Monte-Carlo until our coach, a consultant from the firm that is organizing the competition, said that she did not like it and it was too analytical and did not speak to any strong feelings telling me to show how lucrative the business will be.

My other teammates also scrapped the idea after our meeting and changed everything and now I have a whole new model in my hand, I don't know how to speak to people's feelings through financial estimates and have a whole bunch of analysis in my hand that I put in a lot of work into. 

I have 3 days to complete everything and I'm doing an internship at the same time so I have very limited time.

Are there any examples of models or slides I can reconstruct fit my case that will make it look more emotional? Or should I just stick with what I have and make the slides more cheerful?

in terms of experience i'm currently working my 3rd IT internship this summer, with it being at a pretty well known company. despite this, i didn't really do much development at any of my 3 internships, including the one i started this summer. on top of that, i'm also very involved with school activities and clubs, so overall my resume looks pretty good. i don't necessarily know yet if i just want to do straight up development, but i like working in the CS field doing related things too.

 i'm just really worried about how to go about finding a job with such a low gpa, and  i also really want to move out of my state and into a city like chicago or new york. is this unrealistic? what can i do before i graduate to increase my chances of getting a decent job or is it too late?

Also here are my [unofficial transcripts as proof](http://imgur.com/a/y8OdJ)

Be me, 21, first semester computer science at Arizona State University. I barely graduated high school with a 1.7 gpa, so being on the campus was a big deal to me. Also, I had already spent two years of doing prereqs just to be get to freshmen level classes at ASU. So, school work is hard but I get through my first semester with ok grades. Failed precalc but then I placed into calculus the next semester by taking the placement exam which I didnt know I could do before.

Ok second semester now, things got tough, really tough. I failed my first chem exam of the semester and that started what would be my worst semester of college. After that exam I couldnt care about school, so, instead I focused my energy on partying, big mistake. I failed every class that semester and it dropped my gpa to a 1.84. I was put on academic probation and was told I would be expelled if my grades didnt improve dramatically the following semester. So, I buckled down and tried what I thought was my hardest. I studied my ass off and never gave up because I knew that if I didnt pass this semester I was fucked. Unfortunately that wasnt enough and I was expelled **ONE YEAR** into the best thing I had ever accomplished. What the fuck was I going to do. The same thing both of my parents had done their entire lives, keep working. As much as I didnt want to at the time I knew that I had to mimic my parents and just keep going. So I did just that. 

So spring 2013 I went to community college, continued taking classes in order to reapply for readmittance into the university. Mind you this entire time I had to lie not only to myself but to everyone that asked 'hey hows ASU going?' It is one of the biggest shames that I have. I didnt think about that though, I knew I had something that I wanted and needed to finish. So im in community college and I continue to fail classes like calc 3, discrete math, intro to programming languages, digital design and I began to think do I really want this and can I really do this? Thankfully my mom, who thought I was still failing classes at ASU, and my best friend were always there to cheer me on when I needed it most. So after three years of community college I felt that I had done enough to reapply. So I reapplied and after a while I learned that I had been accepted back into the university but not into the degree program I was in before (computer science). I was now......a software engineer?????? WTF, this was not what I wanted at all. I remember telling one of my friends this and he joked that the 'software engineering degree is like a poor mans computer science degree.' I laughed it off but that joke still cuts me to this day. I am a poor mans computer science degree. 

Anyway I get back into ASU and bitch the entire time im there because I hated being a software engineer and not a computer science major, I was again ashamed of myself, but I had shake that off because as a first generation I had the weight of my entire family riding on me finishing college and being the first to get to university I knew I had to friggin do it. So I buckled down, and was doing great! I was passing classes and felt really good for myself. It was my first semester back and I knew I had a lot that I needed to prove. At the time I was working at a prominent bar here in the valley and was making good money. I figured that I could still be out and social while not drinking if I worked at a bar. This worked well. I stopped drinking and was really focused on my academics. So spring training rolls around and my friend comes into town and I show her around. We have a few drinks and decide its time to go home. I thought I was cool to drive but of course I wasnt. BAM! DUI! Fucking aye, here we go again you dunderfucking pipi caca face. What the fuck am I going to do now? How am I going to tell my mom, what is going to happen to my career potential? A million questions were roaring through my head as I spent the night in jail. Looking back on it now, I appreciate this happening to me because it completely changed my life for the better but at the time, I was at one of the lowest points I had ever been. Even counting the time I was kicked out of ASU. Thankfully something inside me just burned and said not this time so I got through the semester.

After that semester I literally went cold turkey from drinking and partying and anything that didnt pay me academically or monetarily up until the day I graduated but well get to that soon.

So fast forward to Fall 2015. I decided to live on campus so that I can really immerse myself and focus on finishing. Its november now and I hadnt received any call backs from the internship applications that I had sent out. I mean realistically who tf would hire me. Got kicked out of uni and a DUI. No freakin way, but, as always, my persistence paid off. I had met a manager from a really big company at the career fair a few months back and he said he didnt have any more positions but to keep contact just in case so I did just that. I bugged and bugged and bugged and eventually that November, he said a spot had opened up and if I wanted to interview. I immediately jumped at the chance and hit the books. Not even a few days later I got a call from another company asking if id like to interview. Hell yea I did! So I interview with both and what do you know I got both of them to offer me positions. I took both as I made one a six month internship and the other a three month. I was in! FINALLY.

So there I was entering my final semester of college. Spring 2017. I had previously signed my offer letter at my internship so all I had to do now was graduate! As much pain and suffering I had to go through throughout the semester I did it and it was now the week of finals and im stressing the fuck out because I had finals and graduation party plans to finalize and hw and just a bunch of shit. So as if I didnt have enough that week, I get a phone call from the CDC saying that the blood that they drew the week before came up positive for TB. Fuck me man. Literally the last thing I ever wanted. Little did I know but that phone call would drastically shape the way my life would go for the next two months. I could not believe it. It turned out that we had a TB scare at school and thats why I got tested and I came up with it like wtf! I am going to school to gain knowledge not to get sick! So after the dust of graduating had settled I had to sit and think is everything ok, am I ok? Physically? Mentally? It was a very scary moment for me and it continues to be. The entire time since graduation ive been traveling and it has been a constant reminder that no matter how far you try and run you cant escape the thoughts in your head. 

Now this isnt like a good bye im not dying. Im not contagious and im on medication to kill the lingering bacteria, thankfully. Its just a reminder that no matter how amazing things are or how shit they may be at any moment of time in your life, you just gotta keep going, and that no matter how well someone may look on the outside, you may never really know how well they are doing on the inside. 

Looking back I can definitely pinpoint some times where I knew I was going through some shit that I was not mentally prepared for. There were times were I would break down and cry because I thought I cant do this its too fucking hard! There were times when I felt the entirety of pressure that my family was putting on me to be the first to finish college and graduate and it was a lot to handle mentally. I remember that during one of these times there was actually a time a girl jumped off one of the engineering buildings here at ASU and killed herself and I swore I knew what she was feeling and what she was going through. It was like looking in the mirror. I could have easily been her, but I wasnt. I honestly dont know where I would be or what id be doing if it wasnt for my best friend and mom and their encouraging words. So with that being said if you yourself dont think you can do it, **I am living fucking proof that even and idiot can get this shit done.**

 Also that if you are going through things youre not alone. Talk to someone. Dont bottle it up. Seek out counseling services on campus to get help because yea this shits hard and its harder to do it alone. Fuck stigmas of going to counseling they are actually really nice people who just want to help. Also orgs are fucking amazing. I unluckily joined one my senior year and I say unluckily because in just one year theyve become some of my best friends and I wish I would have gone sooner! If youre curious as to which org it is, its called SHPE and literally every chapeter ive met has been super welcoming even if youre not hispanic or an engineer. [Here we are on grad day!](http://imgur.com/a/BiGDF) Im starting to ramble now so im done. That was my road to being an engineer."

**BACKGROUND**

**Work experience:**
* Current Role: 2.5 years working in market strategy and operations at a unicorn (think Uber/AirBnB) with a big data/analytics focus (SQL, heavy spreadsheet modeling, etc). Have received two promotions (one title change), and am directly managing a team of 3 people. The role involves making very high impact decisions for our market, and we’re given the freedom and autonomy to fully strategize and own these decisions.
* Previous Roles: 3 years at an economic consulting firm doing business valuation and damages modeling. Received one promotion during my time there. Also had a year-long college internship at a large bank doing private wealth management.

**Extra curriculars:**
* Co-captain a USTA tennis team in the city in which I live. We play competitive mixed doubles and have made our league playoffs twice in the last 3 years
* Currently volunteering with an inner-city tennis league teaching underprivileged children living in low-income housing projects, as well as assisting with program strategy through data analysis and insights
* Spent two summers coaching tennis with the Special Olympics, specifically teaching children with intellectual disabilities
* Organized annual office tennis events at my last company for three years. Also helped organize the office ping pong tournament for the past 2 years at my current company.
* Currently run SQL classes at my company to teach all new-hires as well as anyone else who wants to learn SQL in the office
* Heavily involved in interviewing at my current company
* Academic chair in my college fraternity. Went beyond the standard “improve people’s GPA’s” and organized professional networking events to help fraternity members with internship opportunities
* Love to learn about the world through travel (have traveled to 16 countries)

**Undergrad school/major:** Top 40 university, BA in Economics w/ minor in Math

**Race/nationality:** Asian-American

**Sex:** Male

**STATS**

**GMAT Score (include breakdown!):** 760 (Q49, V46, 8 IR, 5 AWA)

**Undergrad GPA:** 3.63/4.00

**MBA INFO**

**Goal of MBA:** I’m looking to gain the management and leadership skills to complement my technical skills and lead a strategy &amp; analytics team or move into product management at large tech company (think Google/FB/Amazon). While I am already a manager leading an analytical team at my current company, I’m looking to move to a larger, more established firm and acquire the softer skills to become a stronger leader.

**Target schools:** 
* R1: Harvard, Standford, Wharton, Columbia, MIT Sloan
* R2: Booth, Kellogg, Haas

I know I'm aiming high here, but I do feel that I have a compelling M7 profile (obviously, check me if I'm wrong there). I know they are a crapshoot, but I'm more curious about my chances at H/S/W. I'm concerned about my solid but not super impressive undergrad school, and pretty average GPA as far as these programs are concerned.

Thank you in advance!"

Will I be able to find an internship by next summer without having those classes under my belt? I have learned about arrays, linked list, binary search trees, stacks, and basic searching and sorting algorithms in my C++ class. I just don't know any of the theory behind them like Big O notation and proofs. Cracking the coding interview and leetcode still look really alien to me.

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Biology, and I feel as if that is the biggest mistake I have made for myself. When I started college I was eager to succeed and become a dentist. I never thought about doing anything else besides that, but as my grades plummeted I realized that the path I envisioned just wasn't going to happen. I struggled through my tough science classes and it felt like a drag and it even took me an extra year to complete my bachelors but I finally got the degree that holds zero value for me. Every time I sit and try to come up with a plan on what to do next I feel as if a heavy rock has been placed on me. But the clock is ticking and it doesn't stop for anyone, so I do need to figure out what my next step is on this road to success. So far I have thought about doing nursing, I never wanted to do that but with my background in science and poor GPA it seems to be a valid option. My second thought was completely changing my field of education and trying for the IT field. But for that I have no idea where to beginning from. I know Data Science is a huge growing field right now and they earn well also. But how do I figure out that that is the career path for me? I am afraid to make the wrong choice and regret it later or waste my time. I know, I know, that is life and I cannot be afraid of it if I want to go somewhere. I need to stop thinking the ""buts"" the ""what ifs"" and go for something already, as of right now I'm wasting time regardless. Honestly, I just want to make a lot of money with a slightly easier path than becoming a doctor of some sort. Just look at the Kardasians, living in millions for doing what? I always thought about becoming a Youtuber, I am a creative person, I want to be famous, who doesn't? Or be one of those Instagram models? Why not? It all seems nice to think about but not practical for the future, or I just don't have the courage in me.
What my nursing friends tell me- they started making 93K and only have to work 13 shifts a month- that's like working 150 days out of 356 days. Sounds nice but why hasn't this pushed me to do that then. Going for the corporate world means working a 9-5pm job M-F. I ask myself do I want to wear scrubs for the rest of my life or business wear, nice pencils skirts? And I honestly don't know the answer to any of these questions. Can I get a trial and error at this life. There are an endless amount possibilities I can choose from yet I can't pick any.
The nurses out there, please tell me the pros and cons about what you do. And if this was the route I chose what would my next step be? Should I go for an associates first since my GPA is so low and then do a bridge programs? Is getting a second bachelors degree worth what you guys do?
Anyone in the IT field, (data scientists, QAs, anyone) how do I enter this field with a biology background? Should I find some internship? I looked into those data science boot camps but they seem pricey for something I'm unsure of. Any insight on what your job entails of would help.
Redditters please help me clear up the clutter in my mind, let me know what you would do in my place.

When I was in art school in Chicago for game design, I took a job as a Jimmy John's delivery driver to pay my way.  The school I was going to charged an immense amount of money and as the years went by I eventually had to leave the program because I couldn't outright afford it.   In truth I was also starting to see how much artists were paid in the industry starting off and considering the amount of my student loan, I felt scared.  I also watched friends of mine graduate and have to move from job to job every few months which was disturbing to me as well.  I was in love with my now wife at the time and couldn't logically think of a way to keep affording to move her as well as me from job to job.  

I was offered a management position at the store I worked at about a year from graduating. The position starting off was paying quite well and there was room to grow if I was a hard worker.  I am a hard worker, I was asked to move to another state and run a store.   I made Regional manager within two years of working at my company and now oversee all the stores in our state owned by our company.  

Recently my company has severely taken advantage of my loyalty and hard work.  My director of operations started an inappropriate relationship with my sister after I made it very clear I was not comfortable with it (My sister is a recovering drug addict who is not stable but very very beautiful. She is also Bi-Polar, this causes problems)  He brought her to a work function (I asked him not to bring her)where I won an award for being the best run store out of a chain of 30.  He fed her alcohol at the function.  She got drunk and threatened to murder my HR rep for touching my boss on the shoulder.   It was really embarrassing.  Their relationship ended in violence six months later and I have been outcast-ed at my company ever since.  At the last Christmas party my HR rep bought gifts for all the area managers and made a show of giving them all in front of all our employees (Area mangers oversee General mangers who were all present.) I wasn't given anything in fact I was pretty much ignored for the event.    

I work for salary and there are weeks that go by where I don't get a day off.   I run three of the thirty stores in our chain, the remaining stores in our company are an entire state away from me.  I repeatedly report to my Director of Operations that I need help running stores that are loosing staff to competitors paying more up the street.  No help is given, no strategy is formed, I'm always told to cover the peoples shifts that are leaving until a replacement can be found.   I am over worked and I hate being responsible for all these fast food stores on this level, I just finished a 70 hour work week and I was not compensated any extra for it than what I would have been paid to work my normal 45 hour work week.   Not even a thanks.  

I feel trapped.  While the money is good enough where I can support my wife if needed and I'm able to make payments on my crushing student loan.   My job sucks the life out of me, I manage a staff of 50+ employees who work mostly for minimum wage with absolute shit attitudes and I have the worlds most uncomfortable relationship with my boss.  It makes my job a living nightmare, yet I'm still grinding it out every day because I'm afraid.

I watched ""The internship"" the other night and just about broke down in tears when they walked into a creative work environment for the first time.   In two days I turn 35, I feel like I wasted my early working career on the wrong company and now I don't really know where to begin."

I have taken tons of CS courses, many of which have been algorithms, time complexities, and tons of low level programming in C in OS, and have had 2 internships in Software Engineering/Development, but I really want to get an internship in Hardware/Signal Processing next summer. Also, I shouldn't say I have no hardware classes because I have a few like circuit analysis, an intro course on signals, and a class on transistors. I have used Matlab and am becoming more and more familiar with it as I am doing practice during my off time at my internship. From this subreddit I have found a few things to check out and am doing some intro to VDHL and Verilog and plan on continuing that this summer. My classes are all lined up and in a year from now I will know a hell of a lot more on Hardware design and Signal processing, but I am worried about getting a hardware internship next summer. Any tips for me would be greatly appreciated, recommendations, or even things I can review for interviews if there is a good source. Thanks!

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Biology, and I feel as if that is the biggest mistake I have made for myself. When I started college I was eager to succeed and become a dentist. I never thought about doing anything else besides that, but as my grades plummeted I realized that the path I envisioned just wasn't going to happen. I struggled through my tough science classes and it felt like a drag and it even took me an extra year to complete my bachelors but I finally got the degree that holds zero value for me. Every time I sit and try to come up with a plan on what to do next I feel as if a heavy rock has been placed on me. But the clock is ticking and it doesn't stop for anyone, so I do need to figure out what my next step is on this road to success. So far I have thought about doing nursing, I never wanted to do that but with my background in science and poor GPA it seems to be a valid option. My second thought was completely changing my field of education and trying for the IT field. But for that I have no idea where to beginning from. I know Data Science is a huge growing field right now and they earn well also. But how do I figure out that that is the career path for me? I am afraid to make the wrong choice and regret it later or waste my time. I know, I know, that is life and I cannot be afraid of it if I want to go somewhere. I need to stop thinking the ""buts"" the ""what ifs"" and go for something already, as of right now I'm wasting time regardless. Honestly, I just want to make a lot of money with a slightly easier path than becoming a doctor of some sort. Just look at the Kardasians, living in millions for doing what? I always thought about becoming a Youtuber, I am a creative person, I want to be famous, who doesn't? Or be one of those Instagram models? Why not? It all seems nice to think about but not practical for the future, or I just don't have the courage in me.
What my nursing friends tell me- they started making 93K and only have to work 13 shifts a month- that's like working 150 days out of 356 days. Sounds nice but why hasn't this pushed me to do that then. Going for the corporate world means working a 9-5pm job M-F. I ask myself do I want to wear scrubs for the rest of my life or business wear, nice pencils skirts? And I honestly don't know the answer to any of these questions. Can I get a trial and error at this life. There are an endless amount possibilities I can choose from yet I can't pick any.
The nurses out there, please tell me the pros and cons about what you do. And if this was the route I chose what would my next step be? Should I go for an associates first since my GPA is so low and then do a bridge programs? Is getting a second bachelors degree worth what you guys do?
Anyone in the IT field, (data scientists, QAs, anyone) how do I enter this field with a biology background? Should I find some internship? I looked into those data science boot camps but they seem pricey for something I'm unsure of. Any insight on what your job entails of would help.
Redditters please help me clear up the clutter in my mind, let me know what you would do in my place.
Thank you"

So I'm a student on internship. Recently TD has targeted me with a promo for $300 if I open an account with them. Currently I'm with BMO student plan (no monthly fee's). 

I have the 4k in savings (and a rainy day fund) that I can put in the TD account and just leave it there to avoid the monthly fees. If I consider it a 1 year investment and just leave it in there, have my pay-check routed into the account, then automatically transferred to my main BMO account to get the $300 I'm thinking that it would be a 7.5% return, assuming everything goes right. 

Has anyone tried this before? 
Is it okay to have multiple bank accounts in terms of credit score? 
Aside from needing to keep track of fees and terms are there any other issues I should know? 

Thanks for all the help. "

I'm in a dillema right now... And I really do appreciate any advice on what to do now.

So I've been working at this IT company since february(5 months now) with originally the plan to do an internship there. I hadn't finished all my courses by february which meant I still had to hand in some assignments. This didn't require me to go to class, so I had agreed that I would just start working at the company already. The deadline for the school assignments was in april anyway and I couldn't start with the internship before that. I would just start working there for the same salary as an intern, which I didn't really mind because it was only 2 extra months, it would give me a headstart on my internship and it shows I have work motivation to the company.

Anyway, April comes and I fail the assignments. Which now means I can only start with the internship in september, because of the school year schedule. The way it looks now, is that I would probably have to work here for almost a complete year for like 3 euro an hour.

So I don't really know what to do now, shall I ask for a raise and how? What I actually want to do is quit(take a break) now and come back again in september when the internship assignment starts, because I can just work at my parttime job for 3x as much and I find it way more fun and relaxed as well.

Btw, one reason they gave me before is that I would probably have the same tasks as I would have as an intern. But I'm really not looking forward to working for a complete year on intern salary.

Any advice on what to do? Thanks in advance."
6imbof,9,2017-06-21,Negotiating first job,codetothrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6imbof/negotiating_first_job/,"I've been offered $50k in a low cost of living area for my first job. It's nearby, only a 15 minute commute, and at a very small company. I've been interviewing for three months now, and just graduated a month ago from a state college in the US. I'm pretty tempted to take this job, since its a small company and only a few developers. And its also my first real offer after talking to 5-6 companies and getting rejected. It seems like I could really learn a lot from this position. But I also think they low balled me, as the average in this area is anywhere from $60k on the low end to $70k on the high end for entry level positions. So $50k is quite a low ball to me.

Considering I have a BS in CS, two prior internships, and an active GitHub with side projects posted, how should I negotiate this offer? I  think if I could get them up to $60k I'd be pretty happy, or even as close to $60k as they can go. I get they're a small company so its a lot of risk to take on a new grad, but still, once I'm up and running in a month or two I should be very valuable to them. I'm also willing to risk negotiating with them, since even if they pull the offer, I'm still being considered by at least two other companies. I'm also focusing on improving my technical interviewing, since I've gotten through the phone screen at 5-6 companies and I tend to fail on the tech questions (and the rejection is usually ""You're too junior for us right now, maybe if you had a year of experience we'd be interested).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

This summer, I have an internship every weekday from 9 am to 6 pm. I go by train, so my parents only have to drop and pick me at the local train station, which is a 5 minute drive from home. It takes around 45 minutes to go by train and then there's another 10 minute walk from the station to the office. I basically leave home at 8 am and come home by 7:30 pm (since I come home by train). 

On Tuesdays and Fridays, I leave my internship early to attend an ACT class, which ends at 7:20, and I'm usually home around 7:30 on those days too, as my parents pick me up from class.

In addition, I am taking an online course to prepare for an AP class I will be having this fall.

After dinner every weekday night (around 10:30 pm), I work on the online course for a bit before going to bed. My weakness in bed is my phone. Once I pick it up, I can't put it down. I usually grab it to check an email or do a quick browse through social media, or even to play a quick game. But it's really hard to put it down! I usually don't fall asleep until 2:30 am because I am engrossed and can't put the phone down. Oh, and my bosses are pretty chill, so I have spent up to 2 hours in the past, just browsing my phone at work when they weren't watching me. I also browse my phone during the train ride. It's not like I have 0 free-time outside of home. That's why my phone is my WEAKNESS in bed. 

With this packed schedule, the only time I can adequate amount of sleep is over the weekend. However, I do have practice ACT tests and doctor/dentist appointments scheduled on some Saturday mornings, so it's probably just 1-2 days a week where I am able to sleep to my heart's content. 

How do I stay fresh and motivated with less sleep (4-5 hours)?Is there a special way to wash my face, should I keep drinking water (I'm not a fan of caffeine), etc.? I really feel like I'm a bit more counterproductive with my tight schedule. 

I obviously can't sleep in work, or I'll get fired, and I don't want to get fired because the company offers many incentives that will benefit me when applying to colleges.

Appreciate the advice."
6io1kk,1,2017-06-21,Any suggestions for interesting positions in the South/South West of England?,cscthro17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6io1kk/any_suggestions_for_interesting_positions_in_the/,"I don't want to give out too much identifying information here, but I also want to give you guys enough information so as to be helpful, so I'll do my best.

I graduated a year ago with a first class integrated undergraduate master's degree (I studied for 4 years and ended up with equivalent BSc + MSc) in Maths and Physics from a good UK university (Maths department is consistently top 5 in the UK). I realised about a year and a half into my degree that I should have really studied Computer Science (or Maths and Computer Science), but it was too late, so I did my best to get myself some decent experience, taught myself all the fundamentals of the theory stuff (data structures and algorithms etc) and I learnt to code in Python (to start with). At the end of my second year I had an internship at Google. When I graduated I started at my current job which is in software engineering within defence. At Google I worked in text-to-speech synthesis, and in my current job I've been working mostly with machine learning.

My current job is fine, but not very well paid and the nature of the job imposes some restrictions on my personal life. So I'd like to move jobs. I had an interview last month for a permanent position at Google but unfortunately I was turned down at the final stage. My big restriction is that my partner likes his job where we currently live very much, and has no intention of leaving that job. Additionally, I can't drive (working on it, but it is going to take a while), so I need to find a job that I can get to by public transport, while he can still get to his own job by car. Getting to London is a stretch, but I could do it if it was in the right part of London (sufficiently easily connected), was sufficiently well paid and was a really perfect job.

The other issue is that since I don't have formal Computer Science qualifications, a lot of graduate schemes rule me out, and since I don't have 2 years of experience a lot of the more experienced roles rule me out too. IBM is a big employer that I could commute to, but I think this issue rules me out of most of their roles.

So as a summary, I:

* Have a 1st class 4 year undergrad Master's in Maths and Physics from a good UK uni

* Spent 3 months as an intern at Google working on Text-to-Speech synthesis

* Have spent just under a year working at my current employer working with machine learning

* Have experience coding in Python, Java, C, C++, Matlab

* Have some experience with Android development

and I'm looking for a position:

* that is south of Oxford, east of Bath, west of London (as a rough estimate)

* ideally well-connected by public transport

* that involves lots of hands-on coding-type work, and possibly reading/writing academic papers and reports. I'm not interested in technical consulting type roles (Microsoft do have a presence in Reading but I believe they largely do consulting-type stuff there)

* would ideally like to continue working with machine learning. In a perfect world I'd love to work on something related to language (am currently working with some language recognition stuff), but anything interesting and preferably innovative is a possibility

* ideally something that will involve coming up with *new* ways of doing things rather than just working on implementing things

* that has a fairly laid-back environment. The environment at Google was pretty perfect for me, and I understand that very few places are going to take it quite that far, but just a general sense of having some freedom and relaxation would be great

* EDIT: that ideally has a similar type of situation to Google where you have the option of moving around and doing different things if you so wish

* that has a reasonable work-life balance and ideally some flexibility in hours

* that is reasonably paid

I'm just looking for any companies that might be worth looking into that I might not have thought of. Companies of any size are fine. And if there is nothing that fits all of the stuff listed here, that is fine too. I know there is a lot to take into consideration. I'm also considering staying in my current position for a year and then starting a Computer Science PhD in 2018, so there are other options.

If you've read all of this, thanks! And thanks for any help that I get."

Firstly, I like ECE, but after finding this subreddit and going through a bunch of posts and reading about things like VLSI, signal theory, etc. (basically things I have almost never heard of), I have found that ECE is much more broad than the sort of ""build your own PC"" and ""make cool robots"" mentality that I first imagined. That being said, I still want to pursue ECE, but I don't really know where I'm headed besides ""I want to do stuff with computers one day"". I don't really know how to explain the question I have besides can someone help point me to realize what I want to do in my life, but any guidance would be immensely helpful.


Secondly, I couldn't get an internship this summer, partially because I wasn't super proactive during the school year (regrettably) and partially because I don't have much experience. I have a part time job on campus at a simple IT help desk and my other jobs in the past have centered around tutoring very simple classes not very related to ECE. But next year, I want to go in full force and get an internship at one of my dream companies. I plan on joining one of the many engineering clubs on campus during this upcoming school year, but I'm not completely sure which one interests me the most because of the situation above. But in the mean time, I'm trying to take this summer to gain experience through application, working on personal projects and learning on my own through websites like Code Academy, Lynda (given by my school), W3Schools, and other free resources. Hopefully, I can showcase some of these projects on my resume to kind of balance the lack of related jobs I have. So far, I have created a simple website from scratch using HTML and CSS that I plan to link from my resume and use as my portfolio so I can go more in-depth about my projects. I've also started looking into iOS app development to make apps that I'm personally interested in using to help me out in my day-to-day life. I've learned a decent amount about the Arduino Uno from class and bought a Raspberry Pi 3 (which I have no experience with). I'm a beginner in MATLAB, Python, and AutoCAD and somewhat intermediate in C/C++. I guess my second question is are there any projects/coding languages/resources you guys recommend that could teach me a great deal about ECE? I'm looking for projects that won't hold my hand all the way through and that are somewhat practical (I don't want to waste my family's money on the materials for, say, Robotic Arm if I'll barely ever use it). I know that the answers to this question will vary according to my situation in the first paragraph. That being said, I'd still be open to ideas if you guys genuinely think a certain project will help me out in the long run. I know that this was probably a long read, but I appreciate any input.

In August 2016, I started my PhD in Economics at an Ivy, so I didn't put much thought into what kind of jobs I would want (since I was planning to go into academia). Unfortunately, I did very poorly on my qualifying exams. I have a second chance to pass them, and I plan to give it my best college effort. However, I want to stay realistic about my chances of staying in this program and start thinking about what kind of jobs I can apply to if I fail my exams next month. I have a couple questions that I've been mulling over, and I was hoping to get some advice.

First, I'm not sure how to approach the year of grad school on my resume and in future job interviews. Will it be a good signal (advanced training at a good school) or a bad signal (failed out of a grad program)? I'd probably end up framing it as ""I left the program because it wasn't right for me"" but I'm not sure how that would sound.

I'm also wondering what types of jobs I'm qualified for. I'd be interested in doing jobs related to econ or finance like consulting, math related jobs, politics, data science jobs, or some sort of programming job. I have internship experience in research so I've used programs like Stata and R a lot, and I have some experience with Matlab, C++, and Python. The worry that I have is that my experience with C++ and Python are from two classes in college and a couple hackathons, so I'm much below that of a CS major. I'm willing to spend time learning programming better, but I don't want to be unemployed for a long time. I've heard that some programming jobs hire Math majors, but what level does my programming need to be at to get a job offer? If I did want to study in order to qualify myself for a programming job, what would be the best way to go about it?

I'm happy to provide more information or pm specifics. Any advice on how to approach my future job search or career path is much appreciated. Thanks!"

About two weeks ago a family member forwarded me an email he received from a business partner of his, asking my family member if he knew of any of his nieces/nephews that were looking for a summer internship. Since I fit the descriptions, my family member forwarded the email to me.

I emailed him my resume and had a few questions about the job, to which he replied with a full job description. It seemed like a good fit for me, so I replied and around 1 on June 9th he requested an interview. Since I was out of town and taking summer classes at the time I told him that I'd be able to make it down for an interview late in the workday (around 4:30) or I was available for a phone interview at any time. He said that a phone interview would work, and asked for my availability for the rest of the day (Friday) and the weekend. I let him know that I was available until 8pm on Friday (sent email around 2) and 10am-8pm Sat and Sun. He responded promptly telling me he'd let me know when he chose a time to call. 

By Sunday around 6pm I realized he wasn't going to call, so I emailed him to make sure I didn't miss an email or a call. He apologized and said he was busier than expected over the weekend, and we set up a time for Monday the 12th. 

The interview went well, we talked for about 30 minutes and he told me he would get back to me shortly, as he still had to consider other options. Directly after the interview I emailed him with some specific info he requested (prior planned vacations, that he said was no problem) and thanking him for the interview.

On Friday the 16th I still hadn't heard back from him, so I sent him an email telling him I just wanted to follow to see if any decision had been made regarding the position. He said he was still mulling his options and would give me a call over the weekend. 

Come Tuesday the 20th I still hadn't heard from him, so I sent another email following up and double checking that I hadn't missed him around noon. It's been over a day but he still has not responded. Which is not consistent with all of his other respond times, which were generally within a few hours, and one exception first thing in the morning.

My question is, is it out of the question to give him a call tomorrow? My current job also contacted me on the 9th confirming that I was set to come back on the 24th, to which I was very upfront and honest about, and let my manager knew that the internship would be better for my career and resume, so I wanted to wait on that to see. My current manager was very understanding and wished me good luck.

Now that my summer classes are coming to an end, I need to start making money. While I would greatly prefer to work the internship, I dont feel that I can keep waiting as that is wasting potential time to work. Would it be rude to pester him with a call tomorrow? My gut feel is that someone else has already been chosen, and my email is just being ignored, and that calling him would (hopefully, if he answers) allow me to set my plans for the summer and start working. But I also don't want to look bad, as I am being connected to my family member who is associates with the guy who could hire me. 

So what do you guys think? Any input is appreciated."

I am looking to build a high end, super tiny PC. I would be looking at a Ryzen 1700/1800x or Intel 6700k at at least 4.4ghz, hopeful stable OC to at least 4.6ghz. The computer is for a medical workstation, and I'm not sure right now do the software utilizes the GPU, but that it hits the CPU hard. Unknown if it is multi cored or threaded. The main design goal is size - as tiny as possible, and easily portable.

Just looking for suggestions, and I will post an update when I get more info. Budget now: Unlimited. Go ham. NDME SSD, water cooled, I don't care. Would also like case suggestions. ;)

Thank you!

EDIT: this is barely what you'd consider corporate - it's a small office with one or two doctors and a receptionist and an intern.

EDIT 2: How do I rival the per-core performance of a 7700k, and beat it, in a mini-ITX form factor?

A sales startup in the area is offering to pay me a salary of $350/wk as a \*1099 employee, i.e., in cash, to work as a full-stack developer for them. Without going into too many details, they want an in-house program that will ultimately become the focal point of their business.

I've made websites before, including SPA, MVC, and traditional sites. I'm pretty decent programmer—a good one, even, for a student—but I am very much still learning as a software engineer. I'm hesitant to take the job because this isn't an internship or a trainee position; it's the sole and most senior programming position that they have.

Furthermore, it's a project that will never be completed. Once the basic functionality is in place, they want to start running analytics with both traditional statistical approaches as well as eventually branching into machine learning to optimize their sales approach. I can make the database collect as much information as they want, but analytics isn't a matter of skill or practice; I outright don't know what I'm doing there. If I don't want to make a career out of maintaining this code, then I have to write code and documentation to a quality that would allow a future software engineer to come in and work on it without wasting months just getting up to speed.

I'm already working for them two days per week, but they want me to quit or at least cut back a lot at the hardware store and begin working for them full-time. I'd be able to work from home three days a week. Should I take the job or not, and why?

My current GPA there is 2.21, and my goal was to graduate with at least a 3.00 because I might want to get my masters or show my employers I did not do too awful. I did a future GPA calculator to see what GPA I would have to get each remaining semester, and the results said error because I would have to get a 4.87 GPA, which is impossible.

6ir128,1,2017-06-21,Is a highly-specialized degree worth it if you can be fulfilled by less?,ThatsAllFolks42,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6ir128/is_a_highlyspecialized_degree_worth_it_if_you_can/,"Hi, I'm a 20-something college student trying to finish up college and my limited experience in the work force is leading me to question my career choices up to this point.

I started college pursuing an engineering degree. I've been fortunate enough to have worked internships every summer since my junior year of high school and they have all been in the field of human factors engineering. That specific field is not available at my school (its only available as a graduate program at a few universities across the nation, undergrad programs are super rare). Last summer, I interned at a research facility for human factors and absolutely loved the work there. I would accept a full-time from them immediately if they offered it.

This is where things get a bit complicated. My academic journey has been a mess. I dealt with some very serious medical issues during my sophomore year, missed a semester, and fell behind my cohort. Since returning to school, I've struggled with depression and anxiety (directly tied to the trauma of my chronic illness) in addition to lingering medical issues. As a result, my grades have suffered and I've taken a much lighter course load than would be necessary to graduate on time. If I continued pursuing an engineering degree at this rate, it would take me another two years to graduate (a total of six years in school) assuming no more medical crises, which honestly isn't a safe bet. Because stress can trigger a flare up, and engineering school is never not stressful.

My scholarships run out in December so in an attempt to cobble together a bachelor's degree, I've switched from engineering to an interdisciplinary degree that combines engineering, psychology, and math in the hopes of still finding work in the human factors field (which hires both engineers and psychologists).

I'm not super confident that this degree will get me anywhere, though, especially since human factors is still a relatively small (but growing) field. And there's the understandable stigma associated with interdisciplinary degrees. On top of all of this, my grades were too poor for me to find an internship this summer so I got a job as a summer camp counselor. 

And I haven't had this much fun in years. My internships were always interesting and fulfilling, but I've found that there's a lot of slow points while waiting for grants, project approval, etc. Those times were very frustrating, and I found myself unmotivated when there was only busy work while we waited for the ""real"" work to start. It's a caveat that I'm willing to accept for the work, and I'm sure that as an intern, the low points were worse because there was only the one project to work on rather than multiple like a full-time employee. 

At the camp, the work isn't mentally stimulating the way engineering is, but always having something to do is great and the energy from the kids is infectious. I have helped make lego robots, popsicle stick catapults, and so many, many different types of slime. And it was great. It was exhausting and messy, and as a counselor I was the one cleaning up the messes. But it was still great.

So now I'm having a bit of an existential crisis. Am I really on the right path? I've put a lot of time and energy (not to mention blood, sweat, and tears) into college and I'm going to end up with a degree that's less than what I expected. Is it worth it when I can be fulfilled by something as simple as being a camp counselor? Not that I'm considering that as a career path, but rather, should I be expanding my sights? Money is a big limiting factor. If I could afford it, I'd stay long enough to get a real engineering degree or transfer to someplace that I could get a human factors one. But I've already taken out several hefty student loans, and my GPA is too miserable at the moment for scholarships to be a real consideration, especially as there are so few available to upperclassmen and transfers.

Anyone else with a similar situation or some insight from further down the road? I understand getting my grades up is the first step to solving some of my issues (and believe me, I'm working my ass off to fix that). But some advice on choosing the direction I'll pursue would be extremely helpful.

Thanks for taking the time to read my long and rather messy post. Cheers!"

I've applied to any job I could find regardless of experience needed or pay or anything really in the software industry. I live in Wisconsin and I've applied to jobs in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and even in places like Kentucky and Missouri and I've gotten no replies or follow ups whatsoever.

 In college I didn't have any sort of senior project and I never had an internship (my GPA was extremely low at a 2.108 and I flunked several semesters after an extreme bout of depression and a few suicide attempts that landed me in the ER) so there's not much I can put on my resume outside of some of the basic skills I learned in school.

I have about 100k in student debt and work at an Applebee's kitchen to make ends meat and live in a rundown house in the middle of nowhere with 4 other guys. There's black mold everywhere and the roof leaks and the deck out back collapsed and tore a huge chuck outta the house where we had to nailgun tarps over it so water doesn't get in. We have spotty satellite internet that is very slow since we live in a rural area about 20 minutes outta the nearest town. I haven't coded anything since getting out of college.

Right now I can barely afford to live, I pay all my money for rent and my student loans and car stuff and living expenses and only have about $30 a week or so to my name so it's hard for me to buy anything.

Is there any point in looking for a job in the computer industry given my lack of experience? I'm so far behind so many other people it's hard to even make a case for myself. I don't have the financial security to move to another house or buy anything larger than a McDonald's lunch so I need to find something in my area. Not only that, but I just realized I don't even own a good pair of dress clothes or even a tie. I'd have to go to goodwill to find a lot of my stuff. Is it even worth the effort or should I just cut my loses with my degree and continue along with my life?"

Mot'r had his doubts about this so called ""Repair Station"".

Spinning lazily in an orbit around the last gas giant at the very fringes of the system, it lacked the security and regulations that anything nearer the core worlds would have. A few minor point defence lasers for any approaching meteors were all that stood between them and possible pirate raids. 

The hull was... odd. It was almost as though it were still constructing itself, half the surface sleek, seamless metal, the other a veriable mess of patches, welds and random ship parts bolted on.

But what really got him worried were the ""prices"". Broken components. Scrap materials. One or two items from cargo, if the damage was substantial enough. Nothing like decent Credit transfer that could be recorded or tracked. Only those with something to hide dealt with *barter* these days.

Curiosity was always his worst weakness however, costing him several deals in the past, and on a whim he sent a request for an assessment on his merchantile ship. The last jump into the system knocked something in the engine loose, so he would be forced to dry dock at some point anyway.

The form sent back was... invasive, to put it mildly. His race, occupation, ship model and condition... then it went into his cargo, optional upgrades for minor resource fees, his business in the sector...

With a clicking of spines, he tapped out the information, reminding himself he still had sub-FTL capacity if things started to look sketchier, letting thrusters drift him towards the extending docking clamps and umbilical. The graspers clung onto the hull with surprising care, potentially to avoid causing more damage.

Clamouring through the microgravity of the umbilical, spines flattened as much as possible, Mot'r found himself in an, again, surprisingly well maintained rest stop. A general, if slightly too large cot, several vending machines converted to add an appropriate value of resources to his bill as opposed to taking credits, and even an up to date selection of basic entertainment.

A wall screen to his left lit up and rolled off a list of problems and potential upgrades, a small toggle by each of them confirming what he did and didn't want touched. The figure at the bottom of the list was... reasonable. More than reasonable in fact, even if the loss of a whole crate of Flaxan spices caused him to grumble. It wasn't as though he didn't have plenty of other crate for sale, but the very act of letting merchandise go for no monetary compensation grated against his trader's soul.

A quick retinal scan later, and he sat down on the cot with the latest gossip rag in hand, eying the timer with suspicion.

Five hours for almost a complete re haul? He'd believe that when he saw it...

""Team Alpha! Engine diagnostic and repair! Team Beta! Cable chasing, find me where those shorts are happening! Delta, I want you looking into the life support, the air tastes a little stale! Gamma...""

The foreman barked out orders as the small ten to fifteen person teams grabbed their kits, readying themselves at the base of the umbilical for deployment. Already Alpha team had set off in their pneumatically propelled shuttle, first responders should anything in the engine be setting up for a meltdown.

Schematics of the new ship were data mined and transferred to all team leads, foreman and commander pouring over the readouts and following likely problem areas.

""Our guest looks anxious.""
The foreman directed a team towards a potentially warping support strut before answering, not looking up from the screen.

""He's a first timer, let him be anxious. Results speak for themselves.""

""All I'm saying is that hiring one giant to be the face of the statio-""

""And here I thought we were meant to be a secret.""

The staff on the bridge exchanged knowing glances and ducked their heads back down to their work. They could feel the recurring argument brewing I the air, and many an intern was suddenly ""called away"" before the inevitable explosion could occur.

""Have you heard the rumours!? They think we're either a ghost ship or an AI!""

""Good! Curiosity brings customers!""

Engine delving was easily the cushier job on the station. Hanging from a thick cable, lowered into the bowels of an acting up reactor, the steady tick of the Geiger counter in your suit accompanying your heartbeat... relying on the folk above you not to lose their grip and send you plummeting into a radioactive abyss...

Yeah, real cushy.

Magnetic clamps attached the unfortunate volunteer to the wall of the reactor, hissing air through his teeth as he examined the crack through the bar that maintained structural integrity. It was holding, for now, but if it slipped any more then the next time they tried going FTL they were more likely to go supernova than anything else.

Thankfully it was an easy fix, a spot welder and several bars of high grade titanium patching and filling the cracks.

It was too bad they had already taken payment for the work, working inside the engine was hardly the safest task. As he tugged the cable a few times and disconnected his magnets, he kept his mind firmly on the Spices that would keep the kitchens going for at least three months...

""What did I ask you not to do?""

""Turn on Gravity""

""And what did you do?""

""... Turned on the gravity.""

The two engineers swayed slightly as they held onto a near invisible seam on the wall, mentally thanking shoddy construction for providing an impromptu handhold for the pair of them.

The call for RatBat assistance went out half an hour ago, both of them knowing that the sudden request would result in pilots scrambling for they and their mounts harnesses. A day of rest for the usually overworked rescue/ventilation inspecting team, all because someone had to ram a wire back into place at the wrong time.

The junior engineer shuddered and redoubled his grip. A solid year inspecting the giant's plumbing was easily in his future...

""... 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer-""

""I will drop kick you down this shaft and no jury would convict me, so help me God...""

[

[

The engine wasn't shrieking as it powered up.

His throat wasn't itchy every time he breathed in.

The caffeinated beverage machine was actually producing something drinkable.

And all with half an hour spare.

Mot'r signed over the scrap and various synthetic materials without hesitation, barely even giving the spice crate a second look before scrabbling to start up the launch sequence. There were rumours about this place... the spirits of pilots who died due to faulty ships, or the AI slowly co strutting itself an army... He never paid them any mind before now, but this place was far, far too good to be true.

As soon as the clamps were released he was away, full burn for the core worlds, even as he watched a rather beaten up frigate drift closer to the space he had vacated, muttering prayers of protection under his breath as he firmly put the empty station behind him...

6itcu4,5,2017-06-22,"Would love some feedback on pre-MBA MBB exit opps' impact on MBA, and other questions?",careerquestions1397,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/6itcu4/would_love_some_feedback_on_premba_mbb_exit_opps/,"X-post from r/consulting, since I haven't yet gotten any responses. 

Hello everyone,

I am at a MBB currently, with about 2 years of experience. It looks like I may not get the promotion to my firm's post-MBA level, and am considering exit opps.

First of all, I am highly interested in energy- namely, renewables. My thought is to try to exit to a corporation (say, a major utility like Exelon, PGE, Southern Edison, AES) in their corp strategy department.

A few questions based on this:

1. I have thought about PE some as I have a finance internship under my belt (during college) and have done a fair bit of due diligence work at my firm. I'd have to do a lot of prep, and the fact that I may not even break in and don't truly want to do it are deterring me. At the same time, the compensation variance is such that I can't ignore it outright. My friends entering are generally making $200-250k as associates less than 3 years out of college. Should I bite the bullet and try to work for a year or two at a MM firm just to try it out? (I'd never aim megafund) I worry that this path will be closed to me after this point in my career.

2. If I exit to corp now, I am worried about a few factors:

a. Impact on my MBA app (really curious to hear thoughts on this). If I were to apply out of my MBB, placement would essentially be guaranteed (per our internal acceptance numbers) at an M7, with high probability of Wharton/Kellogg at a minimum. I worry that working at a slower moving firm would hurt my MBA prospects- I actually don't care about prestige (unless H/S, I'm indifferent to rest of M7), but I do care that my scholarship chances could decline. I value financial security a lot, and would gladly attend Haas with a half ride over Wharton with nothing. I got a 750 on the GMAT, for what it's worth.

b. The slow advancement and lower pay at one of the utilities I might work at. Most quicker career trajectories involve moves between companies. But innovative utilities are not that many. I worry that if I cannot advance quickly, and my exits are constrained (at least to do what I want to do), I'll be left in a tough spot.

c. Other corp exit opps besides in energy- I've seen some colleagues exit to one of Google/Apple/Microsoft/Amazon from my position into a manager role, making $120-125k salary and 20-30k bonus- near post-MBA levels. Part of me thinks I should aim to do that instead vs entering at senior individual contributor level in a major utility, even though that's the industry I want to work in long term. That way, I get past the manager hurdle, capture a higher salary, and then could potentially exit to corp Strat in the aforementioned energy companies at a later date.
If I could swing manager role at an energy firm, obviously that would be ideal, but definitely would be unprecedented per scrapes I've done on LinkedIn.

Really appreciate any insight you all might have. Thanks so much!"

I'll definitely mention threadripper. He doesn't really believe paying a company to do it will cost him a lot of money. Took half of the budget as all example now. But I reckon if I can convince him of the value of making the system yourself we could easily scale up to something more later, ex threadripper.*

Just to introduce this post after the perhaps weird title. I intern at a small design company. (7 people work here including me) and we make visuals for ads, web etc. Basically Adobe programs, Autodesk (Maya) Zbrush some video. Typical workstation stuff.

Now we currently run 3930K systems with 32gb of ram, Intel 750 x4 ssd's and a 128gb sata bootdrive (I believe it's a Kingston, not sure). My boss expressed he wants to upgrade our systems. He contacted a few companies supplying Workstations. He told me HP quoted him 10k for 3 new workstations. I told him you can do far cheaper than that. Probably half. Seems easily doable too me. We won't get the service HP offers in that price, but considering the systems we have now have been holding up for their life-time with 0 issues I dont think the insurance on 'part' failure is a big deal for a small company like us.

He said, alright, you come up with 3 workstations for 5k and we'll look at it. The HP Systems were based on the Intel 8 core (Broadwell-E). 


So, with Ryzen this task isn't too difficult. But I would love some input from you guys. 



**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Design work,  3d,  2d, video. Various things.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

No gaming.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

5000/3 = 1666 euro per workstation. It's important all 3 machines are equal. Same parts, same performance.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**
Netherlands. I'm not new to building PC's. So if the parts are general suggestions that fine. Using German PCPartPicker for example should be similar enough for me to source our parts. Please ignore tax returns and such for now. 

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

EDIT:
I came up with this. Pricing seem to be higher than I expected regarding ram and gpu's. Didn't manage to fit in a 1800X. And I'm not entirely convinced of overclocking system that need longevity and stability above all.

The machines need 64gb of ram and they need a CUDA GPU. Most applications run mostly on CPU but some things are CUDA accelerated.

As these are workstations and will be used for then 5 years or so. Reliability is important. Failures would be very very unfortunate so quality brands and machines have the priority over saving a few bucks here and there. 

Also, silent builds are nice. No need for them to be extremely quiet but if it's considered that would be nice.

Also, perhaps goes without saying, but how it looks is irrelevant, no need for RGB's or pretty parts, matching colors whatever.


Thanks a lot in advance everybody."

Reflecting back I felt extremely depressed about my first year. I got rejected from all the clubs I applied to, so I am not in any club yet. I also had signficant pressure about coursework, as all my friends around me are already experienced programmers. They are all doing research/ interns now while I am not doing anything(I do practice programming skills on my own tho).
Most importantly, I felt lonely and insecure here. I do get social and make a lot of friends, yet it's a rather shallow kind of friendship. Everyone around me seems so busy and put-together. I constantly doubted myself if I am being too pussyish and fragile.

I know I can visit gannett/ears. but my problem it's not serious to that extent. I'm sure many of you have been through similar struggles and coped with them successfully. Can you share some advice on that? I would appreciate them very much!"

My offer to Apple is 12-16 months and it's pretty unique in terms of workload, I've heard mixed things about Apple as an employer and I guess it depends on the team but from what I've heard the team I'll be working for is pretty great for internships.

The other option is a stealth startup that was founded by ex-apple employees, they're only willing to disclose information about the company if I accept the offer. Also their offer is 4 months.

Option 1:
Apple

Pros: Tech corp experience, more structure, higher salary

Cons: Bureaucracy, possibly menial work







Option 2: Stealth startup

Pros: Significant impact at company, more impact=more enjoyment

Cons: Startup may flop, black mark on resume, Lower pay &amp; only 4 months

I have been overwhelmed with so many job boards to skim through and different career paths to choose from that I hardly know where to start. I am currently applying to anything and everything I see that is even remotely related to GIS work, but I know there has to be a smarter and easier way of doing this, which brings me here. I would like to know what a current GIS professional would say to a younger version of themselves as they are about to enter the ""real world"". Any advice, tips, places to look, opportunities they wish they had taken, anything.

Just to give you an idea of who I am and where I'm coming from, I have a Bachelor's degree in Geography and in Environmental Studies, as well as the MSGIS that I am finishing up. I'm currently interning with Florida Fish and Wildlife, and would really like to stay on the environmental side of GIS. I'm interested in getting out of Florida (I've been a Flor-idiot my entire life) but I'm not attached to any one place, although the Northwest sounds nice. In all honesty I'd love to travel if that were an option but I really just need a job ASAP, so that isn't a major factor. I would enjoy getting to spend some time out in the field, as being locked in a computer lab 8 hours a day, 5 days a week isn't my favorite part about the job, but I also understand that a large majority of the work I will be doing will be on a computer, so getting outside isn't very likely to happen. I enjoy doing statistical analysis in R and I'm currently teaching myself Python, which is fun and interesting to me. I've worked with most of the major software (ArcGIS, Erdas Imagine, QGIS, etc.) so I feel like I could go in a lot of different directions.

I guess the largest factor to me is getting paid. All of my schooling was rather expensive and now I'm left with a large sum of student loan debt looming over me, so another unpaid internship or some job that comes with a small weekly living allowance isn't really a great option for me. I am extremely flexible with working anywhere, anytime, doing just about anything in GIS, as long as I could make some money and gain some on the job experience. I feel like I can always move into a different area once I get my head above water financially.

TL;DR
As a GIS professional, what would you say to a younger version of yourself as you were about to enter the workforce?"

I graduated from school in 2016 with a BS in Computer Engineering and have been looking for work with little to no success. I've been applying to places since about last September but I've only had a single in-person interview in that time. I've been lucky to be in a position to live with my parents without being excessively rushed time wise or financially but a year is far to long to go with nothing to show for it. I started off relatively picky in the positions I would apply for, but now I'll apply to anything in a place I would be fine living and is software related (I didn't particularly care for the hardware side of my degree).

&amp;nbsp;

I know I'm not the most lucrative applicant, no internship experience and GPA of around 3.1 but I didn't expect to get so stonewalled in my job search. I've made a website and put info/links to the major school projects I worked on that can be displayed. Also I've been working in the Unity Game Engine, developing a small 2D game and learning the C# language since graduation, so I haven't been completely idle outside of sending in applications. 

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Since I'm back at home I've been just searching through online job sites, LinkedIn, GlassDoor, etc and filling out appropriate resumes and cover letters. I don't live in an area where there are many jobs available that are in my industry so for the most part in-person applications are not an option. I should mention that I also have a LinkedIn profile, linked with some old classmates and friends, although it could likely be improved, I didn't focus on networking as much as I should have while in school.

Reason being I've done some internships and realized writing software is just not that fun, I like the science of computer science and the theory/mathematics behind things. Secondly, I want to work in ML/AI/industry research such as developing driverless cars or doing something interesting with computer vision. 

At the moment, I have decent grades (83 average, not sure what GPA that is) as well as solid work experience (4 months with Google, 4 months with Thomson Reuters). No URA, research experience, and am not particularly close with any professors (ie will get weak ref letters if I ask now). Lastly, the school I'm studying in isn't particularly known for research (Waterloo) and literally none of my peers are interesed in anything besides finding internships so it's difficult to know where to begin. I would really appreciate advice on what I can do now to prepare a good application - I am aiming for top US schools (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CMU, etc) as well as U of Toronto.

Some brief questions:

1. Do grad schools look at the quality of the school? Ie is Waterloo reputable enough for it to be a bonus on my application?

2. How do I approach a professor about research? Should I read into his/her work before then ask? 

3. How solid does my URA have to be for top US schools? Do I need to actually publish anything or place well at a conference?

4. Does my research have to be directly related to what I want to do in grad school? Or is it like going from high school to undergrad where any extracurricular is looked favorably, regardless of relevance to program?

5. Do grad schools care about my work experience?

Thanks."

I am a senior electrical engineering undergraduate student and have recently started my first internship at a national research lab.

By and large, I understand the broad strokes of the project I have been assigned (good news). However, there is a substantial amount of additional research that I am conducting in order to get up to the point of being able to contribute to the team. I have spent my first week reading a variety of journals/articles/textbook entries in an attempt to fill the knowledge gap.

This is working, sort of. I'm at the point of approaching two dozen articles that I need to be fairly familiar with and am no where near the end. I am concerned that I will begin confusing facts/forgetting key points. I have attempted to annotate the PDFs, but this seems cumbersome and decentralized. The variety of papers and formats also do no lend themselves to my typical academic note-taking approach.

My question: how do you stay organized when performing background research before tackling a new project? Do you have any advice for an engineer just starting their professional career?

I hope that's at least slightly clear. Thank you for your help! "

We've gone down a hard road that had paid off for all of us.

So I am a mechanical engineering graduate who has been a year out of college.  Last month I passed my FE exam and have already submitted the paperwork to become certified.  Before I was certified I was given an offer by the federal government to work as a general engineer for the General Services Administration.  Unfortunately hiring freeze came and froze out my position so I have been applying like mad and trying to reach out to my network and expand as I go along.

It has been a year since I got my degree.  I am becoming very concerned that when interviewers look at me they'll see this gap and without any internships to back up my resume they'll know I have no professional experience and only an EIT to show for it.  I feel I'm perpetually stuck in this loop and no one seems to want me. 

I've decided I want to try to become more marketable by taking adult classes in my field to expand my knowledge and even taking on smaller jobs such as tutoring but I feel like I am sidetracking myself.  My question is how are you guys dealing with the fact when you have no professional experiences and very little calls coming back?

Here it is in a nutshell:

- In less than a year I will graduate with a BS in Computer Science from a fairly reputable school with three years of internship experience and a ~3.75 GPA. I am doing undergrad research and am trying to publish a cool research paper relating to security for IOT devices

- I am a jack of all trades and a master of nothing (dabbled in research, backend programming, lots of dev ops type of work, little bit of frontend here and there) and am a philosophy minor (probably my true calling)

- I love to travel. I live near the Boston area, and was thinking I might just settle for a job near home, but I am seriously considering up and leaving the US and trying to work abroad. Right now I am interning for a startup in Hong Kong and I am absolutely loving it. I am not much of a city person though, and living expenses here are high so I would appreciate input on other good options for a US-born (always open to learning new languages, though)

- I like the chill startup atmosphere, even though the work is demanding (I work about 10 hours a day as an intern right now)

- In my previous two internships I absolutely hated the work because I didn't feel a personal connection with it. Ideally, I think working for a non-profit (to feel some sense of purpose) or with people who I can form close connections with will be a healthy environment for me

- CS majors from my college make an average of $80,000 out of graduation, and while I am not a genius by any means, I have worked very hard and am fairly competent. However, I don't measure success by how much money I make. I just want a simple, comfortable job.

- I am doing undergraduate research which is pretty fascinating, but I don't want to immediately pursue my Masters/PHD since it would really cost (though, I am considering it now that I have been exposed to research and actually enjoy it). Not sure if I should work for a few years then consider doing full time masters or...

Sorry for all the info. TL;DR I have good grades, I would very much like to travel if possible, or even live in another country. I prefer relaxed environment/meaningful job (in relation to helping others) over making lots of money, and if possible, I might like to get my Masters/PHD at some point but I am not sure. I live near the Boston area (New Hampshire). What kinds of jobs should I apply to/where should I travel/what has worked for you guys?"

College has been a blessing for me to get away from home and to experience things for myself and meet some great people. Although I've had A LOT of hardships and struggled with depression, I've also made great memories so far.

This summer, I got a 9-5 internship at a software company. I had to move for it, and it was hell just trying to find a place short term. I'm still in the process of moving. It's all been a lot and it hasn't been positive. The internship is also very boring and makes me extremely depressed to know that this is what my future will consist of (Will it?) I feel distant from the people there, I feel like I can't really be as casual as my personality is. Like everything has to be professional when you're an adult. Not to mention the 9-5 life is draining and it makes me feel like a slave for money. So I get out everyday around 5 or 6pm and that doesn't leave me with that much time to do anything. I'm in an area where I don't know anybody and there's nothing for me to do, and I get even more depressed. I start thinking about how life would be if I had kids on top of it all. I don't want to become another one of those robotic adults but it seems like society can force you to be.

I've been trying to do little things that make me happy like working out or walking in a park but I mostly just lay in bed and go online or something. I just feel unfulfilled and out of place in the real world and I'm wondering if this is how it will always be for me since I already struggle with depression.

Has anyone ever felt this way? Does it get better? Are there ways to enjoy life with a full time job? Am I just having a bad experience and being way too anxious? And any other input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

6j12ni,8,2017-06-23,Been feeling unsatisfied for a while; is it time for me to move on?,AFriendInAHighPlace,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6j12ni/been_feeling_unsatisfied_for_a_while_is_it_time/,"Hey /r/ITCareerQuestions!  
  
I've been trying to find the right way to write this for a bit now. I hope this wall of text makes sense and adequately describes my situation.  
  
I've been feeling unsatisfied with my job lately. Is it time for me to move on? Have I gotten all I'm going to get out of this job?  
  
Some Background:  
I've been in IT for ~7 years now. I'm the System Administrator (Read: One Man Shop) for a small Defense Contractor and have been here for ~5 years. I was originally hired as an intern. However, that only lasted for about 6 months before I had free reign over the network. I've been responsible for *most* of our systems ever since, and *all* of our systems for about 3 years. (Including classified systems.) Despite that, my title was only recently (in the past 9 months) changed to System Administrator. My boss recently left, so I am now the only dedicated IT employee at this company. Although I'm full time and salaried, I'm paid well below the industry average for a SysAdmin.  
  
I've learned a lot and done a lot at this job. When I first started, I thought I was tough shit because I knew how to update a linux server and exit the command prompt without X-ing out. But now I've become well versed in CentOS and Windows Server (with some Cisco networking thrown in there, too.) When I started, this company didn't have Active Directory, Exchange, VLANs, VPN, a proper firewall, or any documentation; I've implemented them all. Suffice to say this network is in much better condition than when I started here. I also recently acquired my Security+!  
  
Anyway, for the last several months, I've been feeling unsatisfied. I don't necessarily dread coming to work, but I suddenly feel lethargic and unmotivated. I feel agitated when people come into my office to ask for help, but I don't know why. I've tried the common suggestions of taking email off my phone (and not checking it when I'm not at work), eating lunch away from my desk, taking a week off. But, alas, I still feel the same way. I've talked with the owner (who is now my de-facto boss) about it, and he gave me some sage advice about making sure to disconnect and take care of myself. He also encouraged me to take that week off. Pondering on it more, I wonder if being an IT generalist might have something to do with it. Being expected to be the expert on everything is stressful!  
  
Is it time for me to move on? I don't think this place has any intention of ever paying me the industry average (or close to it.) I don't have a degree, so I was told that if I acquire an MCSE, Sec+, A+, Net+, Server+, Linux+, and CCNA, then I would be able to ""make significantly more money"". But, thinking about it more, I suspect that they said this knowing that it would likely take a couple years to rack up so many certs, and thus wouldn't have to worry about it for some time. I can understand needing some form of pedigree, but that seems like an absurd amount of certs to me!  
  
I feel a loyalty to this place because they've done a lot of favors for me. For example: When I was part time, I needed to go to the hospital. When I told them about it, I was made 3/4 time the very next day so I could get health insurance for the future. When I was having trouble paying my student loans, I was given a small raise so it would be less of a burden. So they obviously care about their employees, but I also don't think there's much more room for me to advance monetarily.  
  
What are your thoughts, ITCQ?"
6j1e4t,1,2017-06-23,It's too late to get the life I want,dgsdfgsdfg34,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6j1e4t/its_too_late_to_get_the_life_i_want/,"So I envisioned in myself a great life where I would be married go a lovely, beautiful, wife, have a few kids, live in a nice house and be at the top of my career game. 

Now that seems all but impossible. I recently graduated with a civil engineering degree but I have no job lined up. I accrued internship experience like I was suppose to but no job at the end of the tunnel. I know I should've networked, I would do anything to go back and focus on networking and making a ton of friends in school. 

Now this would be ok if I was 22 or even 24, but I'm not. I'm 27 years old. Starting my career when I am 28 is far too late. I'm 4 years behind everyone else. 

On top of that I don't have as much experience with women as the average guy my age, just a couple girlfriends. Most guys my age have had several fwb, as well as a couple **long term** gfs 

In my observation, most girls over the age of 22 are either taken, massive sluts, overweight, ugly, retarded, or mentally ill. Many times it is a combination. On the other hand, feminists have created a stigma of ""older men"" dating younger women. No one is going to introduce their 20 year old friend to a 30 something year old man as a potential girlfriend. 

Seriously the next time someone says something about age gaps and ""sick old men"" I will bash their baby's head into a wall and tell them this is what it's like to go through some real hardship bitch. I'll laugh and enjoy their sorrow and tell them it is just a splinter compared to the agony I face. 

Luckily I just turned 27 so getting my career started at early 27 is fine but if I don't get started by the end of the summer I'm going to drown myself in a farmer irrigation lake. There's just no way I'm going to be able to live life on my terms. I'm deathly afraid of being alone but I'm also deathly afraid of marrying a ""reformed"" slut and getting divorce raped. 

If anyone knows of someone who started late in life **and** is still married to their first wife who **wasn't hooking up with random men** by all means talk about them. Until then there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

Hi! Looking to move from UK to Canada as a fresh MSci Computer Science graduate (with a strong first class degree) looking for software engineering jobs. For the past few months I've been applying to loads of different jobs and companies online, using LinkedIn and other sources.

I've never had a job before and basically I want to know whether the problem's *me* (or my CV) or if my experiences are normal and finding a job this way is a waste of time or something.

Over the course of three months, maybe more, I've probably applied to 15-20 jobs, and I've not had literally any progress with any of them. No interview or anything. The jobs have all been junior roles, graduate roles and internships.

At this point I don't know if I'm just wasting my time or if there are companies that will accept people without legal right to work. Is there a particular *type* of company to apply for? I had heard this was the best/easiest way to immigrate."

My University (which I have not even attended yet) offers a way to find new careers and internships, and one that I found was an internship as a webdev/designer for a small startup company that deals with managing social media and design. Last time I had coded HTML/CSS was in Middle School, and I only know Javascript due to a report I needed to make last year for a class.

I applied anyways.

The very next day I got an e-mail from the startup wanting to setup an interview and asked to bring a resume and a **portfolio**.

Shit.

I have never built a website in my life and all my programming projects were irrelevant to the position. What sort of portfolio could I even build? That same night I started learning HTML/CSS through Youtube videos and by the next morning I had built a very small but responsive website that doubled as a resume, but was almost identical to the tutorial video. Stock pictures, some paragraphs, everything built with only HTML/CSS.

I went to the interview and presented the website and they seemed unimpressed, but were already talking of meeting days and work related items. My first day is this Monday as my regular job has me off that day. I landed the damn thing with a website that only exists in my laptop locally and with a night's worth of crash courses.

At the moment, I am using Udemy to watch The Complete Web Development Bootcamp and it is great, but I am not sure how much I will be able to learn this weekend to provide a website I can actually be proud of.

Besides continuing the course, are there any resources you guys might want to recommend to be ready this coming Monday? Anything I should expect?"

My intended major is Computer Science and I'm just kinda stuck on safeties, and a little bit stuck on matches. I live in Virginia, so right now my safeties, or actually, safety, is Virginia Tech. That's the only school that I'm reasonably confident I'll get in to and can also see myself having fun at. The other classic safety schools such as George Mason, James Madison, VCU, etc., I can't see myself attending. Mostly because of the huge amount of people from my high school who enroll.

Matches are kind of an issue for me too. Right now they are UVA, William and Mary, and U of Washington. I'm having a hard time finding colleges that have a good atmosphere, give lots of financial aid, and are also good for Computer Science.

Any suggestions?"

I'm currently planning on studying and acquiring the necessary skills during my free time. I've been patient but can't help but be frustrated at not having a job right now. To add to that, should I be looking for any type of part-time work in the meantime? I've been applying to entry level office positions such as being an admin assistant or someone who does data entry. Should I continue doing that? Or should I look for an internship position since I have no prior relevant experience?

I’ve just recently graduated from university (May 2017) with a BS in Computer Science, and I haven’t been able to land an interview. I’ve applied to about 40-50 entry level positions, and I haven’t had a single call back. I’ve applied to every possible entry level job in my area (Phoenix, AZ), with no luck whatsoever.




A little about me: I graduated with a GPA of 3.41, I have 1 internship under my belt, and worked on a senior group project under the direction of developers at a big name insurance company. I’ve also had my resume reviewed at a resume type workshop, so I don’t think that is the issue. Currently, I have a daily routine of going through job board sites such as Glassdoor, Indeed, and Dice, applying to any/all recently posted jobs.





Is this common among recent graduates? I feel like I’m stuck in some sort of rut, and am looking for anyone that has been in a similar situation. Is it just bad luck?

6j9c2t,2,2017-06-24,Is this offer worth it or can I do better? Entry-level development in the DC/VA area,csguy83484562,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6j9c2t/is_this_offer_worth_it_or_can_i_do_better/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible without leaving out important detail.

I just graduated with a B.S. in computer science from a decently known (in the region) school with a good CS program. I have had 0 internships and have no prior industry experience. My GPA was low, below 2.5 cumulative, slightly above 2.5 CS.

I was too busy to apply for jobs during my last semester, so I've only been hunting for about a month now. I've applied to about 20 positions, I've heard back from 3, one of which I could not work for due to no preexisting clearance which they required. Another place wanted me as a QA associate, they had not yet made a formal offer but they informed me their salary range was $40k-$50k for the position. That felt low to me so I moved on.

Last job of the 3 made me an offer for $60k. This is the current offer I am considering. The company is a small contractor for government work, I would be doing development, position is of course entry-level. Area is DC metropolitan, technically in northern VA.

Other things to know about the job:  
 * insurance benefits are priced well  
 * vacation/sick days are standard  
 * I would get a basic level security clearance out of it  
 * claimed pay range for my position is $50k-$60k, so they're starting me at the top of what they claim they can afford. Already attempted to counter offer, no dice as they claim the contract will not allow for any higher compensation for my position.  
 * development will be primarily in C#, not sure if C# is considered an important or good language skill to have?

So ultimately, I still feel $60k is low for the area, and I'm not sure if I should keep looking or settle for this as a starter job.

Considering I've applied to 20 jobs and only had 3 hits, I'm a bit worried about how long it may take if I throw this offer out and keep looking. My time is somewhat limited, I can't afford to stay at home for more than a few more months. I feel that my lack of internship/professional experience and my low GPA will work against me. Of the 20 positions I've applied to, about 6 have been with big/bigger name companies. I have not heard back from any of those.

A little bit more about my skills:  
 * Proficient: Java, C, Python  
 * Familiar: C++, C#, Ruby, SQL, HTML, JS  
 * I have an InfoSec certification earned as part of my degree. I took specific courses to earn it.  
 * I have done big semester project work with agile development, database/web dev, network cyber security, and robotics.

**So, considering the offered compensation, the area, and my skills, is $60k starting a decent offer that I should go for, or would I have a good chance of finding something better if I hold out?**"

First of all, I want to explain why I am an high school dropout:

When I was a kid, I got bullied a lot and was a social outcast, so I never got along with other children and I started to develop some anxiety disorders that were worsened by some big traumas I had during my early teenage years. 
I started high school but couldn't keep going because I had a lot of panic attacks. 


And here I am now, after years of therapy and finally getting better, trying to make something that I feel like is impossible happen. 
Unfortunately my country has no ""program"" such as the American GED so I can't get a diploma in the near future. 
I started learning programming semi-seriously 4 years ago, and from there I got to a decent level in web development, but I obviously can't find a job, not even an internship because of my lack of diploma. 

What's your opinion on this? Should I try to freelance maybe and build a portfolio? 

Thank you for your attention, sorry for the wall of text and I hope my English is fine. 

TL;DR: anxiety messed up my life and I can't find a job. "

What do you recommend I do?

Anyways, five years ago when I went off to college, I don't really think I was ready or wanted to go to college, it was mostly just something I was doing because my parents pressured me to and wanted me to do and were paying for. But in 2012 if I could have chosen between going to college and doing another year of high school, I definitely would have chosen high school. I wasn't ready to take care of things on my own, and I wasn't ready to take college-level classes, and I didn't really have much in common with other young adults (still basically felt like a young teenager mentally). 

I started out a computer science major, but didn't like it and didn't have the academic skills or motivation to complete it. I had an undiagnosed learning disability for a lot of college as well so I would put in a lot of effort in my classes and wouldn't see results from that at all. This caused me to be very depressed and put less and less effort into my computer science classes. I switched to business and made my computer science a minor, and doing this set me back an extra year. I did fairly well in business overall. The year before last Summer I searched for internships (admittedly didn't put a lot of effort into that) and was unsuccessful in finding any. The year before this Summer I searched for jobs and paid internships (which I did put quite a bit of effort into) and was unsuccessful in finding any again, though I did have quite a few interviews, just never got past that stage. I feel like applying to any kind of graduate school would be a waste of time because my GPA is below a 3.0 (failed a lot of classes when I was a computer science major, but my major GPA is decent, well above a 3.0). 

Right now I'm just working at a local Sandwich shop and focusing on that. I plan on going back to school in the fall and taking more classes for a supplementary data science concentration program. I don't know how much that will help me find a job though?

As for friends and social things, I have Asperger's Syndrome, so social things have historically been difficult for me, but in my childhood it wasn't hard for me to find friends. I never really jived well with my college body though. When I got there I had very little interest in making friends, I just kind of went in with the mentality of ""I want to get my degree and get out,"" due to the aforementioned not wanting to be there. I never went to any parties or did anything crazy, which honestly part of me regrets (though maybe I wouldn't have liked parties since I don't drink or dance). Despite this I made friends in my dorm building partway through Freshmen Year, and we remained good friends for a year. Partway through Sophomore year we had a falling out due to misunderstandings and mistakes both me and my friends made, and while we're on decent terms now (judging by times I saw them on campus after that) I don't think any of them have any interest in hanging out with me any more. 

After that though, my experience with trying to make friends has been kind of miserable. I lived in a single apartment after that since dorms were mostly for Freshmen/Sophomores. I joined a club junior year, and I was initially pretty happy with that; it was a club for something I was passionate about and the people in it seemed really cool. However, I always got the impression they found me annoying and didn't like having me around. I think I said something hurtful by accident once, and I think I was just really awkward (because of aforementioned AS). In subsequent years I was a lot less active and only showed up to a few meetings a year because of this. I also tried talking to people in classes sometimes, but no one seemed to want to. The university was really clique-heavy and everyone seemed to plan out their schedule with their friends so that they would take them as a group, so I was always kind of the only person in my classes without a friend. A lot of people in the business school seemed like kind of douchey dudebros as well (I guess I'm unfairly stereotyping here though). I think in the last year of college I just kind of gave up and stopped talking to people completely. I feel kind of shitty about this since everyone I know who went to college and lived on campus at least made friends. 

Anyways I've been depressed for a while now and I think the sources of that are pretty obvious here. Any advice on where to go from here? What I should do, where I should go?"

I started off as an unpaid intern who was eventually hired. There's only 3 developers on the team including myself and one is an intern.

&amp;nbsp;

For the past 4-5 months, my paychecks have been late by at least a few days. The first time my paycheck was late, it was only by a few days. Then it was late by a week. Then 2 weeks. Now it's at the point where my boss is behind on 2 and a half MONTHS worth of payment.
&amp;nbsp;

His reasoning for being late is that he's trying to ""transfer money from [his] German bank account"" in order to pay us but the bank transfer is not going through. Every piece of information I could find on international transfers says they typically only take 2-5 business days so I'm incredibly skeptical about his 40 day late bank transfer.
&amp;nbsp;

Any time I text him about money, he takes around 1-2 days to respond and it's typically a very brief, uninformative response. I'll ask him ""Hey [boss' name], do you know when you'll be able to pay us?"" which typically results in him saying ""I'm not sure. I haven't received my transfer yet"". 
&amp;nbsp;

On Thursday, I had a meeting with him face to face. He seemed incredibly sympathetic about our situation and even said ""I promise, I'll get you your money tomorrow and pay you gentlemen. They're way past due and I need to get this off of my conscious"". On Friday morning, I asked what time we would be meeting. He informed me he would ""get back to me shortly with a time"". He never got back to me with a time. In fact, he did not return my calls or texts for the rest of the day. The next text I received from him regarding payment was this morning (Saturday) where he said ""I'm working on it"". I've asked him to elaborate on his financial situation because it's getting to the point where my friend and I are unable to pay our bills. My co-worker's credit score is dropping because he had to max out his credit card in order to pay his bills and is now unable to make payments due to a lack of income.

&amp;nbsp;

What can we do about this situation? If I seek legal action, can I sue for my paycheck AND the legal fees incurred due to the law suit? If not, the income acquired from the suit will be used towards legal fees so what's the point?
&amp;nbsp;

I'm becoming desperate and don't know what to do."

It's my first time posting here, and I've got a pretty difficult situation to boot, so forgive me if my post is a bit convoluted. I'd be happy to provide clarifications to anyone who asks. I'm just looking for honest, unbiased advice, as I'm really at a loss for what to do.

In high school I excelled academically, graduating at the top of my class, but I had severe behavior problems, partly due to untreated bipolar/depression and my own immaturity. I was accepted to a top-10 university, but wasn't able to attend due to a combination of not receiving enough financial aid and the aforementioned behavioral issues. I had to take a ""gap year"" and study at a community college, which I wasn't very happy about. However, it truly turned out to be the best year of my life. I realized that my goal of becoming a doctor simply wasn't right for me, and decided to pursue my passion for political science. I joined my school's Model United Nations team and won several competitions. I was able to conduct an independent research project my first semester and present it at a research conference in March. At only 19 I am being promoted to a managerial position at my job and I'm currently interviewing for several internships with congresspeople and major special interest groups in my area. 

The problem comes from what my parents want. They are pushing me to leave community college and attend a state university this upcoming fall. To keep them happy I submitted applications to the three best universities in the state (however, two of these applications were for Biology, my previous major.) I'd really rather stay at community college one more semester, where I can intern, take more classes related to my major, compete in Model UN, and complete applications for the best universities in political science (American U, Columbia, Georgetown, etc.) In the spring I would do an internship full-time, hopefully with the U.S. State Department (which I have already applied for.) I feel that I can really take advantage of all of the opportunities I have at the community college to propel me to a greater university - the best university in my state for political science doesn't even break top 30 nationally. Essentially I'd be ""starting over"" for no reason, as I wouldn't have the extracurriculars necessary to get me into a good university for the next year. The ranking of the university is especially important to me because one of the potential careers I am considering is in academia. My parents aren't willing to listen to me at all. My mom, who is usually very reasonable and not emotional at all, started screaming in the car and broke down crying when I brought this up.

My mind is 99% made up, but I'm still looking into other options to see what would be best for me. Meanwhile, my parents seem to be locked in that I will be leaving in the fall. They have gone as far as to tell me that if I don't go to university, they will send me back to my country (I'm from Puerto Rico). Moving out is pretty much out of the question - my job currently only pays me ~$100 a week, and my parents pay for my cell phone, car, insurance, and college expenses that my scholarship doesn't cover. Is there anything I can do?"

My university requires that students match fairly early for a co-op placement for the next term. I matched with Job A on June 14. Job A is a government lab technician position that is somewhat relevant to my engineering studies. I have not signed any contract with this employer but I have been officially ""matched"" with them. Two days ago I got an offer for Job B at a big company that is very relevant to my studies. I applied  and interviewed with Job B before accepting Job A but they were slow in getting back to me with an offer.

Because I found Job A through my university I am required to go through with the co-op placement because it looks bad on the university if I don't. Failure to go through with the placement will result in the co-op office giving me an ""F"" on my transcript which would affect my GPA. In rare occasions you may by able to ""un-match"" with an employer.

My questions is should I attempt to negotiate with the employer at Job A? Should I explain to him that I received an opportunity at a very prestigious company and ask if he could possibly un-match me? Do you think there is no harm in asking or would this result in an awkward situation if he refuses to un-match me? I will have finished my third year of university by the end of the summer so my time for getting good experience before I graduate is running out.

But in reality, I've struggled immensely with burnout and depression; I had to beg professors for extensions on assignments and finish them after the semester ended.

More to the point, I did no research during my Master's, no internships, and did not establish any positive relationships with my professors (even the one I am a TA for) due to my depression. Because the main reason I pursued my Master's was to do research, the first year of my Master's was a complete waste. With PhD admissions coming in a few months, my application looks weak without strong recommendation letters or research experience.

What should I do to improve my chances? My mental health has improved enough that I can do research with a professor in the upcoming fall semester, but there might not be enough time left to make a difference.

I joined my current company about 8 months ago and have managed to do a decent amount of work. Before joining the company i had an internship of 3 months. One of the reasons why i joined my current company was because its really hard to get a job with 0 years of experience and recruiters who used to call me after i had applied for a job would be shocked when i told them that i had 3 months of software development experience.    
Therefore i decided that i should get 1 year of experience on my resume and then start looking for jobs again. As you might have noted , i am about to complete 9 months in my current company and i will have 1 year of experience at the end of next month. When i joined i thought , i would move to another city with more opportunities after 1 year.     
Anyway , i am currently the joint least paid employee in my company and people with few months more experience than me get almost double of what i get. At the end of six months i asked for a small raise and was denied it. I pleaded and they asked me to write an email . I managed to write a very convincing email and hoped that they would offer me a raise.    
But it seems they have completely forgotten about it and did not even have the decency to tell me that they have read the email but unfortunately cannot offer me a raise. 
I have to handle multiple projects and more importantly have to manage some badly written code. The work pressure seems to be increasing and they have started scolding me repeatedly for not doing as well as they think i should.     
As far as skill is concerned , i am fantastic at interviews and pretty good at what i do. But my lack of professional experience seems to hurt me since most jobs require 2-3 years of experience. I am also pretty sure that to hire someone as good as me , they will have to pay almost (my current salary+1/3 of current salary) to the new guy.
So to the veterans of the community i ask for advice.  Which should option should i choose?    

* Negotiate again this month and if they offer me a decent raise stay.
* Negotiate and even if they don't offer me a raise , stay for one 
  year at the company.
* Let them know i am leaving and ask for a raise when they ask me not to.
* Leave the company at the end of next month after 9 months and 
a total of 1 year of experience.

6jfn67,13,2017-06-25,[Serious] Is this the most toxic university subreddit of all time?,firstyearmasterrace,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6jfn67/serious_is_this_the_most_toxic_university/,"I browse the other subreddits from time to time, including MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, etc. and all of them have mostly normal conversations about happenings on campus.  Almost none of them really concern themselves that much with CS careers on their respective forums.  

Now, maybe this school attracts a certain type of student who is unusually insecure.  Maybe it has a lack of stuff to do beyond muse the results of job applications (I actually think that's the primary symptom; there's really nothing to do at Waterloo), but I think a little bit of perspective and empathy is needed especially considering that we just recently had a couple suicides happen in the last year.  A good friend of mine TA's a lot of the classes here, and I can tell you that the struggles and surprising fragility of real life paint a different picture than what you're seeing here online.

I think back in the day when the university wasn't even on the radar of quality schools, and I don't say that disparagingly but you would be hard-pressed to put Waterloo in the same league as UofT or McGill (let alone some of the Ivy Leagues), there was more nuance in the discussions and definitely a bit more humility.  Now all of a sudden, everyone is the misunderstood genius sophomore programmer who is good at a SINGLE win condition (solving data structures and algorithms really quickly), but deserves the respect without having to earn it.

...and it will all go away if we collectively stop paying deference to people who have yet to make it in life.  I've been around the block, so I've seen all the patterns before.  The most decorated Stanford graduates with internship and full-time experiences at Facebook and Google, now looking at the cusp of 30 just struggling to get into a career rhythm after years of complete negligence with regards to their actual skill sets, not to mention total arrogance.  People who have never touched code until their mid-20's suddenly becoming domain experts in their field, bringing additional perspectives from their old careers and showing the humility; the tenacity to learn.  Every.  Single.  Day.  People who would never even sniff the grades to get into university, let alone Waterloo, now at the top of the hacker community (@marcan42).  

And it confuses me.  We're not MIT.  We're not Stanford.  We actually have no demonstrative proof that our IQ's are even that high (for the other schools, you have to score at least a 99th percentile on the SAT's)...and yet we're even less humble than they are?  That doesn't make any sense.  We have less of an endowment (metaphorically and literally) than York due to not having enough of a critical mass of super successful alumni (having a bunch of middle class alumni isn't game-changing), or the school being so dull that alumni actually fucking hate their alma mater.

So why again are we getting big?  We haven't even made it yet fam."
6jg0zo,2,2017-06-25,Don't know what to do,Elissa_of_Carthage,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/6jg0zo/dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hello, I'm a 17 year old student who has just finished her junior year (I think? Junior's the one before the last year of high school, right?) and doesn't have a clue about what she's going to do.

Next year, I'm supposed to choose what I will (most probably) do for the rest of my life. At this point, I've narrowed down my choices to two options: journalism+international relations or art restoration. I'll explain the reason why I feel these careers would fit me best, and their pros and cons:

**Journalism**

What I've loved doing all my life is writing. Reading and exploring worlds, coming up with stories, getting to create deep, rich characters... when I was little, I even won a couple of writing awards (but then again, I was like 10, so my writing was incredibly shitty, just not as shitty as everyone else's). Still, I don't think my writing is excellent. It's good, probably above average, but I'm not counting on it taking me places. I like being informed about the current situation the world is in and letting other people know, so that they're informed and know about the right sources. Being a journalist can be extremely rewarding if you make it big, and can attend important events and have contacts. International relations opens a whole world of possibilities, from being a correspondent to being able to work with the EU or similar entities. I'm also fluent in several languages, so that would help me secure a job (or at least, I hope so). You might also get to travel for free (more likely by studying international relations as well), and, travelling being one of the things I love most, this career path could be the best one for me. 

However, it also has many drawbacks. For starters, I don't like the classes taught for this particular career. While I understand why I have to take them, I can't help but feel annoyed at studying economics or politics. I've always been a very creative person, and the subjects I would look forward most are documentary making, radio, film directing, photography, investigative journalism and creative writing. Besides, if I were to be a journalist, I would like to be a proper one: the kind that researches and writes articles or appears on the news. But, to make it big as a journalist, you need to have previous contacts and know the right people, and I don't. However, the only places I could study this are in the capital city (in a private university, which would be incredibly expensive given the fact that I would need to pay for a living place too), which Í find very unlikely, or in my hometown, but the career choice here is not the exact same: it's international relations+communication. It centers more around the international relations part, and not communication, which would be my preferred choice. That would mean I would have to study even more politics and economics, and communication is not exactly journalism: it's more about cameras and editing. I love making videos of my school projects or voyages or even for fun sometimes, but I wouldn't like doing that for a living. I wouldn't like spending my time in a control room, I would like to be a real journalist. Yet, my hometown's university has a very good reputation. It has a great atmosphere, great professors and projects. It also has worldwide contact with other universities, specially in Rome (my dream destination), Great Britain, the US, and a new exchange program with South Korea. Many people who used to go to my school go there now, and everyone loves it. The international relations+communication students are taken to events all over the country for free to learn, and the internship programs are among the best media companies or the country. 

**Art restoration**

I've loved history since I was a kid. I used to say I wanted to be an archaeologist when people asked me what I would like to be when I grow up. Both my grandmothers love history, my father does as well, my aunt is a historian, and my mother has expressed her desire to be one when she was younger, although she doesn't seem very interested in art or history now. As I think I've mentioned previously in this post, I'm very creative, and have a deep, passionate love for ancient history, specifically Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, my city being of Roman past. I understand Latin and Ancient Greek and love mythology and art.

Despite that, I'm afraid I might not make a good art restorer. While I can paint well, I'm not an excellent painter. I can't paint like Michelangelo or Velazquez. I've never tried sculpting before, the closest I've been to that is making clay flowers when I was a kid. I think the main problem I have with painting and probably sculpting is proportions and symmetry, but then again, I don't really know for sure. While I love history and working on something like this, I don't think art restoring will make me go abroad or even leave my hometown aside from going to university, which is in a different city. My father has often told me that, whatever I decide to study, I have to make sure I'm the best in it so I can have a job. While I could make my way up the ranks by studying journalism (and have more job possibilities by studying international relations as well) and become a good one, I don't know if I could do the same thing with art restoration, as there are better painters than me and things like that. While I would enjoy this career path more, I don't think the possibilities of making it big are as broad as in journalism, especially with the economical crisis. This university is in another city, so I would need to pay for a living place, but it's a public university, so at least that's free. However, the atmosphere is certainly different, and I don't think I could travel as much as I could by studying here.

Then again, I don't want to leave my family here. My grandmothers are very old and I would never forgive myself if one of them died all of sudden and I were in another city. I don't want to leave my dog here but I wouldn't have time to take him out for a walk in a different city (probably), and he's been my anchor through depression and one of the main reasons I got out of it, but I can't take him away because my mother would have nothing to hold on to. I want to have him with me, as selfish as it sounds, but I can't do that to my mother. But, I don't want to stay here either. I don't have many friends here and would love a fresh start, though I don't know if it would be for the best to just try in a new city or stay here and expect to make new friend once in college. I would like living without my overbearing mother and getting to do things my way. While I feel like I would enjoy studying art restoration more than journalism, I don't know if it would be the wisest decision. There isn't as much competition between art restorers as there is between journalists, but there aren't as many chances of making it big in art restoration as there are in journalism.

So like most soon-to-be CS grads on this subreddit, I've made it my goal to get into companies like the Big 4, or Dropbox, Spotify, Yelp, Snapchat, etc after I graduate. 

My main reasons are the compensation and the resume boost, so that I can get interviews at other places easily after working there.

However, despite me trying to do internships, side projects, and interview prep to increase my chances, I feel like there's a pretty good chance that I will fail to get one of these jobs. I feel like my IQ is lower than the average person that gets a Big 4 job since I still struggle with a lot of Leetcode mediums despite devoting most of my time to practicing, and I have pretty bad performance anxiety, despite regularly doing mock interviews with people.

Therefore, I want to know whether there are companies out there that are maybe a bit easier to get into than a Big 4 or Unicorn but still pay well (close to six figures for new grads)

I just want to know if all the hard work and sacrifices I'm making might still amount to something even if I don't get a Big 4 or unicorn job. I pretty much spend all my free time outside of school/internships to work on side projects and interview prep to improve my chances, so I'd hate to put in all this effort and get an average-paying job like 60-70k in a medium-high COL area. (Yes, I know 60-70k is much better than nothing, but I'm giving up all the free time in my life for this)

I'm not asking for shortcuts or anything, I know only the best are deserving of that level of pay. I just want to know of my other options if I don't get a job at a top company and whether or not my efforts will ""go to waste"".

**TLDR: Devoting all my time to internships/side projects/interview prep in an attempt to get top tech job after graduation, but still think there's a good chance I'll fail to get one. Are there still companies that pay well (&gt;= 100k for new grads) that aren't big 4 or unicorn and easier to get into?**"

What to do?",justaregularintern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6jgqu6/was_verbally_promised_to_be_promoted_to_junior/,"Hi guys, I am in dire need for advice on how to proceed with my career and I figured this would be a nice place to start with, since I find it hard to talk with people about my current situation :(

Last summer just after my graduation I was interviewed and accepted as an intern in my current company, this being my first corporate position. During the internship I was lead to believe that candidates they like will have the option to continue as full time junior developers. Sure enough just before the end of the internship they gathered the remaining interns in a room and explained that they like us and would like for us to stay full time, but we must sign for the same intern position, only this time with a higher salary. I was a bit suspicious, but the money seemed reasonable, so I reluctantly agreed.

Fast forward to today, more than an year later and every time I talk with my upper management about being promoted to junior, I get some general bs about complications they have around arranging it and that they appreciate my work and would like for me to be just a little bit more patient.

We are working on a pretty specific technology stack that requires a bit of an ""initialization"" and I'd like to believe that I've been doing a decent job at it, since for the last 3-4 months I have been tasked, alongside my regular duties, with on-boarding newly recruited junior and mid-level developers. I can't help but feel like this is just... not fair, but at the same time the work I am doing is enjoyable and my colleagues are great...

**TL;DR - title**

Here are my questions:

**1)** Am I being unreasonable about trying to get promoted? My current salary is currently about 15-25% lower than what classmates of mine are getting for junior positions around town.

**2)** How do I proceed with asking for a promotion again (for the third time) without it being nagging and/or threatening?

**3)** The more I think about it, the more it feels like I should be applying for a junior position both to help my case for promotion or to actually find another place. How do I go about going to live interviews while working full time during week days?


Thanks to everyone who read this far and sorry if it seems like I am complaining, I just had to get this out of my system... I have mild social anxiety and it is really burdensome for me to talk to people about this, so I appreciate any advice that you guys might have for me! "

First, they use a programming language that is not as popular anymore, Coldfusion. They do use Angular JS for their front end, which is quite great. 

Second, I was very confused about what they were going to offer me until I actually received the offer. I was very clear from the very beginning that I wanted a full-time position, but with each interview they asked me, ""Are you here for the internship or the full-time position?"". I answered a full-time position each time. They then gave me an offer and wanted me to work as an intern until I graduated. I told them I couldn't do this because I had two jobs at the time, with commitments in both of them. 

Later on they did extend me an offer, but I denied them because of Coldfusion, I was waiting to hear back from other companies and I didn't want to make them wait longer than a week, and I wanted a full-time position first rather than an internship into the possibility of a full-time job (they said that me getting a full-time position wasn't a guarantee, just a possibility). 

Now it's been a month and I'm thinking of going back to them and asking if offer is still there. The internship I had was being part of a web development team for a company. My job consisted of maintaining a marketing website with a common stack (Drupal, Marketo, Salesforce) and although I loved my internship I really want to move away from it. Right now though, it seems like my best chances of landing a job would be getting a job that was exactly the same as my internship and the offer that I denied previously has been my only offer so far that is actually close to what I want (full-stack programmer, web development). 

I have some time to keep on looking but right now it's cutting close. I have rent and a car loan to pay soon, so time isn't really on my side anymore. 

Is it possible for me to go back and see if the offer is still on the table? "

I wanted to make a post because I'm a recent college graduate about to start working a standard 9-5 job, and I'm looking for some advice on how to settle into the routine. 

I've worked internships with a similar schedule in the past, and I found that after a few weeks, I would get upset about not having enough time out of work hours to do the things I wanted to do. I could sometimes pursue hobbies, meet up with friends, or get some much needed rest, but I generally never felt I had enough time to do all of those things regularly, so I would have to pick and choose. I could look forward to the end of each internship, but now I'm looking at a steady long-term job, and that's much more overwhelming. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to best deal with the transition into working, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance? I should note that I am not concerned about the job itself, since I will be in a comfortable environment doing work I want to do. I'm merely worried about my out-of-work life, and staying happy with that. 

Thank you!"
6jh46k,1,2017-06-25,Should I become a journalist or an art restorer?,Elissa_of_Carthage,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6jh46k/should_i_become_a_journalist_or_an_art_restorer/,"Hello, I'm a 17 year old student who has just finished her junior year (I think? Junior's the one before the last year of high school, right?) and doesn't have a clue about what she's going to do. Next year, I'm supposed to choose what I will (most probably) do for the rest of my life. At this point, I've narrowed down my choices to two options: journalism+international relations or art restoration. I'll explain the reason why I feel these careers would fit me best, and their pros and cons:

**Journalism**

What I've loved doing all my life is writing. Reading and exploring worlds, coming up with stories, getting to create deep, rich characters... when I was little, I even won a couple of writing awards (but then again, I was like 10, so my writing was incredibly shitty, just not as shitty as everyone else's). Still, I don't think my writing is excellent. It's good, probably above average, but I'm not counting on it taking me places. I like being informed about the current situation the world is in and letting other people know, so that they're informed and know about the right sources. Being a journalist can be extremely rewarding if you make it big, and can attend important events and have contacts. International relations opens a whole world of possibilities, from being a correspondent to being able to work with the EU or similar entities. I'm also fluent in several languages, so that would help me secure a job (or at least, I hope so). You might also get to travel for free (more likely by studying international relations as well), and, travelling being one of the things I love most, this career path could be the best one for me.

However, it also has many drawbacks. For starters, I don't like the classes taught for this particular career. While I understand why I have to take them, I can't help but feel annoyed at studying economics or politics. I've always been a very creative person, and the subjects I would look forward most are documentary making, radio, film directing, photography, investigative journalism and creative writing. Besides, if I were to be a journalist, I would like to be a proper one: the kind that researches and writes articles or appears on the news. But, to make it big as a journalist, you need to have previous contacts and know the right people, and I don't. However, the only places I could study this are in the capital city (in a private university, which would be incredibly expensive given the fact that I would need to pay for a living place too), which Í find very unlikely, or in my hometown, but the career choice here is not the exact same: it's international relations+communication. It centers more around the international relations part, and not communication, which would be my preferred choice. That would mean I would have to study even more politics and economics, and communication is not exactly journalism: it's more about cameras and editing. I love making videos of my school projects or voyages or even for fun sometimes, but I wouldn't like doing that for a living. I wouldn't like spending my time in a control room, I would like to be a real journalist. Yet, my hometown's university has a very good reputation. It has a great atmosphere, great professors and projects. It also has worldwide contact with other universities, specially in Rome (my dream destination), Great Britain, the US, and a new exchange program with South Korea. Many people who used to go to my school go there now, and everyone loves it. The international relations+communication students are taken to events all over the country for free to learn, and the internship programs are among the best media companies or the country.

**Art restoration**

I've loved history since I was a kid. I used to say I wanted to be an archaeologist when people asked me what I would like to be when I grow up. Both my grandmothers love history, my father does as well, my aunt is a historian, and my mother has expressed her desire to be one when she was younger, although she doesn't seem very interested in art or history now. As I think I've mentioned previously in this post, I'm very creative, and have a deep, passionate love for ancient history, specifically Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, my city being of Roman past. I understand Latin and Ancient Greek and love mythology and art.

Despite that, I'm afraid I might not make a good art restorer. While I can paint well, I'm not an excellent painter. I can't paint like Michelangelo or Velazquez. I've never tried sculpting before, the closest I've been to that is making clay flowers when I was a kid. I think the main problem I have with painting and probably sculpting is proportions and symmetry, but then again, I don't really know for sure. While I love history and working on something like this, I don't think art restoring will make me go abroad or even leave my hometown aside from going to university, which is in a different city. My father has often told me that, whatever I decide to study, I have to make sure I'm the best in it so I can have a job. While I could make my way up the ranks by studying journalism (and have more job possibilities by studying international relations as well) and become a good one, I don't know if I could do the same thing with art restoration, as there are better painters than me and things like that. While I would enjoy this career path more, I don't think the possibilities of making it big are as broad as in journalism, especially with the economical crisis. This university is in another city, so I would need to pay for a living place, but it's a public university, so at least that's free. However, the atmosphere is certainly different, and I don't think I could travel as much as I could by studying here.

Then again, I don't want to leave my family here. My grandmothers are very old and I would never forgive myself if one of them died all of sudden and I were in another city. I don't want to leave my dog here but I wouldn't have time to take him out for a walk in a different city (probably), and he's been my anchor through depression and one of the main reasons I got out of it, but I can't take him away because my mother would have nothing to hold on to. I want to have him with me, as selfish as it sounds, but I can't do that to my mother. But, I don't want to stay here either. I don't have many friends here and would love a fresh start, though I don't know if it would be for the best to just try in a new city or stay here and expect to make new friend once in college. I would like living without my overbearing mother and getting to do things my way. While I feel like I would enjoy studying art restoration more than journalism, I don't know if it would be the wisest decision. There isn't as much competition between art restorers as there is between journalists, but there aren't as many chances of making it big in art restoration as there are in journalism.

What do you think I should do?"

So I graduated from a biomedical science degree, did research in molecular genetics for a year, decided i don't want to continue down that path, and am now moving into CS.

My options for this move are:
1.) Second BS in computer science (2.5-3 years)
2.) Masters in Information Technology in my uni (1 year). 

Option 2 is advertised as an 'industry-based Masters' (i.e. no research thesis) geared for those w/ non-IT backgrounds. It starts off with a 12-week coding bootcamp where object-oriented programming in Java and full-stack web-development is taught. Then, it's a year of doing Masters' level coursework in computer science (5 subjects) and business (3 subjects) along with a guaranteed industry internship for 10 weeks. Sticking by the 'industry-based' label, there are also lots of career-development courses offered throughout the programme to students, networking with industry, and talks given by industry people to give us an idea of what kind of jobs are out there.

I'm struggling to decide which option to pursue.

I'm interested in getting a software dev job after graduating. But I am also interested in other CS fields like Artificial intelligence (ML) and bioinformatics, and may possibly pursue these fields in the future.

I will do a lot of self-teaching regardless. I am starting now, teaching myself python (i'm an absolute newbie to programming) and doing online courses from edX and coursera. Most job adverts in NZ (where I'm from) and Australia seem to not mind either. Talking to recruiters at Career fairs, what I got is that the CS qualification doesn't matter as much as having proof that you can do the job.

What are your honest thoughts? Any insights would be appreciated. Cheers.

6jhbkl,2,2017-06-25,I feel extremely lost in what was supposed to be a year of progress...,Aguila909,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6jhbkl/i_feel_extremely_lost_in_what_was_supposed_to_be/,"Last year at the end of July, I was kicked out of my suburban home due to multiple disagreements with my mother. Effectively making me homeless, I transitioned towards the city of Chicago where many of my friends reside and ended up receiving lots of help for the two months I was without shelter. I was then offered to come back home with a grace period of being able to save up to move out the following year (September—December of '16). But slowly things took a turn for the worst as my mother started to show her manipulative side again. One of my partners (polyamorous) offered me to stay at their place until the summer enabling me to get my feet on the ground and stay away from the unhealthy situation back home—or so that was the plan...

During the first month and a half of this year I fell ill under a horrible case of mono. Unbeknownst to me at the time, our insurance was under change and the whole ER visit was unpaid for. February was the month I finally settled into my partner's place. I'm fairly stubborn and asking/being offered help is something I consider as defeat, so it took a bit of adjustment. My other partner found me a pretty well off job at a bank but I decided to put it off for a while due to coming from another fairly conservative job and not wanting to be within that environment anymore. (Something I'm regretting fairly hard right now...) The look for jobs was underway for a while, interviews being planned but none taken. I was able to get an internship at a fairly popular club but is unpaid. This was around April. 

Due to the lack of progress in terms of being financially stable, the partner I'm currently residing with has made the deadline to move out by the end of August as it is completely unfair to the other two roommates, I move I understand. 

Something that been affecting me since the beginning of this month (June) has been my panic disorder coming back full swing. With a total of three panic attacks happening—all very violent. The first happening at the beginning of the month sending me to the ER, the other two having been this week. All have been related to stress regarding money (mainly) and my relationships, romantic and otherwise. 

I've been thinking of moving back home but the backlash and belittlement from my mother would drive me insane. Not to mention the emotional and mental abuse that would follow. Finding a job would be a little easier but would rely on my mother or a friend to drive since I don't know how (hence the move to Chicago). The sense of isolation would also be greater because of that. 

Staying within the city is also proving to be a little harmful at the moment since both my partners seem to be a source of stress. Or anything at this point due to a developing case of agoraphobia. But also staying means I have easier access to walk where I need to be, and with money, be able to use public transport again. Finding a job though seems to be impossible. 

I'm currently out of money and have been for the past two and a half months. I know I've been diagnosed with passive suicidal ideation last year. But lately the thoughts of doing it have been flooding my mind. Whether it be via CTA (subway) or hanging has been a constant; it's been disgusting me. Just thinking of the images of it and what my friends and partners would go through haunts me. But it also brings me a sense of peace that all my problems would go away. Especially in a time of dire hopelessness and multiple debts (one that will soon eat my credit). 

I've been looking into local transitional homes or something to see if I could try and get another fresh start, but, in a world like this, money is a major ruling factor and it's something I've been without for a long while. This was supposed to be a year of progress, not a slope downwards. I can't figure out what to do anymore and the thoughts of doing it just seem more plausible at the moment (which I know from past experiences, is never the case). 

I just feel so isolated and lost and unsure what will hurt or help me—or what will hurt others in the process if I continue this path. 

I'm not really sure what I'm saying any longer—but typically rambles like these tend to help...figured this would be a place to do that considering the subject matter and how I'm feeling at the moment. "

He's really cool and we all like him a lot, but had no experience coming in. His job is primarily being an image monkey. We get requests for new computers and he images them and sends them out. He's be going above and beyond the initial responsibilities and has even helped us with some Windows 10 upgrades when we get backed up in the ticket queue.

A few weeks ago I asked him to upgrade a laptop for a sales guy. Not paying attention, he instead did a clean install and wiped all the data. As with many on our sales team, they rarely back up any data or use the means we have in place to secure it, like One Drive.

I informed the sales guy about what happened, he was really cool about it and said he didn't have any data on the hard drive as he used One Drive. Excellent, but I didn't tell the intern this.

Instead I set up a prank, a fun prank to help him remember to be more vigilant about upgrading computers and backing up data. 

I had the intern call the boss who was in on it. The boss told the intern that this sales guy had a huge contract he was working on for a big client and it was the only copy he had. He told the intern to go to the admin team to see about running a program to restore files. He went to the admin team who laid it on heavy. 

""Why didn't you just do an upgrade?""

""You didn't back up his data first?""

""Man that sucks, we probably can't recover it but we can try.""

At this point I started to feel bad for the kid, he looked really defeated. In our software repository I wrote a script and filled a folder with some fake files. The script did a simple read out letting him know we pranked him. He ran the script and I watched him stare at the screen as his brain processed the words, slowly. He dropped his head and started laughing. 

Needless to say, I don't think he'll make the same mistake again. "

This current summer and last summer, I have had internships at company A in city A. I like it here a fair amount, I’m doing semi-useful work (not just fetching coffee), and I’m getting paid fairly well. It is a large company.


They will almost certainly offer me a chance to come back next summer, and I’ve just been thinking about whether it would be better for me to take a return offer or to try to get an internship somewhere else and get more variety. I am interested in working at company A after graduation, especially if I can get into their rotational program.


If I decide to try to go somewhere else, I would like to try to get an internship in city B, a large city where I go to college. I would much prefer living in city B in the apartment I already will have a lease over the summer.


Advantages of working at company A next summer: Familiarity with how things work here, would better my chances of getting a job here after college, probably better pay. I would already have a offer by the end of this summer.


Advantages of living in city A next summer: No rent or food costs (living with parents and would try to sublease my apartment in city B for the summer), familiarity with the city &amp; bus system


Advantages of living in city B next summer: I much prefer being in city B in my apartment to being in city A living with my parents. I also wouldn’t have to mess with the hassle of trying to sublease my apartment cause I’d be living in it.


Advantages of working at hypothetical company B next summer: Get a greater variety of experience with different companies.


This is the last summer before I graduate. I would definitely like to try someplace new &amp; would definitely prefer to live in city B, but I’m also concerned about making myself as likely as possible to be able to get a job post-college.

 
Anyways, anyone who read this far let me know what you think.

I have found part time work with two catering companies, and believe this should suffice in terms of making a living while I move onto a graduate job or even an internship.

However, all of these pressures from back home and the uncertainty of the future is taking its toll on me, and I have broken down several times due to the emotional guilt I feel from my brother. My family is dysfunctional and he claims that when I move back home it calms everything down. If you could give me any advice on this situation it would be great, as I am currently at a loss.

tl;dr Did not meet masters criteria at my university, currently considering internships, signed housing contract but part of my family is pressuring me to return home (dysfunctional family) while other parts encourage me to stay. Not sure as to what to do, much emotional guilt and upset, affecting my mental health.

6jn4hw,1,2017-06-26,"27/M/Dropout/LivesWithParents/Can't decide between Entrepreneur or STEM degree. Warning: long life story, no tl;dr.",AmazingAntitheist,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6jn4hw/27mdropoutliveswithparentscant_decide_between/,"As a child, I loved all things scientific; airplanes, weather, archeology, space, etc. I can even recall contemplating a perpetual motion fountain, and windmill, with impossible physics. However, I wasn't a prodigy, so most of my fascination consisted of watching pictures and reading superficial scientific books for kids. I even remember my first-grade teacher making fun of me because I was one of the slowest at arithmetic; so at 7 years old, my mathematical anxiety for mental arithmetic began. 

That year I passed below average, but until I was 12, my all-around grades improved. I began to love studying. Contrarily to my first-grade teacher, my sixth-grade teacher told me I should study Latin. Latin was considered one of the hardest middle school paths, reserved for the philomaths; the nerds. I can not recall why I did not walk that path then and there, but I'm quite confident that the choice was made for me; for the reason being: too hard. Which might have been accurate then. 

Junior high indeed proved to be difficult. As I said, I am not a prodigy, so I had to learn a lot. That wasn't a problem though, since I still loved getting up at 6 AM to study biology for example, which I mostly passed narrowly. Also, math and other subjects consisted of mere rote learning, not understanding. I can even remember studying for my first history test. It consisted of one page we had to learn back and forth. I took that literally and tried to memorize it back and forth. I think I scored a 9/15, after studying a whole day. My friend, read it for an hour, while voice chatting with me, and scored a 14. I was thirteen at the time. My mediocre grades would have bothered me a few years before, but I was more and more being drawn into games and pubescent hormones. 

For high school I was advised to step down the ladder once more. I took the more technical route instead of the academic one. My grades skyrocketed and I even was the best of class once. Everything was much easier suddenly. I remember going to my math teacher, asking if it was possible to step up the ladder again because the math was too easy. Nothing came of it, and I became more and more lazy, spending an increasing amount of time gaming. 

Starting from the middle of freshman year I was bullied for the next year and a half, which strengthened my MMORPGs avatars even further. Throughout high school there were only a couple of classes I liked: natural sciences, math, P.E, English and geography. Other classes were thing like bookkeeping, finance, French, etc. The latter ones made me despise school altogether. My head was into first person shooters and MMORPGs instead. Which I don't regret by the way, I experienced wonderful times playing those. Around age seventeen I came into contact with my first beer. This helped me fix my left over paranoia from being bullied. I could talk to girls again, and I grew my personality in ways I otherwise wouldn't have. But by this time, I had totally forgotten any notion of science. At the age of eighteen, I had no idea what to pick for higher education. The only guidance we got was the task of writing down a top 3 list of thing you want to do. I think my list consisted of: P.E. teacher, the army, and something else.

Since there was no job certainty as a P.E., I settled for A1 nursing school. I liked anatomy, and my mother was a nurse also at the time. Go figure, I thought it would be a good fit. Initially my mother said I couldn't handle A1, which is more theoretical compared to A2, the course my mother followed. This choice was one of the first ones I made for myself, opposing the advice of adults. This sounds stupid, but up until the age of 21 I though adults were always correct and much wiser than kids. I couldn't have been more wrong.

To the surprise of my mother, I passed the first year of nursery just fine. In hindsight I know my study method was horrid. It wasn't even a method, but merely reading things over and over again. Anyway, good grades were fun, but I totally hated the internships, which means I hated the job. School said: “Just stick with it, it will get better next year. Then you can work at an emergency room or surgery in the third year.” So I stuck with it, to no avail. I thoroughly hated getting up in the morning, and kept counting down the time. I dropped out in the second year. Hastily I did some odd jobs, hated those even more, so I enrolled back in on the grounds of nursery beating the alternatives. In the third year I started to drink more and more at parties, sometimes even arrived hung over in class or internships after 3 hours of sleep. One time I even forgot what I ate for lunch when a colleague asked what I ate an hour before. It was a downward spiral, and ended up being depressed during the last three months of the total three years nursing school. I even passed my thesis, but dropped out after I had a breakdown while receiving a horribly negative review of my last internship. Tears starting poring and admitted I wanted the train to derail each morning when going to work. I fucking hated everything. The only good memories I can recall of those days were when I watched Scrubs. I admired doctors a lot, but why oh why couldn't I be one.

Again, hastily I had to choose something. A job, or study. I loved games and I once had aspirations to be a programmer. So I chose game development. The first year was one of the best years in my life. I learned to draw, I learned programming, I learned math, I learned 3D modeling, I learned that criticism is a good thing and all first creations suck, but most importantly I met my first girlfriend with which I basically lived together for 5 months in her small room. Life was awesome. A lot of hard work and sleepless nights, a lot of love, and an occasional party. Sadly, she had to go back to her country as she was an erasmus student, and we chose to part ways. She told me to study in her country, I contemplated, but I was too immature back then, so I didn't do it. 

The second year of game development I chose the programming major. I soon came to realize my own ineptitude and holes in math. On top of that, my laptop crashed and couldn't follow anything anymore. This was also a time I believed in a fixed mindset. Basically the idea that if I'm not able to understand something quickly, I'm too stupid and I will never understand. Not long after that I dropped out of the programming classes and aced the level design and 3D modeling classes instead. The following year I switched majors to game graphics. More modeling and drawing, no programming. By this time I was 24. I started to miss my friends, and began to drink more with them. That year I sporadically enrolled a certified lifeguard course and firefighter school in my spare time. I quit game development and successfully passed the latter courses. I loved it because these were two decisions I made out of my own volition without any pressure. I gained a lot of confidence doing that. I was used to hearing my mother say I couldn't handle this or that, so by doing this I proved to myself I could do the things I want to do.

I worked as a lifeguard for 1.5 years and saved up a decent amount of money. I quit drinking for the same amount of time. During these years I was introduced to science again through Tesla and SpaceX. I also rediscovered reading after approximately 10 years. I learned about Khan Academy and the growth mindset; the notion that you can change your brain. A big discovery was realizing how detrimental my study methods were. Nearly everything I did was scientifically proven to be useless. (e.g. re-reading and extensively using markers). Anyway, I decided to enroll in three courses in university to get a feel for its difficulty. I took linear algebra, statistics and philosophy. I failed the first two and nicely passed philosophy. I learned that I had many holes in my mathematical toolbox. Everything I previously knew of math was pure memorization, not understanding. So I bought math textbooks and started to re-learn from the ground up. During this time up until now I did not work or go to school. It has been like a sabbatical for 1 year to learn stuff. I'm also attending voluntary philosophy cafés, scientific lectures, co-founded a small non-profit, took up photography and chess. Generally, I'm trying to improve every day. Besides math I also got into web development, and discovered cryptocurrency. The latter is my theoretical source of income, which will hopefully allow me to move out of my parents house in a year or two. I understand many will find it pathetic that I still live with my parents, but I refuse to pay a mortgage while doing a job I hate. 

I also realize I'm spoiled. If my parents didn't let me stay at their place, I wouldn't be able to do all of this. But to be brutally honest, I don't really care because I mostly despise them, especially my mother, for never supporting me and always instilling self-doubt. It's not their fault because that's how they were raised, still. 

I'm getting to the end of my overly long rant. Bit by bit I'm resuscitating my old fascination for science and technology. Ironically or moronically, because I'm confident I can do the things I put my mind to, I'm unsure whether to get into a STEM-field in university or to further self-study web development on my own, and finish a project—in other words, be my own boss. Over the years I've come to realize I love creating things, and have lot's of difficulty working for someone else. There’s just so many awesome things to do, and so many unsolved problems in this world; it’s hard to choose with so many ideas in my mind. My gut tells me I should go to university because I need to level up my problem solving skills, which will help me with everything I do in life. On the other hand I want to finish my project, which could end up possibly, but unlikely, profitable, while polishing my programming skills. 

Bravo to anyone who read this."
6jny03,4,2017-06-26,Had an interview two Fridays ago and it went well. Interviewer said I would receive a call by early the following week. It has now been 10 days with no call.,mastertatto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6jny03/had_an_interview_two_fridays_ago_and_it_went_well/,"TL;DR - Wondering if I should call for the second time or just say ""fuck it"" and move on.


I had my first interview for an internship 10 days ago. After it seemingly went pretty well, my interviewer let me know that they would call me either by that same afternoon or early next week (ambiguous, but figured it meant by Tuesday, no later). Come Wednesday afternoon having not receiving a call, I decided to call the front desk myself and ask for the interviewer. I was on hold for a minute before she informed me that he was in a meeting, so she had me leave my name and number so that he could call back. As of today, I still have not received a call. I'm frustrated at the unprofessionalism of this interviewer and admittedly less interested in working there now for this reason, but at the same time, landing this internship could help out my resume a lot and even bring in a bit more money for my family. I'm also concerned that calling again might lower my chances to land the position. Pretty back-and-forth on it overall. Any thoughts?


Edit: After calling the front desk again, I was immediately told that he was in a meeting (again) and asked for my name and number (again). I also told them that this is exactly what happened last week when I called and the lady told me she wasn't there last week and assured me he'd get my message. That was 2 1/2 hours ago and still no call back. This guy seems to be in a lot of ""meetings"". Probably going to end up skipping out on this company. "

My cumulative GPA is 2.9(including my gen ed and CS courses), my computer science GPA is a 3.5.

However, I've only completed two computer science courses(ill be taking two more next semester). Is calculus included in my comp-sci GPA? I earned C's in both calc 1 and calc 2, therefore it would drop my CS GPA to 2.5.

I'm a junior credit wise, but a sophomore in the computer science program because i changed majors my second year at the university. I will graduate on time oddly enough, just these last few semesters will be stocked full of CS classes. 

I also was thinking of adding a math minor, since my school only requires me to take up to calc 2 and linear algebra isn't a requirement for my major either. But, that will add 12ish more credits that are more demanding than others(calc has never been my strong suit). If I drop the math minor and focus on raising my GPA that might be more helpful for future job prospects. If I can get a 4.0 these next two semesters(which is very doable because I will be finishing up my elective and non-cs requirements such as stats, English, and some history courses + some CS courses) my GPA will be boosted to 3.22.

tldr
Don't know which gpa to put on my resume. My comp sci gpa is a 3.5 and my total gpa is a 2.9. But i've only taken 2 computer science courses so far(im a junior but switched majors, can still graduate on time). Don't want to come off as sleazy if they compare my comp sci gpa to my total gpa. 

Should I add a math minor but risk not increasing my gpa, or drop the math minor and focus primarily on raising my gpa these last few semesters?"

Luckily enough, my mom was in China when I came back from college and I told my dad upfront that I'm keeping the computer in my room. My dad was chill about it and that was that.

Unfortunately, my mom has always had some lack of trust when I keep my desktop in my room. She thinks that I'll be in my room all day if I were to keep it in there which isn't true at all. I'm currently taking classes and interning at the same time. I busted my ass off this school year to get some sort of internship after my freshman year. So I was expecting my mom to agree to keep it in my room. 

Nope. After about a week, she randomly told me that my computer can't be in my room anymore. My mom has always been stubborn. She could make you trade your dollar for someone's penny if she wanted to. No matter how reasonable I was, she said no. I asked why, and she just responds with ""no reason. It has to go.""

I get frustrated and at this point pissed off since it was so random. She also gave me a lot of unnecessary shit that day that I didn't do but that's irrelevant. I snap and explain that she still treats me like a little baby. Also said that she had issues. Pretty bad I know, but I had an exam the next day and a lot of things were stressing me out. I just snapped.

I don't know what to do at this point. She acted normal the next day and before my exam, she said that the computer is leaving my room after my final exam. Is there any way for me to reason with her at all?

I have a good feeling she doesn't trust me since I'll just be playing video games all day. That isn't true. Both my parents despise video games and think that it's a huge bane to society. They won't understand no matter how I explained it (Dad kicked me one time when I tried to explain how a lot of my friends who are smart enjoy playing since it's also a social thing). My dad loosened up, but my mom hasn't. It frustrates me.

Any suggestions would be nice. This is my computer but they don't are about that"

6jok5u,34,2017-06-26,How I got an engineering job at Coca-Cola with a low (2.3) GPA...,issaunicorn_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6jok5u/how_i_got_an_engineering_job_at_cocacola_with_a/,"I've been itching to share this story because I think it might help someone who's struggling to see the point in life with a low GPA. I struggled so hard in college, and despite my atrocious gpa, I was still able to secure a job with coca -cola before graduation! I know it sounds too good to be true (trust me, it took a long time for me to believe it too), but contrary to popular belief, it is possible to land an engineering job with a fortune 500 company even with a terrible GPA. Here are the things I did that helped me:

1) If you attend a good university (I went to Georgia Tech), you're still in luck - this always plays to you advantage. Not to say that sub-par universities don't count, but it usually helps if the company you're interested in has a good relationship with your university


2) LEAVE YOUR GPA OFF YOUR RESUME!!! I can't stress this enough! Your resume is supposed to be a display of your good attributes. A lot of people have differing opinions on this subject matter, but I think if it doesn't help your image, it shouldn't be on your resume. And don't lie about your GPA either. Because if you get caught lying, it's never pretty. Even though a lot of entry-level jobs do have a gpa requirement, the vast majority of full-time jobs don't. I left my gpa off because I was banking on the possibility that no one would ask for it. And no one did, even after 3 rounds of interviewing.


3) Work experience is very essential. I had a couple of internships as well as research experience before I graduated. I would suggest that if you need to spend an extra year in college just to gain internship experience, it will go a long way. Because a low gpa is already bad enough, but if you have impressive internship experience that is relevant to the job you're applying for, they won't even care what your gpa is. And stop trying to land internships with big companies. They usually have gpa requirements for interns. Just focus on smaller companies that are likely to give you a job. When it comes to interning, it doesn't matter what company you work for. Just get the damn experience. It goes a long way.


4)Don't be scared to apply. I fell victim to this mentality, because every article I read online basically said that I was out of luck because my gpa was below a 3.0. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't get a job at a big company. You might have lower odds, but they are still odds. If you see a job opening, it never hurts to apply. 


5) Career fairs are pretty much a waste of time because you're competing with people who have ridiculous gpa's. Also, recruiters at career fairs only care about gpa, so if you're below a certain number, your resume will be in the trash the moment you drop it off. I got my job through online applications. A lot of big companies pay online recruiting agencies to find people for them, and these recruiters are more concerned about finding people who fit the description, more so than weeding out people solely based on gpa. 


6)Exude confidence at the interview (if you make it this far). In my case, the interview was very much behavioral. The interviewers were more interested in my personality than my skills. Any skill can be learned, but you must be able to communicate to the interviewer that you are the right person for the job without coming off as desperate. 


7) Educate yourself about the company. There's nothing more irritating to a hiring manager than a person who doesn't know anything about the company/position he or she is interviewing for. Don't go cramming irrelevant information though. Familiarize yourself with the company's mission and vision. Be aware of any press releases that the company has been mentioned in recently.

I know it's a lot, but these are the things I did and I was able to get a great job with an even greater company. Good luck!

I want part time, company would prefer full time.",Aazadan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6jp1if/got_my_offer_for_post_internship_i_want_part_time/,"So long story short, my current company really likes me, and will essentially bend over backwards to keep me.  They understand that I would like to finish school, and would be willing to let me work part time + remote to do that while attending class.  But, they see this as a pretty major concession and want me to stay at my current rate.  
  
Alternatively, they're willing to extend me a full time offer (which given the rest of my time commitments means dropping out of school) at any reasonable salary I want (including a bit above the salary band for the position).  
  
It means giving up a lot of money, but I want to finish school.  However, I have a lot of negotiating leverage here as I've been operating well outside the scope of a normal intern for the company (only programmer, built entire code base, etc... their project basically relies on me 100%), the intern title is more in name only, I'm closer to a contractor that they want full time.  How do I use this to negotiate a better salary?  I lowballed myself on my initial rate and I want to make up for that.  Can I just point out my value and say I should be paid higher?  At the same time though, part time basically means our projects will now progress at half speed, and I can see where the company is coming from, that that's a huge concession on their part already."

6jpdgc,1,2017-06-26,(Indiana) Collecting rent money from someone who was never on our lease,EpicLeaps,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6jpdgc/indiana_collecting_rent_money_from_someone_who/,"Hello redditors,

I have an issue I would like to take up in small claims court, but I wanted to make sure I had a sufficient case to claim rent from someone I was living with that is now refusing to pay.

Last year, two friends and I signed a year long lease for an off-campus student house (I am in college). 

Before the initial first rental date, one of my future roommates, from out of state, unexpectedly could not return to the school I was attending, so we were forced to find a third roommate last minute. Luckily one of my mutual friends knew someone who would agree to move in with us, I'll call him roommate C. My first thought was to get a new lease drafted with roommate C's name on it. When I called the company associated with the property, they told me it wasn't necessary to draft up a new lease, and that all they cared about was getting their money each month. Knowing that it was a year long lease, I informed roommate C that he would be paying for rent over the summer months (plus utilities) as well, even when all of us would return home for the summer and not be living in the house.

Anyways, fast forward half way through the year, and roommate C decides to tell us last minute that he is doing a co-op program and that he will be leaving to a different state after winter break, but he says that he has a friend that will rent from us for the remaining months. I'll call him roommate D.

I let roommate C know to inform roommate D that he would be paying over the summer months as well. To which roommate C said roommate D understood. To make things even more clear, I directly stated to roommate D through text that he would be liable paying his rent over the summer months as well, and could split those months with roommate C, since they both had lived in the house over the course of the year and were equally responsible.

Fast forward to May, all of us were scheduled to move out the first week of the month to fly home to family. I asked roommate D for May's rent, since it is payed on the first of every month. He tells me he is short on funds, and I agreed to hold off on making him pay the rent, but I told him I wanted him to give me a check for the remaining months and I would cash it when he received the funds to do so. He refused and told me he would pay me on venmo (like we had been doing it) when he got paid his first week at his internship. 

Fast forward two months and multiple attempts to collect his payment. He keeps claiming that although he has been paid, he has current rent and other expenses and cannot afford to pay the rent for the last month he stayed in our house, or the remainder of the summer. He also told me that he doesn't see why he would have to pay for May or the remaining months over the summer, since he wasn't staying in the house over the summer. I made it very clear to him previously that he would be paying for these months, but he seemed oblivious. At this point I'm starting to question whether he'll ever have the money to do so, and I'm scared because he was never on the lease and I feel like he may not be legally bound to do so.

Also, something that may be important. In March, we had to make a double rent payment to the company we were renting from for March and the last month July, which roommate D did indeed pay.

I have text message records of all our conversations, and clear payment records for the time he stayed in our house. I can easily prove that he did in fact live with us and was paying us rent. Would my case for collecting the remaining money hold up in small claims court?

Thanks for any answers!

Basically I will be doing an involved project in VHDL for my internship, where I will take a component that needs to be integrated with a payload (satellite) and code, in VHDL, the controller for that component, the interface for that controller and the rest of the payload, and the (apparently very in-depth) test bench in order to prove the controller behaves like the datasheet specifies.

My interests in EE are primarily embedded systems / signal processing (robotics, ML, dsp). I'm wondering if this project will help / hurt my chances of getting a job more closer to my interests (namely robotics), or if it would be worth trying (and likely failing) to get a different project. My manager assures me this is the most 'complete' type of project, where I develop end to end and it will be used in the final product, and I'm inclined to believe him

Thinking about trying to break into the information management field, also cross-taking a graduate level GIS class with the geography department in the fall. Also taking advanced GIS in the spring.

Currently kicking around the museum that is ran by the History department, I'm more or less their ""tech person"". I've been put in charge of creating some sort of social media and digital presence for them and making a promo video. In the fall I have an internship at the same location where I will be exclusively converting old film strips into a digital format for preservation purposes.

I don't know any programming languages. Don't want to, I took a programming class in high-school and it bored me to tears. Also, I totally blow at math. I peaked at Algebra 1, I'm a history major for a reason.

Once a new professor arrives in the fall, I will be working with them 20 hours a week doing some sort of research project. Likely involving Czech Jews. I'm quite honored to be doing this, as it was a promotion (with a pay praise, still poverty level though!) from my old position this last year and I was the only person awarded the role in the entire department.

I have a year of substitute teaching experience, but that isn't the direction I want my career to go in.

I also run a successful Amazon store, where I sell vintage Video/Board games. It's essentially an online pawnshop I run out of my apartment. Only been been doing that since early March, but it's been rather successful, funds itself and provides a nice side income. Don't really know how much I've netted so far, but the number in my bank account keeps going up at a good rate. So I must be doing something right. i do around 30-35 sales a month, but it's steady. Also, I only source locally and my margins are amazing, 2000-5000%+. Admittedly, I pass on a fair bit of stuff that I don't consider worth my time cause the margins are only 20-100%. It's a space/time issue. I try to keep about 120-150 active listings, so I'm selling about 20-25% of my inventory every month.

Realistically in terms of Amazon stores, i'm pretty small potatoes. But i'm successful small potatoes.

The longer I do the Amazon store thing, the more it's beginning to take on the legs of a real business. I've developed a relationship with a source, I bulk buy supplies, I've developed a sense for what does and doesn't sell, washed my hands of ""clearance inventory"" a couple times, dealt with returns/customer service issues...etc.

The Amazon store isn't something I'm dead-set on running forever, I don't want to do it as my sole job and I don't need two full time jobs, which this is becoming. Once I find a good post-college job, I'll likely slowly wind down my Amazon store.

I feel like running my Amazon store is giving/has given me some marketable skills, but I haven't entirely figured out what those are yet. Or how to ""sell"" them.

Have one year left, don't want to stay in Ohio if I can help it. Don't really care where I end up as long as it's a large coastal city in a warm climate.

I am so tired of Ohio weather.

My definition of ""Large"" might be a bit different than everyone else, cause I grew up in a tiny, isolated, rural community in Ohio. I'd say anywhere with a city of 70-80k+ and a larger metro region. But really, the larger the better. I just don't like small town life, I hate not being able to do things without everyone knowing about it.

I want to live somewhere with culture and entertainment options. Things I would look for in a city:

Local music/arts/culture talent, the city i'm in right now has a lack of national talent that comes through, but is drowning in local talent. I enjoy going to their performances/shows.

Hiking/Cycling options. I like doing outdoorsy things. Which is why I'd like a coastal city (swimming!).

Good nightlife options."

So my programming skills are a bit rusty. Before then, I had internships at other companies working in a variety of things like C#, ASP.net, Javascript/jQuery and some website design. My contract was terminated in a recent wave of layoffs and now I'm looking for a new job which I would prefer not to be SCADA-related, and more programming oriented. It feels like the job at the oil company was bad for my career since it didn't develop my programming skills and I now I'm looking for entry level jobs and competing with new grads with pretty much the same skillset as me. Also, sadly I think it's pretty much guaranteed my salary will see a huge drop at any new place I go to.

I'm rebuilding my skillset now and working on some pet projects to add to my portfolio, I think I wouldn't mind doing frontend and backend work. Any advice from others who may have had their skills in ""limbo""? Should I focus my skills on any certain technologies?"

6jr0zd,4,2017-06-27,How to advance my experience in computer vision?,Carpetfizz,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/6jr0zd/how_to_advance_my_experience_in_computer_vision/,"Hello,

I realized I'm really interested in computer vision because many of the problems it solves are applicable to every day life, and when done right it feels like ""magic"". I worked with py-opencv at an internship where I learned about the basics of image processing, like thresholding, tracking objects over several frames, and camera pose estimation. Through this experience I'm quite familiar with py-opencv and much of the functionality it provides.

Now, I'm thinking about either working on more CV related projects and get better at things I already know (like some of the topics I mentioned above), or try to do some research in improving the state of the art. I'm an undergrad who has yet to take linear algebra so I know that's the first step to doing any kind of meaningful research in the field.

I read somewhere that all the interesting CV problems are know in the AI/ML ballpark. Is this true, and if so what's the best way to get started? I've tried reading the TensorFlow tutorials countless times but it just doesn't stick (but that's a problem for a different day).

Anyway, if anyone has any experience doing CV in the industry or academia, I would love to know what steps to take next to advance my knowledge in CV and potentially make something new."

More specifically though, some things covered were multi-dimensional arrays, strings, data structures, linked lists, binary trees, recursion, and a few search algorithms. 

What am I supposed to do for a side project? I've read a bunch of people talking about these, but I don't even get what they're talking about when they talk about how they did it. Like I said, the only end product I can do involves printing text on Netbeans.

To sum up, I need a really dumbed down explanation of how I can go about starting side projects."

My salary is definitely quite good relative to a great majority of careers and even software engineers so please don't take this post as gloating or shit-posting.  The real reason I'm posting is that I've been at the same company for 4 years, which is relatively long in silicon valley terms, and I have not interviewed anywhere else in that time, so I genuinely don't know my market value.  Most threads on here seem focused on the ""just out of college"" crowd, but I'm not sure what I could expect elsewhere at this stage in my career.  Glassdoor also seems pretty inaccurate.  For my company, at least, it's way off.

Details
---------------
Me:

-  Graduated from a high quality CS program (not Stanford, but generally ranked in the top 15 or so)
-  Had good grades (&gt; 3.6) and internships (Microsoft, Amazon)

Company:
------------------
-  A well regarded and selective private company in Silicon Valley, Redwood City area (definitely competitive with Google/Facebook/top startups for talent), not yet public but has been growing rapidly and could be public in the not distant future.  This is my first job out of college
 
My career
--------------------
-  Definitely been a good career.  At review time, I've generally received positive reviews and have contributed to the company in ways I can point to.  Recipient of two patents, one of which where I was the lead developer on the project.  With that said, I'm not in a position of ""leadership"" at the company, I'm not a manager and don't have anyone that reports to me
-  I've been at the company for almost 4 years

Salary Details
--------------------
- $153,000 base
- Received a bonus of ~$20,000 this year
- Private stock options, valuation of company has doubled since I've been there so I suspect these will be worth something.  With that said, I wasn't the first 500 employees or anything, so I won't be wealthy from these, but I can be doing pretty well.

My intuition is that my salary is actually fair and probably ""at market"" for my skill level and experience.  Does that seem accurate?  Is this about the same as it would be at google/facebook/amazon?

Quick run down on my current situation. I'm a teacher in a rural area in one of the worst performing states in the US. I make a decent salary of about 40k, about average for my area. I'm starting my 4th year of teaching next school year. 

One year ago, I decided I needed a change in my life because I was unhappy with my current job, not just the school, but with the career itself. I've always been a tech oriented person. The lifestyle of a web developer along with the amazing things a developer can create while working with technology really drove me to this as a career option. I was hesitant at first, but I began self teaching on the side by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Still learning everyday). I try to aim for at least 30 minutes of coding a day. I also have done codecademy's php and MySQL courses. 

A few months ago I reached out to a local marketing company that builds websites and asked for advice on building a career with no background in Tech. After talking with them they have offered an internship that I think could potentially lead to something. They have said they are in need of backend web developer. I believe the internship might stretch into my new school year, which might be hard to balance. They have also said that they would like to train on backend development and that they have been needing someone and looking for extra help. 

I know that this is my last year of teaching, I just can't continue with where I'm at, however does anyone have any advice on balancing a full time career and a small internship on the side? Anyone have advice on transitioning from one career to another and making it at smooth as possible? "

Long time stalker here making my first post on a throw away because I need some serious help on what I should do.

Ok so here is the situation: http://i.imgur.com/4XBM9Pp.gif 

Anyway as for my predicament, I am 19, male and have been put into a situation where I need to start my own life, like really soon.

About 6 months ago, my mother was was wrongfully fired from her job, while she was on vacation no less (cue Friday reference). My mother up to that point had been the sole provider for our family, as my father is unable to work due to health issues. The job she had been fired from has taken 10 years from her that she will never get back and has caused her so much anguish in the past. After that my mother looked for other employment opportunities, as well as waited for an unemployment check that she had to fight her ex-boss in court for (what an ass). Because of that sudden drop in income for our household it was time for me to step up. I had just taken a year off from school after graduating High School to pursue an advancement in my (hopefully) future career. I was given the opportunity to join a program revolving around computers and IT. And I even managed to land a indefinite internship at a software company (they said that they need me to receive a diploma before I can receive full time employment). So for a while I became the bread winner of the house but now its reached the end of its rope. We've decided that we need to make a proper move forward if we are going to get out this mess, and with that my parents and I have decided that the best course of action would be for them to move to Puerto Rico and for me to stay here in the states and start my own life. My parents have family in Puerto Rico that can lend some help until they are able to get back on their feet, and I have a pretty good thing going on here for me so I don't want to leave.

My issue now is that I need to find a place to live by July 15th!

That's when my parents are planning to head to PR and my deadline to find proper living accommodations. Now I would say that I make a pretty decent amount of money right now for somebody who is fresh out of High school. I currently make somewhere south of $1700 a month if I get all my hours in. Now the recommended budget for living expenses per month should be 1/3 of your monthly salary, from what I have heard. After looking online, I have found that it is a bit hard to find a place around where I live that goes for less than $600 a month, and will accommodate a 19 year old male with a pet cat who has no credit. I have no credit I mean, not the cat, well I suppose my cat doesn't have credit either, though I can't give a exact answer on her behalf.
OK enough with the jokes.

Fine people of the interwebs, please help me start my life. I need to figure out what choices or opportunities I have in terms of where I can live. I have never even done my own laundry or dinner, so I am going to have to learn all the aspects of ""adult"" life pretty much all at once, but my first hurdle is, ""where in the hell am I going to put all my shit?"" 

I live in Jersey City in Hudson County and I work in Essex County in Newark.

Thank you to anyone who read that entire wall of text."

I’m having a rough time right now. I spent 4 years at a community college due to poor planning and sucking at the calculus sequence. I transferred with a decent GPA to a UC in computer science. Since then I struggled a lot, usually with the programming assignments which were unexpectedly much tougher than the ones I had in CC. I got disqualified within my first year having a really bad gpa in a quarter. I started making progress towards readmission by taking the courses through the extension program, and I’m doing okay so far.

I have an unrelated min wage job, and all access to university resources like the career center is closed to me. This prevents me from using their websites which features employers posting jobs specifically to students here and job fairs. I was so focused on passing the quarter that I didn’t really go looking around on other websites for internships or do side projects. My grades aren’t great with mostly C’s and B’s.

The first thing I’m asking is whether it’s too late for me to get a internship? I’m an incoming senior now, and all “big” employers like Microsoft and Facebook probably recruited early since the job fairs were at the beginning of each quarter. I have no chance with them anyways, but I expect my academic record is a problem to any employer, even if I am still making progress towards a degree. I live in social right now, and theres a fair amount of companies around here.

The second thing is that most internship are pretty much software engineers. Having struggled in a lot of programming projects at the upper-division level, I feel like I’m under-qualified. There’s some IT internships floating around in most job search sites, but it pays close to min wage and I feel like I’m over-qualified for them which makes me think that it has little value in my resume and career advancement. I do like networking a little bit but I have little experience. Any viable career paths I should consider right now that’s related to cs and whether there’s any good internship opportunities at this point in time?

I've been given an assignment to get some laptops to auto-login and install windows updates, then log off after. I've figured out how to do almost all the steps but one, and it's been driving me crazy.

In order to get windows updates, I need to log onto a user. This would be at 1 AM, so everything needs to be automatic without human interaction outside of the initial setup. Our computers have a notification button you have to click/enter before you can login, then after logging in you also have a computer usage policy you need to hit yes/enter and agree to.

In order to logon and install the updates, I need to get past both of these acknowledgements. I can't just disable them because it needs to be there for when users are usually on. So my alternative was to find a way to autoclick or ideally enter and accept each button by running a program or script.

I tried AutoIt but that seems to only work if a user is already logged in. I was going to try a batch file or vbs file but I'm not sure if those work either and I'm having trouble coding that to do what I need. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I am at a job that I absolutely love but need some improvements yesterday.

I am considered a Junior Dev and have been in the industry for less than a year (without counting internships), so you can say I am quite a newbie in the work environment. My position is of web developer where we use JavaScript for both front and backend.

I am happy to say that I have a pretty descent grasp of the front-end stuff but I completely lack in the backend. I'm not going to lie, I have LOTS of difficulties with it and always have, so I have also avoided it for all my developer life. But I really want to change that! The truth is, I just don't understand the backend, I guess I wasn't really taught it well in school or in previous positions and have avoided it whenever possible. I have read hundreds of tutorials and everything on different languages and frameworks for it, but it can't seem to get through my thick head. I am talking about all the server side set up, complicate SQL queries, the usage of ORMs vs raw SQL x DB Adapters, plugin setup, middleware the truth is I simply don't get it.

To be honest I have a very hard time improving my portfolio because I cannot for the life of me to the app's backend appropriately! Anything more complicated than a simple CRUD app just can't get through to me. Has anyone else had these problems or am I just being stupid for some reason?

I am now going to dedicate my spare time in improving this, I am motivated to get this over with and learn it all once and for all! But now I need to know where can I go to improve this? The company I work for does most of their work with NodeJS and Express. I have already ready all the basic tutorials and documentation of them over and over and over again, so I need something more. Any advice on what could possibly be lacking?

**tl;dr: terrible at backend development, don't understand it for some reason, but REALLY want to change this. Has anyone else felt the same thing? Also, what can I read or do or anything really to change this?**"

I got a job directly out of college last year in June 2016 in electrical engineering working for a very small company of around 4 people very far away from home and where I went to school at the other side of the country. I come to find out that I am doing almost exclusively technician work and I didn't see much room to really learn any engineering skills or move up in the company. In addition, this company was paying me an average salary for the city where I graduated, but the city I moved to had a much higher cost of living.  After a 3-4 months I start looking for a different job back near where I went to school, which is in a city only a couple hours from where I grew up. All of my friends and my boyfriend still live in this city which is mostly why I almost exclusively looked for jobs back there. It was tough interviewing from that far away with all of the flights and interviews, but I eventually got an offer that had a 9% pay bump and was in sales engineering, something I really liked working in. I really felt like I just took the first offer because I really wanted to move ASAP. I left my first job after working there for 6 months.


Now I have been working at my current job for about 6-7 months and its really not all that I hoped it was. I really like working with people, managing projects, interfacing with the outside of the company. I really am more interested in the sales, marketing, management, financial side of a business. I originally got a major in engineering because I didn't know what I wanted to do going into college. The industry I am in is machining and manufacturing, so it really has little to do with my electrical engineering interests, and I just don't feel like I fit in culturally: everyone I work with (both inside and outside the company) is 20+ years my senior, much more conservative, from a different generation, and just not like me at all. This company is also pretty small. I'm really having a tough time socializing much and enjoying my work place. It also doesn't help that we are using completely outdated software and my commute is about an hour each way.


I'm posting here to figure out what options I have. Can I move careers again so quickly? I've been thinking about going back to school for an MBA, will that even help me? I would really live to get a job downtown and work in a younger more high tech environment, but feel like I'm stuck after all the job hopping. 


Can anyone give me some insight or have experience with this?

6jw597,442,2017-06-27,I Tested a Ride Called HEADRUSH,ButTheyWereGone,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6jw597/i_tested_a_ride_called_headrush/,"When I was strapped for cash in the 90s, I took some pretty odd listings just to make a couple bucks. For (usually short) periods of time, I'd been a carpet cleaner, washer/dryer installer, an intern at a DMV (never again) and among other less exciting things - a ride tester. That's right, between other gigs I'd get called in by a contractor to serve as a ""focus group"" of sorts for roller coasters and other rides for an amusement park. Due to the events following, I legally can not and will not name the park or anyone involved. 

The job itself was infrequent and didn't pay that much, but I saw it as an easy $15 and free entertainment to boot. 

Understand that the rides weren't dangerous in any way. They'd already been run well through the inspection ringer before us testers came along to actually use it. We were simply there for one simple thing. Was the ride fun, or not? I tested a total of 5 rides before the incident, and they all passed my standards of fun. 

Outside of myself was (the following are all substitute names) Rich, a sort of older guy who seemed to love the rides to death. Honestly I'd believe he was paying THEM to let him ride. He laughed and and screamed and was just sort of a goof. There was another man, Thomas, who was a little younger than Rich and was in the other boat. He never seemed to like the rides much, I think they scared him but he couldn't resist the easy money. Lastly there was a girl a bit younger than myself, Sarah, who was quiet and shy but enjoyed them well enough. I never did learn why she was testing those rides with us. 

It's a clear day in March, and we're scheduled to test a ride called HEADRUSH (yes, in all caps). We meet up with the maintenance manager, who brings us to the site. A lot of the park itself was still under construction, as well as some of the rides. Walking through practically a city of plastic tarps and colorful signs was surreal to say the least. While walking I made small talk with the manager, ""So, when're you guys expecting the grand opening?"" 

He furrowed his brow and walked in silence for a moment, before carefully responding, ""At the moment, its unclear when or if the park will actually open at all. We already made quite a few cuts in the maintenance department, and I know there's been layoffs on a sizable number of staff. I'm not sure who's in charge of budgeting, but they overestimated."" 

After a sobering answer like that, any further chance at small talk died. 

Arriving at the site, I got my first good look at the man, or machine, of the hour, HEADRUSH. Essentially, it was a Tower of Terror style ride, maybe the one of the first of it's kind. Absolutely plastered head to toe with green lightning bolts and a blue backdrop. Unlike later versions of the ride, the track appeared to disappear up into a cube-like structure that at the very top. On its front in neon red font it read HEADRUSH. From my guess I'd say it stood maybe a little over 200 feet. Prior to this, I'd never seen one of those ""drop"" rides in person, so I was nervous and excited upon seeing it. A member of the staff worked the console on the bottom, and one stood at the mouth of the gate. 

We four only occupied one side, all in all HEADRUSH could seat 8 people at a time. Once we were all strapped in and secured, the manager began his usual rundown of what the ride does, safety precautions, normal stuff.  

""So you'll be dropping multiple times. The first ascent is slowest, after that you'll gradually speed up. The belts and holders will keep you totally fastened to the gondola at all times. So again, no worries, just tell us if it's fun."" He gave us a half smile before backing up to the console worker. Looking up to the top of the ride and speaking into her walkie walkie, she asked, ""Ready to go, over?"" 

After a moment, a quiet voice crackled back over the receiver, ""I'm ready."" 

And after a second or two, we were moving. During our gentle glide up, butterflies infested me. I turned to the right of my end seat, where Sarah was sitting. ""Ever been on one of these?"" I tried to make small talk to ignore that I was now 60 feet and climbing in the air. ""No."" She responded with a nervous laugh. Rich whooped and hollered once we got to 150 feet or so. The wind was a lot crisper that high up. I looked up and saw we approached the mouth of the cube. To my surprise, it didn't stop just below it, we actually traveled fully into the structure. We stopped about two feet off the floor of the room. 

The inside should've been dark, but the light from the opening still illuminated most of the interior. Situated to our right was a console similar to the one at the bottom, with the attendants chair empty. The rest of the room was mostly beams and cables. My guess was just an extra staffer in case a rider was hysterical or emergency maintenance. A guard railing separated the gondola and the rest of the inside. We sat in tense anticipation, and I practically held my breath waiting for the drop. I could hear my heart thumping in my ears. 

In a single fluid motion, a black shape came around the other side of the gondola and an ear splitting bang rings out. 

And then we drop. 

Thomas is screaming. 

Sarah is breathing fast. 

But Rich is silent. 

As we plummet, wind whipping past my ears and the force making my stomach drop, I look to my right. I can see nothing past Thomas's writhing and screaming, but I do see a thin trail of dark red tailing Rich's seat. The ride slows and my head is spinning. As we come to a near stop I look forward, but no words escape. The manager and worker smile, mistaking Thomas's screaming for immersion in the ride. Only when small droplets of blood begin to rain down on us and the pavement in front do their expressions begin to change. Before we can say another word the gondola is moving again. 

We're climbing fast. Sarah starts squirming too, raising her voice and pulling at her restraints. ""No, no no! Please no!"" Thomas's screaming is reaching crescendo as we once again approach the mouth of the room. I sit, stunned by a numb sense of disbelief. I still feel Rich's blood on my face. 

Our ride gently stops in its same spot. Standing at the console, one hand held down on a bright green button, is a mousy looking man. He almost looks dressed for Church. In his right hand he holds a gun. It's only now that I notice tucked just behind the console, a red substance is pooling. I can barely make out the colors of an employee uniform. Thomas starts to get out the word ""Please."" Before I can take anything else in, another bang envelopes my senses. Then we drop. 

The ride down is much quieter this time. Unable to stop myself, I look again to the right and see Thomas's face split open at the bridge of the nose. His glassy eyes stare at nothing. Sarah's now babbling and clawing even more furiously at her restraints. As we approach the bottom once more I now see the manager and console worker straining to look up and see what's going on. The worker's eyes land on Tom and she begins screaming. Suddenly I snap back into reality as we stop.

""FUCKING STOP THE RIDE! STOP IT!"" 

The manager is already scrambling to the podium and turning his key repeatedly, apparently to no avail. The radio on his side was just coming off his belt as we started back up. 

Sarah's screaming is so frantic. I can't look at her. I do anyway. She's given up trying to get out and instead is trying to make herself as small as she can, face bleary and red with tears. We're moving fast. I know what I have to do. 

We're swallowed once again by the room. The man eyes us expressionlessly, waiting patiently for us to stop. He looks dead behind his glasses already. 

""Shoot me.""

I barely recognize the words as my own. 

""Shoot me. Don't shoot her. Please man. Don't shoot her."" 

*She's no more than 20. She's got a future. I don't, I've already wasted my chance. Take me. Don't take her. Don't take her.*

He pauses, his brow furrowing. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but instead the room fills with noise and light and we're falling. I'm covered in blood. I feel my body, my face, everywhere for the wound.

I look to my right. I think Sarah looks fine. But as we fall, her head lilts ever so slightly towards me, revealing the right side of her face. Or rather, what used to be the right side of her face. 

I see a man in a white and black uniform footing it to the hysterical manager and worker. I barely touch the bottom before I'm rocketing up again. I find some odd comfort in knowing that there was nothing I could've done to stop him. To stop any of this. The wind is cold against my skin. Then I'm inside again. 

The man takes his hand off the green button for a split second and hits a large, protruding red one. An emergency stop, my guess. 

We exchange no words, he simply stops in front of me, and smooths his shirt. The word why almost escapes my mouth, but something in me holds on. As if it even matters why. Instead, he speaks, only one thing. 

""Now you live with it."" 

And in one swift motion, he sticks the gun into the roof of his mouth and pulls the trigger. A shower of red plasters the wall and ceiling behind him as his thin body crumples to the floor. 

I stayed up there for another 15 minutes covered in blood and surrounded by five dead bodies before they finally disengaged the ride. 

---

I never learned why. Through nearly a year of litigation, serving as the sole eye witness, I never figured out why. From what they gathered he had somehow snuck into the park and gotten onto the backside of the ride before or around the same time they ferried the top console worker up. 

Instead of explaining further I was offered a tremendous settlement and reparations to keep quiet . I suppose I'm breaking some form of it by even speaking generally about this, but it's not like it matters. Against fantastic odds, the park still opened two years after this. And it's been running ever since, successfully I might add. Of course HEADRUSH is nowhere to be seen. I'm assuming they tore that down and scrapped it as soon as they could. The site of the ride is concessions now. 

But the shooter got his wish. I still live with it. And always will.

A recruiter sent me an email to apply online. Fast-forward, rejection. Do be clear, I did not have any internship experience at the time, and I'm an IT major. I knew it was a reach. 

At the time, I already had secured a summer internship (which is my current job) so it didn't hurt me much.

Right now, I am looking for full time opportunities. Should I email the recruiter my updated resume? Or should I just apply through the company website hoping my resume will be sent to a different recruiter.

6jw8b2,1,2017-06-27,I need some troubleshooting tips PCMR!,PUSHAxC,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6jw8b2/i_need_some_troubleshooting_tips_pcmr/,"Okay, so let me explain my situation first. I'm looking for a job, and I went with my mom to pick up our computer from a small shop in town. While I was there, I asked if they were hiring at all, and the manager/owner took me to his office and talked to me for a bit. He asked me what kind of experience I have, and I told him I'm good with computers and I've built/troubleshooted my own, but I also made sure that he knew I wasn't exactly an expert. He offered to have me come in tomorrow and take a ""tech test."" 

Basically, as I understand it, this means that I'll come in and they'll have me try and fix a computer that isn't working. He knows I'm not too experienced and offered it anyway, so I figured I'll go in and give it a shot. If I do well I can get the job or a paid internship, and if I do poorly I can still maybe get an unpaid internship of sorts to learn more, which would still be pretty cool (obviously if I really fuck up, I won't be getting any kind of internship). My expectations, however, aren't too high because, if I'm being honest, I might be in over my head a bit. 

Now I'm sure there are some people on here that are much more experienced than me with troubleshooting computers and their hardware, so I figured maybe there were a few things I should make sure to try during the test. I've troubleshooted my own computer a couple times, but it's been a while, and I'm sort of nervous about seriously bombing this test, even though I don't really have much to lose. I know if I could just get an internship that I could learn the tougher stuff and be good at the job, though I do need to do well enough tomorrow to hopefully get to that point.

PCMR troubleshooting experts, please help me. Any kind of advice/help at all would be much appreciated."

i'm an MIS major at a random state school. i started in CS but switched to MIS after struggling in my first Java programming class.
since then, I've taken 2 java courses (in the MIS department so easier than the CS versions) and got an A &amp; A- in those classes. and have had 2 IT internships (business analytics related) with a fortune 300 financial company &amp; with a fortune 10 health care company. i've also completed some web dev on the side in my own free time and built my own website (yes i know this isn't that impressive). at my first internship i partook in a hackathon with other IT interns and built a complete web app from scratch despite having 0 real coding experience and actually really enjoyed it.

now that you have my background here is what i'm getting at. is software engineering that tough? i'm trying to figure out if i've scared myself into thinking i'm not smart enough for SWE or if i'm actually just being realistic (did poorly in my Calc 1 class before switching to the business field). right now i'm under the impression that those in SWE are extremely smart and live and breathe code (constantly making apps on their own, answering peoples questions on github/stackoverflow etc) whereas i'm the one asking for help all the time on stackoverflow for homework assignments. will i not survive as a SWE at any sort of company and instead concentrate on other IT roles?

please be brutally honest, thanks!"

I don't currently have any real work experience and my resume only consists of leadership roles and volunteer activities.

I'm not in a big rush to get something, but I'd like to know if it's possible and if it's worth my time searching or if I should just try to continue building up my skills and apply for something next summer. I also found that many internships only occur in the summer so it seems extremely difficult to find a good one. Additionally, most of the ones on intern.supply seem to be tailored to junior/seniors or at least people with more work experience and large projects under their belt.

I just don't want to be in a situation where I'm a junior or senior and still not have any applicable experience (aka my situation now but as a junior/senior) so I figured it can't hurt evaluating my options now. Thanks for any help/advice!"
6jwnn3,96,2017-06-27,Coffee Stains,radgarlic,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6jwnn3/coffee_stains/,"I looked at my mug, the words “World’s #1 Dad” emblazoned on the outside. My lovely daughter, Summer, had given it to me as a Father’s Day gift, and I had just started drinking from it after many days of using it as desktop decor. Smiling, I raised the cup to take a swig of coffee, but nothing entered my mouth. “Dammit.” Nothing inside but coffee stains.


I leaned back with my mug in hand, taking a break from the mound of work on my desk. My, oh my, oh my, what a freaking big lump of proposals to edit. As I absent-mindedly looked at my mug again, something caught my eye. Something seemed off about the coffee stains. They seemed to form a pattern...that resembled a printer. Ha, now this is something more interesting than work!! Kinda cool, you know. The stains even showed some details, such as the lines for the drawers where you put the paper and the toner cartridge in. I poked at the stains, watching in wonder at the various intricacies - 


A loud bang sounded from behind me, startling me and a few of my coworkers. I turned around to find that Sharon, that bumbling intern, had knocked into the printer while carrying a huge bundle of files, which were now scattered over the place. The machine had also fallen over, pinning Kevin underneath, another intern who by now was screaming bloody murder. With a sigh, the workers surrounding them, including me, stood up to help Kevin out of his little predicament.


As Kevin chastised Sharon about her extreme clumsiness - seriously though, no one else but Sharon can miss a machine twice the size of her waist, AND knock it over - I thought about the coffee stains. After ensuring that both of them had no serious injuries (other than their bruised pride), I made my way back to my desk, and stared into my coffee mug, trying to get another glimpse of the coffee stains. Most of it was still there. I could still see the outline of the printer, but some of it seemed to have blurred. I couldn’t see some of the lines that framed so nicely the intricate details of the printer. It was as if the stains in the mug magically faded a little after the incident happened. However, being the rational person I am, I dismissed it as just a mere coincidence. My drinking pattern simply coincided with the small contours on the side of the cup, to form a nice little pattern that looked just like the incident that was about to happen.


The next morning, I had a slightly thinner stack of paper on my desk. Slouching back on my cheap office chair, I raised my cup to take a sip of my favourite drug, annnnnd nothing entered my mouth. “Dammit.” Cursing, I looked inside again, to find nothing but coffee stains. 


This time, my coffee stains didn’t look anything like a printer. Today, there were relatively fewer lines, all converging on a single point - wait, that looks like the corner of a table. Huh, that’s funny. Well I guess I drank my coffee at a faster rate this time, so there isn’t much time for the coffee to settle on the sides of the cup - 


“Hey!” I yelped as my arm was suddenly kicked from behind, and my elbow jerked forward, hitting a box holding several files, which was unfortunately placed at the corner of my desk. I watched as my carefully-organised folders fell to the floor, in a deafening “FLOP FLOP FLOP”. I looked up in annoyance and found the sheepish face of my cubicle partner James, who was holding his empty water bottle.


“Sorry Lance, I didn’t see your arm.” James bent down to give me a hand with the documents, which were now scattered all over the floor. 


“James, watch where you step! I spent half of yesterday organising those stuff.” 


“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! I’ll help you with this shit after I finish my proposal.”


“Nah, it’s okay. Most of these stuff is mine anyways, I like it sorted out my way.”


I waved James away and gathered all my stuff. Gosh, that James undid all my hard work, now I have to redo everything all over again. If he was an intern, I would have unleashed hell on him, and sentenced him to the more cramped cubicles in the basement. I stared at my coffee cup. The coffee stains were now more blurred, where the bottom marks are almost too faded to be seen. Much like the printer image the day before. My curiosity was piqued. I thought it was just a show of affection from my lovely daughter. But could it be more than an ordinary mug? I glanced at the extra work that James just added to my already hectic schedule today, and hastily brushed those idle thoughts away.


On Wednesday, I paid much more attention to my coffee mug than usual, noticing how my coffee left marks on the side. As the minutes pass by slowly, the water line in my mug gradually went down, leaving stains as expected. What I did not expect, was that the stains did not form any discernible patterns like the previous two days. I was completely bewildered, but continue examining it every time I took a sip. 


By 10.10 am, I finished my coffee, and proceeded to spend about five minutes scrutinising each and every stain inside my coffee mug. I attracted a few curious glances from my coworkers as I spun my mug round and round and cocked my head to the side, trying to get a better angle. They probably thought I went a little looney after I put in some overtime the day before. But to no avail, I couldn’t see anything. 


“Lance, you need a coffee top-up? I can get some for you if you like.” James came over with his empty water bottle.


“No need, thank you.” I looked up for a moment. “You going to the pantry? Mind bringing over some chips? Sour cream and onion, thank you.”


“No problem, Lance.” James went on his way and I turned my attention back to the mug. There’s a rectangle inside a larger rectangle, then there’s a few short lines, then there’s this round blotch at the side. Yeah, a little weird, doesn’t it look like a...microwave?


Immediately, I jumped up from my seat and turned around, catching a glimpse of James as he rounded the corner and entered the pantry. I took off after him, pushing past the cabinets and coworkers in the corridor. James had just started refilling his water bottle when I reached the entrance of the pantry.


“Hey Lance! You decided to pick up the chips yourself?”


His smile disappeared into a surprised gasp as I tackled him to the floor.


“What the hell Lance?!” His irritated glance raked my face. 


“Er….” I was at a loss for words when faced with his expression of anger. But all questions were answered by thunderous bang behind us. We both rolled away for cover as sparks and small pieces of debris showered us.


With our ears still ringing, we picked ourselves up to find that the microwave had exploded - just a few inches away from where James’ head had been. The door had split up into charred, twisted pieces that pelted us along with the burnt remains of someone’s instant pasta. If I hadn’t pushed James out of the way, I wouldn’t want to know what his face would have looked like in the full blast of the explosion. 


“Er, thanks for saving me, Lance. How did you know - why did you tackle me to the ground - why…” James, while grateful, couldn’t really find his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the incident. 


“I saw sparks in the microwave.” I lied. No one would believe me anyway. After helping a shaken James back to his table, I returned to my own work desk and stared at my coffee mug. As expected, the coffee stains had already blurred. I looked at the ceramic receptacle, perched so innocently on a stack of unfinished reports. Slowly, I bent over and whispered softly, “Thank you.”


From that day onwards, I was pretty attentive to my fortune-telling coffee companion. It did help me, and many fortunate coworkers, a lot. From files placed precariously on shelves, plugs not plugged in securely, heavy objects placed on top of cabinets - I must have prevented many stubbed toes, swollen foreheads, short circuits, you name it, I’ve saved it. I became known as the guy who would spot accidents before they happened. It was some Final Destination shit - just less morbid, and also even though I prevented the incident from happening, the would-be victim wouldn’t suffer any worse consequences. None that I know of anyways. It was felt good to have such a power. I began treating the cup not as a receptacle, but as a friend, making sure to carefully set it down on the table far from the edges and away from any sharp objects that could scratch it.


Recently, due to poor sales, our firm had been struggling to break even. The situation has gotten so bad, that the higher-ups have considered laying off some staff, in a bid to reduce costs. As a result, the mood in the office has changed from the usual upbeat atmosphere to a more gloomy one, where everyone was tried to prove their worth by taking on more projects even though the said projects were becoming more scarce. The pressure was at an all-time high, with many people stressing over their future at the firm. I was not left out - I became more selfish too, trying to solo the simpler tasks so as to prove that I was efficient and indispensable to the firm. It’s human nature, after all - my rice bowl was threatened.


As I became more and more self-absorbed, I stopped saving people from mishaps. It wasn’t that I was too caught up with work to watch my coffee stains anymore - I actually paid more attention to it, to avoid meeting with accidents myself. But for other incidents that happened to my coworkers - I decided to turn a blind eye. Accidents started happening again, and sometimes, it helps relieve the pressure on me. Some worker injures himself from, say tripping over a box full of files, gets his leg strained, decides to take sick leave, which lowers his reputation among the higher-ups and gives his partners a chance to prove themselves, thus damning his own chances to stay in the company. I’ve seen it, and sad to say, I’ve *enjoyed* watching people lose their jobs like this.


But yesterday was different. Yesterday was so different.


When I finished my coffee yesterday morning, I saw something I’ve never seen before - an image of a malicious-looking person holding a knife. The person had an elongated face, with narrow eyes, narrow nose and thick lips curled in a snarl. I was petrified, and was at a total loss of words. What was going to happen? I looked around me, at all my fellow workers working feverishly on their own projects. I don’t recall anyone in here with such a long face that was able to make such an expression.


I got up and went to the pantry, intending to top up my coffee, in the hope of getting new coffee stains so that I could get a clearer picture of what would happen. As I refilled my mug, I idly looked out the window at the carpark, and I spotted a man wearing a black jacket walking towards the entrance of the building. Squinting, I could make out his trademark triangular face, his sharp nose and his small eyes. That was Jeremy, one of those who got laid off just a week ago. He shouldn’t be wearing a jacket under the blazing hot sun, and he shouldn’t be walking into an office where he doesn’t work at anymore. What was he up to?


It didn’t take long to make the connection. Shit was about to hit the fan. Now, the problem was what should I do?


On one hand, I could stir up the entire office, evacuate everyone and call the police. It wouldn’t take them much to believe me, considering my “fortune-telling” reputation. I would be lauded a hero. However, there was a chance that I’ll be branded a lunatic, since I only predicted small accidents, and if Jeremy only came to pick up the rest of his stuff, then the false alarm would kick me out of the boss’s good books. On the other hand….I could hide, and let Jeremy literally *kill* off all my competition. After all, my coffee stains were always right - something big was definitely gonna happen, and I didn’t want to be on the receiving end. Maybe...maybe I’ll be traumatised and claim insurance and go for free counselling.


Choices were hard, and being anxious at that point in time, I couldn’t think clearly. I went with the second choice.


I entered the toilet, and hid in one of the cubicles. Sitting down, praying, praying….it was silence outside for a good ten minutes. I began to wonder if I was just paranoid. Perhaps my mug had predicted wrongly, for the first time? I stared hard at my coffee cup. The image was still there, every detail in stark contrast to the original white colour of the cup, having not blurred one bit.


Then the screams started.


I jumped up and leaned against the cubicle door, listening intently to the commotion outside. The faint patter of rushed footsteps, the muffled shrieks of terror, stifled sounds of furniture breaking. I closed my eyes. All that - could have been prevented, or at least deescalated, if I had done something about it. Maybe I could have gotten a few close friends to hide with me, or ask them to discreetly pass down the message, to evacuate the office...millions of thoughts ran through my head, but none spoke louder than the nasal, squeaky voice: “It’s alright, you’ll surely be indispensable to the company when they’re all dead.” It’s amazing how cowardice sounded so meek, yet his words reverberated through my entire being. I exhaled, and let him take control of me. I found myself on the lavatory, opening up the ceiling access door, then squeezing myself into the tiny crawlspace together with dust-encrusted pipes and cables. After I put back the trapdoor in place, I watched as my boss Trevor run into the toilet with James and Matthew, followed closely behind by a bloodstained Jeremy wielding an equally bloodstained knife.


“Look, Jeremy, we can work this out, let’s not make any rash decisions…”


“I have five kids and a wife. They depend on me to put food on the table, to pay for the house, to finance their education...and you sacked ME!” The heat of Jeremy’s rage burnt through the false ceiling.


“Jeremy, we all have families to feed. Please, Jeremy, I have a wife and two kids too, you know they depend on me as well -”


“If you decided my family was the unlucky one, I don’t see why I can’t make your family unlucky too.” Jeremy didn’t hesitate. He stepped forth and started working his knife on the three men.


I don’t remember much. It was all over in a flash. Blood spattered all over the stalls, not dissimilar from the microwave explosion I saved James from. I recalled limbs flying about. Flashes as the knife reflected the fluorescent lights. Grunts as Jeremy landed blow after blow. Screams as the three workers shielded themselves. Gurgles as their throats opened up. My traumatic stupor wasn’t really helpful to the police when they interviewed me after they helped me down from my hiding place.


As I sat in the interview room, safe and sound in the police station, I fidgeted with the coffee mug, which I refused to let go of. The image had more or less blurred, but the ugly face remained clear as ever. The longer I looked at it, the more the snarl resembled a smile. That demonic coffee stain, sniggering at my self-imposed silence. I could hear it laughing, as I replayed the memories of me voluntarily suppressing my warnings to others. It giggled as I remembered that fateful moment I turned and made my way to the toilet. It guffawed at the image burnt into my retina - the image of James making eye contact with me through the slit in the ceiling, him reaching out above him, trying to shield himself - or was he reaching out for me? Asking me for help one last time? - and his final dying gurgle as blood spurted out from the gaping wound opened up by the knife.

6jxelv,6,2017-06-27,Profile Review: Transportation Sector,MBA456,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/6jxelv/profile_review_transportation_sector/,"**Background**  

&amp;nbsp;

Work experience:  

Four years (at matriculation) in Fortune 500 railroad company's corporate planning department. Department can be considered an internal consultant and is tasked with shrinking and growing the railroad's physical footprint (through acquisitions, mergers, sales, etc.).  

Since starting as a trainee, I've worked on a myriad of projects, including merger analyses, rail line leases, investments in capacity improvements, and maps and presentations for senior management. I've been promoted twice since starting and now have the opportunities to lead projects instead of simply supporting them. Many in the company have recognized that I am a reliable source of knowledge on my railroad's network and the setup of the industry in general.  

I interned in the railroad's track maintenance department during college. I know undergrad internships aren't usually considered by MBA admissions, but I figured it's an interesting point since it broadened my exposure to the railroad by introducing me to railroad operations (exposure many office workers at railroads don't have). These experiences have made me better at my corporate planning job. 

&amp;nbsp; 


Extra curriculars:  

I lead my company's young professionals group, which plans and implements professional development, networking, mentorship, and volunteering events. I've also joined a few railroad history groups which allow me to network with industry veterans. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Undergrad school/major: Civil Engineering at a top-10 civil program (think big state school with top-20 engineering program overall)

&amp;nbsp;

Other education/coursework: I took 7 business classes as electives during undergrad. Not enough to get a business minor, but I learned the basics of economics, finance, marketing, and business law. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Race/nationality/sex: white male  

&amp;nbsp;

**Stats**  

&amp;nbsp;

GMAT score: 730 (41V, 48Q, 5W, 6IR)  
Undergrad GPA: 3.99 (one A-, in an elective, from a 4.0)  

&amp;nbsp;

**MBA Info**  

I've always been a fan of railroading. I got into the industry using my undergrad program to get the engineering internships. Once in the industry, I realized that corporate planning matched my interests and talked my way into a job, despite my background. I feel I've thrived since graduation, and my work is well-noticed.  

This industry promotes a lot of cross-training, and I do not see my stint in corporate planning lasting an entire career. My superiors have encouraged my to get an MBA to increase my leadership skills and make me a good fit for more departments in the company. My career aspiration is to get into executive management at this, or a similar, company.  

I've been encouraged to explore all program types (part-time, executive, and full-time), but I believe company preference will be one of the first two. Company funding is 100% for part-time and TBD for the other two types. There are a few top 15 executive programs within weekend distance, but not having 5 years' experience worries me about my chances there.  

With my young age and not much tying me down, I'd like to try getting into the best school I can and not rule out full-time (especially if a top-15 program is achievable with my background). Looking at the industry titans over the past few decades, most that weren't lawyers had M7 MBAs (with quite a few Harvard degrees). I'm loyal to the company, but I'm still willing to consider full-time and then getting back into the railroad or greater transportation industry after graduation. Obviously, my decision has to make sense financially.  

Thoughts? Do the big-time MBA programs like applicants that want to climb the corporate ladder and be industry leaders? Does the financial burden (assuming little/no company support) of a full-time MBA generally outweigh the significance of having a big-time degree when climbing the ladder? Thanks for your consideration and comments!

I am in need of some career advice, and wasnt sure where to ask. Im a recent Mech Eng grad (2016), and im stuck between two jobs. In the summer of my junior year and the beginning of my senior year I was desperate to get a full time job lined up for graduation. I had a good GPA and had some internship experience, had interviews but had no offers for about 6 months. Around February 2016 I heard from a big defense contractor recruiter, went to the interview and got an offer. Since i was desperate, and was back in the same area where my parents lived it seemed like the perfect match.  The work was controls heavy (systems engineering) so it seemed like i would enjoy it. What i didnt understand was that the job was contingent on receiving a security clearance and the length of security clearance investigation. I had a job offer, but I couldnt work until I got cleared. I talked to the hiring manager and he said that there was nothing he could offer me to do if i had no security clearance, and the recruiter said the same thing. I was informed that i shouldnt work anywhere else since it would delay or potentially stop my security clearance. They also informed me that a TS SCI would only take 5-7 months. Turns out that was not the case. I applied for my TS in March thinking that by the november of 2016 at the latest i would be working.  I waited, and I waited. Nothing happened, and after contacting the hiring manager all i got was: the process takes a year now, the process takes 13 months now, etc etc. I know he had no control over it, but I couldnt sit at my parent's house without doing anything for a whole year.  I applied for a job in a smaller construction company as a systems engineer thinking I would at least be getting some experience. I got the new offer and the title said office engineer. I asked the manager of the construction company about it, and he said it was just for HR to handle salary and such. I started working and turns out they put me in construction management, and never got exposure to anything i did in school. I was sad for about 2 months, but i thought i should make the best of it. I have been working here for about 6 months. The work is basically sending out bids for projects to GCs, and we mainly specialize in Electrical work (I have some electrical background but dont know much about switchgear, and automatic transfer switches for generators). I have teaching myself every aspect of the job, and have finally started making sense of the components. However the work is extremely dull. 

Now after months of working at a different job, I heard back from an investigator and got interviewed. Then a new hiring manager from the defense contractor contacted me, and told me the old hiring manager left the company and that he would like to bring me in. Soon after that i heard from him about a week later that my security clearance went through, and Im cleared. He gave me dates to start and be on boarded. I thought about staying in my current employment but i dont feel excited about the work and i dont feel like i fit in even after 6 months. Im ecstatic and want to move on with my career but dont want to leave my current employment without something concrete. I have the old offer that was signed in 2016, but im not sure if thats as good as a brand new offer. How do i transition from my current company to the new company?

I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how I should be approaching my goal, should I be applying to US companies directly or is it better to find work here then transfer? Is there a way to filter companies that are willing to fly people out/sponsor visas? I can get the e3 visa as far as I'm aware so hopefully that helps.

6jy2yo,2,2017-06-27,Are these the proper steps to calculate Air Consumption of Pneumatic?,plu3m01,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6jy2yo/are_these_the_proper_steps_to_calculate_air/,"Original post here: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/steps-to-calculate-air-consumption-of-pneumatic.918792/

Hi there, I'm new to reddit and this is my first post so nice to meet you all! Since English is my second language, I apologize for some odd sentences.

I'm a 4th year university student and currently has an internship in a Press Shop of a car manufacturer in Thailand. The project has been given to me by the training staff to find a solution for quality problems in a specific part stamping operation due to the reason stated below.

For a quality problem, a specific part has die marks (a scratch caused by lower die setting is not in a right position when upper die is stamping). A cause of the problem is two pneumatic cylinders installed in the lower die(in order to set the die in the right shape prepare for stamping) are not supplied by proper amount of compressed air within the set timing(in short, like pneumatic need to complete its cycle within 5 seconds for the lower die to set in a right shape, but right now the pneumatic spend like 10 seconds per cycle).

My solution for the problem is to redesign pipeline, valves or add an air tank to the line. This idea is coming up because when I calculated the air flow rate using the current pipe size a result shows that compressed air flow is not sufficient for the current operation.

The question is ""How do I know that my calculation steps utilized are proper?"" so I'm here to ask experts!

Given Specs: Bore diameter 250mm , Stroke 200mm, Rod diameter 60mm , operate at 5 bar at STP.
The cylinder is a Double-Acting type with required Extend Stroke 1.177 sec and Retract Stroke 2.200 sec.

These are the steps how I design for air consumption, required flow rate and pipe/valve sizing.

- Calculate pneumatic air consumption in SCFM (SCFMtotal = SCFMextend + SCFMretract)

- Calculate Flow Coefficient(Cv) to select a proper valve size.

- Pipe Sizing and system specs (pipe size, length, fitting) by using SCFMtotal obtained from (1.) to select a proper Pipe Size and effective length.

Here's some additional questions:
Do the calculation steps above sufficient enough to design for the system?
Is an air tank needed in the system, what is its profit?

Is there any improper calculation steps above, I'm waiting for your advice! :smile:
Thanks in advance! and nice to meet you all again."

I'm putting my stats down below. I had a real dip in grades in my junior year (no excuses, all on me, I joined a coaching class for an entrance exam studying things that I could not make any sense out of and wasted all my time there)

ACT: 35
SAT Subject Tests: Awaited, but I'm expecting a 780-800 on Math2 and a 750-780 on Physics. 
TOEFL: 103

9th and 10th grade: 84%
11th: 60% (again, all on me)
12th: 80%

(Taking a gap year)

My grades are bad, no joke, but I hope my ECs can make up for them. I have lots of extracurriculars in competitive programming (couple national-level ones and lots of inter-school competitions), currently interning (paid) at a very reputed company leading my own project creating a learning platform for students and writing detailed editorials for coding competitions.

Also interning at another place focused on bringing Data Science knowledge to schools by people at UCB, responsible for curriculum development and teaching. I'm also attending a very selective training camp in Algorithms (about 30 students from schools and colleges across the country).

Other smaller achievements include being the programming head of my school's computer club, completed 28+ tasks under an organization in Google Code-In 2014, a couple certified MOOCs in CS, freeCodeCamp certifications (400+ hours of coursework with 12 projects).

I love learning and teaching, so I have a lot of experience in guide-writing which is part of two of my internships. I also have glowing letters of recommendations from my CS teacher and two people I was working under.

I don't consider myself competitive at Stanford, MIT, or any other elite Ivy/Ivy-level colleges, my grades are shit. 

Right now, I'm applying to colleges that don't require me to submit my junior year scores, which are UIUC, UCLA, UCB, UCD and UCSD. Other colleges I'm applying to include Gatech, UW-Seattle, UT-D, USC, Purdue and Drexel. 

Out of all of these, I'd be the happiest person on the planet if I get to attend UIUC. But really, I'd die to attend any of these.

I guess this became more of a 'chance me' post, but the questions I want to ask are:-

1. Can my ECs somehow, someway make me competitive at the schools above? They're no substitute for actual grades, but I can't improve my grades now T: I'm doing lots of stuff in my gap year though.

2. Are there any colleges you would recommend I apply to?"

Trying to keep it around the $1100 that it is at right now, already have a decent monitor from a friend so no worries about that. Decided on going with the I5 7600k rather than I7 because I have no plans on streaming or anything at the moment. Have some adjusted prices on there, those are just local prices/price matches I can do. Just had a couple of questions:

the 1070 is about $420 with a price match, but I saw that EVGA does B stock 1080s for $450 so should I possibly buy that online then rest in store?

Am I wasting money by having parts too simple/complex for each other?

Im definitely going to be getting a 144hz monitor at some point. My birthday is this week so I can either get that monitor from my parents or cut around $200 off of my build and possibly clean it up a bit with that extra money.

Any criticism is welcome, thanks :D

I am new to this sub reddit. I have always been interested in IT since I was a kid. I am 31 years old and I am preparing to go back to work after dealing with some medical issues. Before my medical issues, I spent 7 years doing security for TSA. Before that, I went to college for a few years.  

I have little to no formal experience in IT. I have built a computer with my dad and I fix all of my IT related issues myself. I want to start a career in IT. My plan is to enter and complete a job training program that will allow me to earn my CCENT, CCNA R&amp;S, and MCSA Desktop. After that, I plan to attend my local community college, and earn an associates in networking and use that to transfer to a 4 year university to finish my bachelors. The job training program is approximately 4 months, and because I finished my prerequisites at my former university, I just have to take the   
IT courses for my major. My time at the community college will be around a year or a year and a half. I have to go to a community college first because I flunked out of my university the first time around and I have to go to a community college to get my GPA up. 

In the meantime, I was planning to get some sort of entry level IT job to earn experience while I am in school. As far as this is concerned, I have no idea where to start. All of the jobs I've looked at online require experience and/or a degree. When, I look at internships, it seems like they're even harder to get than a job. As far as building a professional network, I have no idea where to start and I'm not the greatest ""people person"". I have checked out meetup, but the vast majority of meetups seem professionally focused and/or focused on coding, which I hate.  

TLDR: I'm going to attend a job training program to get my CCENT, CCNA R&amp;S, and MCSA Desktop. Afterwards, I'm attending community college to get an associates in networking. Then, I will transfer to a 4 year university to finish bachelors. In the meantime, I want to work in IT to gain experience. Is this plan realistic?"

I'm about to graduate with a first-honours BSc in CS from a reputable English University. I've done a placement year as part of the degree at an antivirus company, working on the antivirus engine, followed by an internship at the same place. However, I feel like my interest in software dev has peaked in high school! Seeing how half of the year was better than me at programming, I basically gave up trying in the first year, massively relying on what I had learnt during high school (general algs and data structures in C). The entire degree was a bit weird, I feel like I got a good classification solely by knowing what to study for each module and picking modules with closed assessments (so not much programming required). I did my best to avoid any sort of programming, as I felt my skills were inadequate compared to my peers'. 

Now I'm returning for a SE level 2 position at said antivirus company and I can't feel more of a fraud. During my placement I burnt out, which continued during my final year and I have just managed to get myself together in the past few months. I am really scared of going bck to work and feeling inadequate and stupid and unskilled. 

I don't know what else I'd do, I think I'm interested in biology, but I'm not sure enough to invest my resources in some masters degree. 

Anyone has gone through something similar? Even if not, anyone got any advice?"
6k2zct,3,2017-06-28,Choosing between multiple opportunities,mr_scoT5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6k2zct/choosing_between_multiple_opportunities/,"So after months of applying I finally have some other employment options.

Currently working as an analyst (W2, no benefits) at a large beer company. Been here for 1.5 yrs with no raise and the work is generally easy but boring. Tried to go FTE in the past but was rejected due to I what I believe was a personality conflict with the old manager (she is extremely extroverted, I am not). Now I have a new manager and am competitive for a FTE opening. 

Applied and received good feedback on my Excel test. Not sure what the timeline for hiring is, but I'll be finding that out in a meeting with the manager tomorrow. So that's opportunity 1. I get along with my coworkers but am not really friends with any them. It's basically the same job I am doing now (probably w/ a bit more responsibility) but w/ higher pay and benefits (2 weeks vacation, good insurance, gym access, free beer).

-----

Opportunity 2 (and so far the only actual offer) is at a Fortune 100 company (manufacturing/technology industry). I'd be working in more of an IT role doing mobile device management. This  would be a 12 month W2 contract w/ no benefits (but a 25% raise over what I'm currently making). Recruiter claims it will convert to FTE after the contract is up. 

First talked with the company over a month ago but after 2 weeks of radio silence, received an offer yesterday. I have 5 days to accept and they want me to start July 17th or 24th. I haven't worked in IT before so it seems like I'd learn a lot here and open myself up to some lucrative opportunities down the line (apparently there is shortage of workers experienced w/ MDM). My concern with this opportunity is that my only contact with the people I'd work with was a 30min interview. That's it. I talked with the recruiter today and asked about setting up a quick in-person meeting but he was kinda iffy about it. So feels a little bit like buying a used car over the internet, sight unseen. 

----

Opportunity 3 is w/ a privately held aerospace/defense contractor company. The job would be a FTE project analyst working with a NASA affiliated division that helps resupply the ISS. Now tbh, I don't really care about space stuff but I would love to work alongside engineers (i.e. people smarter than my beer-company colleagues). 

So far all I know about the role is from a 20 minute call with the hiring manager. We both went to the same school and did the same internship, so that's probably why I was selected for an interview. Scheduled for July 12th, well after the accept deadline for opportunity 2. Compensation wise it'd be similar to a FTE role at the beer company, but with better benefits (extra week of vacation, generous 401k match, every other Friday off).

----

**TLDR: What do I do?**
I believe there's a good chance I'll get an offer from the beer company, the aerospace company is an unknown at this time. So to hedge my options, I basically need to accept opportunity 2 and then bail on it if/when I get an offer from the others. "

I'll try to describe myself and my job search approach a little and if anyone has helpful advice I'd love to hear it.

I'm currently in a Masters Program for Data Analytics and I live in NYC. I would consider my masters more math than anything else, like nothing is taught about programming just algorithms and math. I have the basic python foundations for data science (numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib). I've applied to 60 positions, all through indeed (I really like the job search organization they have). I got 3 call for phone interview in the past 2 month, one for data engineer intern and 2 for data analyst intern (2 were unpaid), yet no offer. I don't know what I'm missing. I have an econ undergrad, still many of the many financial or economics data analyst position have not reached out. I have 2 projects up on github of Machine Learning classification (what I did in class). In it I implemented 2 different algorithms from scratch, and 2 in sklearn and few visualizations.

Am I applying enough? Can I Apply smarter?
Application, takes more time than you would think, a lot of filling things out that are already in my resume, and a lot of small BS that adds up. Do people usually follow up if they didn't hear back from the company? How would I go about doing that? What sources besides indeed should I apply though? Are they any better?

What side projects? How many side projects?
I would dedicate more time to projects, but I really prefer just getting into something first and worrying about side projects when I have actual position. I'm currently working on the Kaggle Zillow Zestimate challange but Its a super messy and weird dataset and I don't know if the time investment is worth it, or should I use that time in applying more. I have some other things, like an implementation of simplex algorithm on 6 by 6 play data set to optimize a salad ingredients, and an idea for a new ensemble model which my professor just dictate it to me and I typed it up (it's pretty substantial with 200 lines, but I think it could've been done in less since the code is a bit sloppy). I'm not sure if they should be considered projects to put on github.

What positions should I apply to?
I'm not getting any calls from data science position but I am getting calls for data analyst (though a sample size of 3 is too small to base that off). At the same time my masters is preparing me more for roles relevant to Machine learning than whatever Data Analysts do. The data analyst didn't even understand some of the things I was talking about when talking about my projects. He was more interested in me building interactive visualizations and dashboards (which has nothing to do with what Iv'e learned so far).

Also, I know that I'm pretty close to qualified, if I'm not there yet. I know people similar coding ability and less math and machine learning understanding than me in data engineer internships, data analyst internships and etc. Sorry for ranting, but some thoughtful constructive criticism would be appropriated."

I've recently graduated from a state university with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. No internship experience - only class projects and freelancing. It's been roughly 1 month since I graduated and I've been bouncing around the internet for jobs. Since then, I've been narrowed to 2 choices:


- 1) There's a job close by my house that's in my field of expertise and I really want to get. I applied in early June and they say that there currently installing some new equipment and they would call me back at the end of this month. Well...I called them today at the end of June and they said that they'll get back to me!


- 2) However, there's another job that's waiting for me. As of now, they're waiting my reply as to whether I would take it. While it is not in an industry I'm experienced with, I would be open to learning it. However, it is extremely far away from where I live and it demands that I stay in that company for quite some time. The commute is basically 40 minutes there and back home in LA traffic.


My problem is...what do I do? 

Do I continue to wait patiently for my dream job to call me back to interview me? 

Or do I accept this new job that I've no experience in (but I hold an interest in and am willing to learn), but consist of long commutes (40 minutes to and from in LA traffic, I know), possible relocation, and me  being in that company for quite some time.

Or do I continue job hunting? I know I can't wait for that interview forever, but I also desperately want to join to workforce.

I would appreciate any advice. Thank you for listening!"

I am good enough at math and data analysis but I have not particularly enjoyed those classes and I do not know what to expect from a career as a data analyst. I understand some things about myself that might help me make a decision: I like being on my feet, moving around, socializing/talking to people, etc. but I don't know how to take that information and do something with it. I am thinking about grad school since it could help me stand out( maybe in economics or business) but I don't want to go into the wrong program not knowing what I want to do.

They are currently looking to hire another tier 1 employee, what I am currently doing, and I am thinking about throwing my hat in the mix. I am currently making $16 an hour and have been told the full time tier 1 start at $18-$20. I'm not really sure if I'd want to work with the NOC for my entire career but I feel like it is giving me a good overview of IT and I wouldn't mind working it while I finished my degree.

The issue is I would have to delay my graduation by at least a semester, maybe just the summer semester if I get my schedule situated. My question is it worth it? Would delaying my graduation by 6 months to a year be worth coming out of college with about 6 months of Desktop Support experience and a year of NOC experience?

6k5i53,2,2017-06-28,Offer between Industry and Big 4,tacguac,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/6k5i53/offer_between_industry_and_big_4/,"I have been a co-op at a utility company for almost 1.8 months, and last month I got hired in as a finance associate after my graduation (my GPA is 3.72). While I was a co-op at the utility company, I got an offer to intern at a big 4 accounting firm over the summer, and my manager allowed me to go for two months and come back. I got an offer from the big 4 firm to start working in October of this year in New York City. The reason why it is NYC is that I want to work eventually break into banking.
Since my start date at the big 4 firm is in October of this year, I asked them to push it to next year that way I can pass my CPA and save up some money before I move. When I first got the offer I was extremely excited to work in a big city and to have many doors for opportunities down the road. 
Now that I have been thinking more about it, I am hesitant to move. The starting salary in NYC is a bit higher than what I am currently making at my current firm, but it is not that high that you can live comfortably (the budget will be tight). The cons of NYC is the high cost of living. I live in Michigan so everything here is decently priced and with work you can have a good quality of life. I know for sure that my quality of life in NYC is going to be like crap, but I got used to living like that. I am also not a traditional student, I am immigrant who moved from another country with 4k in my pocket back in 2012. I had to walk to school and work because I didn't have a car and the public transportation in the suburbs of Detroit just sucks. I have always struggled financially and still am struggling because everything that I would make would go towards supporting my mom and myself (my mom is older and sick and doesn't speak English). So since I moved here, I have always been working 40+ hours and taking classes. I didn't have the basic things that most of my friends have such as a house, money, car (I have a car now), etc... allowing them to focus on school and internships rather than stressing about how to make ends meet at the end of the month. You stress out the most when you realize you have so much to pay for yet you make so little.
After working at small local businesses when I first moved here, I had to do something about my life, so I was able to land a co-op at my current job and then an internship at a big 4 firm. 

Pros of working at my current company:
-stability and good pay
-ability to buy a house since I have been living in a flat since I moved to the US
-save money 
-great benefits
-stay with my mom (I don't have family in the US)

Cons:
-fewer opportunities for diverse experience
-less travel
-harder career progression 
-harder to get into financial services

Pros of working at big 4 in NYC:
-Experience
-opportunities
-networking
-great benefits

Cons:
-cost of living
-pay isn't enough for a comfortable living in NYC
-what am I going to do with my mom?

I noticed that most people who work in public accounting firms leave after two to three years. Many can't handle it, and many can't make it past senior, so they switch to industry. If I do move from industry to big 4, I will lose seniority because I would have already worked there for 3 years compared to starting as staff 1 at a big 4.
I know that the right thing to do is to stay at the utility company, buy a house for my mom and myself, save up money, and later do my MBA at a good school, move on from there, and see what I want to do with my career. Unfortunately, my anxiety and the what if question will haunt me if I don't do public accounting. (and all my acquaintances from school; yes they are not friends because all they do is show off and be assholes to each other and I would much rather spend my time alone than with some ignorant folks) (I have friends).

Maybe I should ask the public accounting firm to move the offer to Michigan, but at the end of the day is it worth it? 

Don't get me wrong, I am very driven and motivated, and I don't want to get too comfortable and relax. I want to challenge myself and achieve great things. But I want to make the right decision.

I just need some genuine advice on what is more reasonable to do.

While I went to every class, did my work, studied, etc there was just some things that were missing. For example, for the first four semesters of my college career I relied heavily on my advisor to create my class schedule for each semester instead of doing it myself. Secondly, I didn't even know the requirements to get into my major, in fact I didn't even know that you had to be accepted into the business college until the end of my fourth semester when my advisor told me. I had to take two English composition courses and a speech class over the summer to fulfill the requirements. This was after my sophomore year btw. Thirdly, I didn't know that a 2 hour delay at college meant that only the first two classes were cancelled. I thought that my 10am and 11am classes met at 12pm and 1pm respectively. I missed both of those classes that day, but luckily there were lectures posted on blackboard so I didn't really have to worry. 
It took getting a 2.7 after 3 semesters of college for me to really kick myself into 5th gear. The possibility of not being able to find a job (or even an internship) in my field became a very real one and that was enough for me to get my stuff together. I now have a 3.6 and am going for my CPA. "

Unfortunately I don't have a internship this summer, but I do have some time on my hands. So far in my CS career I haven't really focused into any area of CS, taking a smattering of this and that (AI, Networking, etc). I figure now is a good time (if not a bit on the later side) to try and beef up the basics (for just general job hunting) as well as try and get some specialized experience (working on some sort of project).

To this end, im looking for solid resources for learning more about AI. If anyone knows of any textbooks or websites that do an awesome job teaching AI concepts I'd love to hear about it. I've taken some courses but I realize that really I've only scratched the surface.

As well, if anyone has good advice on the types of projects that are most effective in terms of giving you hard skills, looking reasonable on a resume, and don't require a abundance of overhead I'd love to hear about it. My current gameplan was to just try to learn as much as I could about a topic then try to whip up an android app that incorporated what I learned, but I recognize that very possibly there are better ways to go about choosing a project.

Finally, any advice to a soon to be graduated student would be deeply appreciated. I only have a quarter left, so taking different sorts of classes and such is going to be difficult, but obviously I can independently attempt to learn as much as possible. Currently im looking at cracking the coding interview, as well as doing leetcode and hackerrank challenges but again im by no means confident that there is not possibly more effective means of studying for upcoming interviews. As well, if anyone knows of any learning resources that are awesome that aren't even for AI I'd love to hear about it. I feel like im at a bit of a crossroads in terms of trying to gain more specialized knowledge so hearing more about possible paths would be great

We have spotty satellite internet that is very slow since we live in a rural area about 20 minutes outta the nearest town. I haven't coded anything since getting out of college.

Right now I can barely afford to live, I pay all my money for rent and my student loans and car stuff and living expenses and only have about $30 a week or so to my name so it's hard for me to buy anything."

I was admitted to both UC Davis and University of Toronto for undergrad majoring in Computer Science. I am a Canadian currently living in California. I'm struggling to choose between these two schools because they are both prestigious and have their own Pros and Cons. Some pros of Davis is that I would be closer to my family and a much larger internship opportunity/job market. 
some pros about Toronto are it is a more well known school and better research opportunities but a crappy job market in Toronto.

I went to a top tier engineering school in California, graduated with a mechanical engineering degree last June, took an internship abroad for a few months, and have literally been looking for work ever since. I've been actively looking in CA, but it seems there is just too much competition. 

In the meantime, I tutored, am studying for the GRE, and brushing up on programming as I want to pursue a career in robotics and research/research &amp; development. 

But I've gotten very demoralized these past few months. This process has quite honestly drained my energy, passion, and enthusiasm for the field. It has also caused too many days of depression and feeling completely worthless. I also just feel lost. I have lots of dreams and would have never imagined myself in this position one year ago. It has drastically decreased my optimism for reaching my full potential and pursuing my desired career path. Maybe I'm approaching things in the wrong way, maybe I should be doing things differently. I'm not sure.

Do you have any suggestions for me? How can I be successful in my job search? What should I be doing in the mean time to not become numb to this feeling of uselessness, to gain important skills?"

I am bored almost all day long as I spend 20% of my days working (it might be even less, I'd rather not count exactly how many hours a day it really is) and 80% pretending to work. Because yes, if I could do whatever I want when I have nothing to work on, I'd be glad to read books online or read articles, but as there are people behind me in the office, I have to pretend to work and that's definitely the worst part : Opening files, pretending to read numbers, writing some fake report, deleting it and re-writing it, etc.. Just kill me now.

I'm going to look for another job but I'm scared it might be exactly the same anywhere else as it was exactly the same during my internship. I'm a junior so that might be an explanation but I'm afraid it's not. Office jobs seem to be so boring, I don't see anyone at work who seems to like what they're doing.

Now Summer is coming and my load of work might actually have my days filled with only 5% of actual work and 95% or boredom for the 2 months to come. I'd rather be unemployed than keep going like this for 40 years.

And boredom is wearying. I don't know how that can be true but when I come home after 8 hours of pretending to work, I feel super tired to the point that the only thing I want is to go to sleep.

The more I think about it, the more uncertain I feel about my future in the world of work.

It's a bit long winded but I needed to get this out.

I transferred into the university I'm studying at in Fall 2016. I took four years in JC due to personal and academic issues that had to be worked out. I don't regret taking that long. I changed majors upon transferring, and it's gonna take me one more year to graduate (2019 instead of 2018).

I did everything necessary to integrate into my new life at my uni. I did Greek life, joined some clubs, became part of the multicultural greek council and I took on more positions in my org. I am also doing an internship related to my major, and plan on being more active in my major. 

I still feel that I don't belong. 

My university is based in LA and everyone commutes from different parts of LA.. some as far as Temecula (holy shit). 

I feel alone. I feel that I don't fit in. People in LA seem to be more appearance based. I don't feel genuine connections. I feel that I'm becoming more pessimistic and cynical. Maybe even gossipy. Basically someone I worked so hard to not become.

 My hometown is a cozy beach town, 2 hours up north. Everyone knows each other, and is pretty friendly. I had genuine connections with people. I was under the radar, so I avoided all the drama that came with being ""popular"". Everything is within walking distance. There's a uni too! I just didn't want to stay home because I thought I wanted to live the city life. I don't know why, but I feel that I'm closer with my two best friends back home, than with the people in my org. I'm usually alone in my down time. No one but one person goes out of their way to hang out with me. And when I make plans, I feel like no one wants to come through. 

I know that opportunities for my major are scarce back home. But I really just want to be back. I miss my family, my friends and my hometown. I miss how it wasn't so hard to hang out with a group of friends. Or that if my friends were busy, my little sister was there. I am in a LTR, and he's also a big reason why I want to be home. I feel that I grew into myself during my time in LA, and that I'm ready to go back home to show everyone I'm different and put in work..


Is this a normal feeling? Will it ever go away? I don't like feeling this way anymore. I'm starting to feel depressed and anxious..
Does anyone have advice? TIA

I am an international PhD student who will start their 2nd year of PhD this fall. I am in a pretty decent university on the east coast.

I have absolutely zero experience in the industry, which means that I also have no experience in mobile/web development etc. I just dont know JS (and frameworks), HTML, MySQL, android/iOS programming etc, otherwise my programming is pretty good as far as C/C++, java, algorithm implementation is concerned.

I have basically worked in Systems e.g OS (minus the Database areas), software security etc. during my undergrad and during the first year of my PhD. I also took an ECE dept course in embedded systems (I liked it) but could not pursue it further because ECE credits dont count towards CS degrees. 

I dont feel like my expertise is good enough for what might be needed in the industry because academic focus is not on tools, languages etc but rather on theory.

Coming to the point. 

I feel like I will just leave with a MS degree instead of the PhD and hence I have started preparing algorithms and programming interview questions.

I dont want to join a ""normal"" software engineer position but something specialized e.g. something related to OS or software security etc.

Some personal context:
I'm a CS student about a year from graduating, former liberal studies student. I ditched Liberal Studies for a few reasons. Teachers make crap money, I developed a lack of patience for kids and even more so for those (admittedly rarer than people make them) stupid parents. So I switched to CS. Why, because I wanted a STEM degree for the challenge, computers fit in with my interests, the money, job opportunities, stability, and maturity of the industry (although I'm sure some would argue elementary school kids are more mature than programmers). And of course I can't deny the catalyst for it all, video games. Young dude, free time spent on consoles from Playstation 1 to Gamecube to Xbox 360 to PS4 (and most handhelds in between). Making video games for a living sounded fun and CS was the way in according to a few professors. 

Since then, I've learned how naive I was thinking the game industry would be as fun as I thought. I've heard horror stories of overworked developers slaving to the needs of producers who didn't know a variable from a value. I've heard of game developers losing their jobs left and right as each game is finished, as if the position was expendable contract work or something. I've heard of cruddy and toxic environments where one works on things entirely void of the luster that the game industry once gleamed to them.

Just put together a parts list for my potential first build. I have an internship for the summer that's paying fairly well so I decided to put some of that money towards a PC. I plan on using it mostly for gaming purposes, hopefully at 1440p once I can get a new monitor (probably waiting to get this later). For now I will just be on 1080p with a monitor I already have that isn't very special. I'm not really looking to overclock or anything yet since I don't really have the know how to do it, so I didn't go with a water-cooled system. 

I'm posting this here since this is my first build and I'm not 100% on everything I would need. If there is anything else I would possibly need or anything that would be more compatible with my current parts it would be great to know.

Here is the parts list:

I have a quarter left at UCLA and started to apply for some ""entry-level"" software engineer positions. 

My CS background:

I have taking the basic lower division CS courses like data structures, computer organization(assembly, architecture, etc), and I have taken upper division courses in operating systems, programming languages, databases, and algorithms.

For math, I have taken as many ""CS-related"" classes like optimization, numerical methods, probability, graph theory, etc

My GPA is pretty low &gt;3.0 (taking so many Math and Computer Science courses per quarter was not great for my GPA).
Obviously I don't have a degree in Computer Science, so I was considering a M.S. in Computer Science (which is a rather expensive option). I haven't don't any real side projects outside the projects I did for my CS courses nor have any work experience, and haven't really networked. I would appreciate some advise on how I should productively spend my summer and my last quarter in school. My goal is to be employed before graduating in December (hopefully as a software engineer).

Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;

Company 1 is for Tata Consultancy Service.

&amp;nbsp;

Pros

- They work with technologies that align better with the career I want. (Java, .NET, Cloud Platforms, MERN stack, etc)
- They have offices around the US, and are giving me a relocation package to a city I want to move to
- I want to stay there a year at most, and then jump ship to a better company

Cons

- Lower salary 
- Bad reputation based on what I've read on Reddit

&amp;nbsp;

Company 2 is rapidly growing in its own field. I don't want to name them specifically because they are pretty small.

&amp;nbsp;

Pros

- Higher salary
- Potential for growth is really high at the company, and could be making six figures within a few years
- Good benefits
- Excellent reviews on GlassDoor and everywhere else I've read

Cons

- Most of the work is not really software development, and I won't be touching code
- I had a very similar job for my internship, and I really hated it
- If I leave, I fear that my skill set won't be marketable as a software engineer because what they do is really esoteric and irrelevant to most positions.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been on the job search for a little over 6 months, and I was losing hope. I finally receive 2 offer, but the one I will take will probably have a longterm effect on my career. Financially, I don't have any major debt or obligations. My parent's have been really supportive, and don't mind that I stay at home for as long as I need to, but I feel like I should jump on an opportunity because I hate being dependent on them.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I go for Company 2 because of the money and benefits? Should I rough it out at Company 1 for a year? Or should I just keep on searching for something I like?

Edit: 
Woah, I need to fix the formatting... hold on."

6kdv8a,7,2017-06-30,"Internship employer wants me to stay on part time for the fall semester, should I ask for a raise?",byebyebiosphere,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6kdv8a/internship_employer_wants_me_to_stay_on_part_time/,"I'm currently working at an internship over the summer semester. I enjoy it and have been learning a lot about how a software company actually works and some of their software development processes. I get to write code in Python, and I'm pretty sure there are a couple projects with other frameworks I'd be working on if I stayed. 


I'm being paid $12 / hour right now for the internship. **Is it unreasonable to ask for $19 / hour to stay on for the Fall?**


My justifications are that:

 
1. I am providing real value to the company. 
2. This would no longer be in the time-range of the previously agreed upon internship. 
3. They were recently looking to hire a full-time receptionist with a salary in the 30-37k range, which broken down into 40 hr work-week is $14.4-$17.8 per hour. $19/hr pay would put me in the range of 39.5k salary, which I think is reasonable since I believe I am providing at least as much value to the company as the receptionist (since I've been significantly contributing on some high paying projects over this summer).
4. Working part time and doing school full-time is much more difficult than just doing school full-time. If I look at this as an opportunity cost, I would want to be reasonably compensated for me to sacrifice focus on school to work for them.


What do you guys think, am I being unreasonable? 


What's the best way to bring this up and negotiate?
 

As of right now, I told my manager that I wasn't sure about staying on for this Fall semester because of my commitment to school, and that I'll make a decision soon and let him know. 


Thoughts?


Thank in advance!"

Until I'm financially independent and have paid him back for all he's given me, I'm not allowed to question, disobey, or god forbid talk back to him (cause it's apparently worse than disobeying him?). 

Long story short (jk not that short), my dad started ignoring me when i was in 8th grade up until I left for college. He didn't tell me why; he just did. Whenever I talked to him, he'd glare at me while ignoring me, and then continue whatever it is he was doing. When I was struggling in school, he'd only make it worse. I used to spend most nights crying in the bathroom with the shower running. My mom and my sister kept telling me he loves me etc. but there was no way I could bring myself to believe it. When my mom would force us to take a family picture together on my birthday, I'd fight back tears cause being able to be so close to my dad made me both nervous and happy. 

The worst would be when my mom would leave for a couple days for family business. It was absolute silence the entire time she was gone. 

When I started receiving acceptance letters from decently good colleges, my dad then decided that he was no longer going to ignore me and pretended as if everything was normal again. I just finished my second year of college but I still think about those five years and it still hurts. 

I came home this summer for an internship and we got into an argument (over something super trivial). Admittedly, I talked back to him (because it was so trivial) and he told me I had no place in his home and he hated me. He threatened that if I spoke to him again like that, he'd kick me out. He said that I wasn't grateful for the 20 years of unconditional love he gave me. I honestly wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh. My mom thinks he went over but our family dynamic doesn't allow her to question him either.

I wanted to remind him of the five years when he ignored me. I wanted him to know how I cried almost every night. But I'm still far from being financially independent (parents refuse to let me get a job) so whatever am I right? "

I'll try to make this brief while still being thorough.  I'm a 23 year old male currently entering my final year of undergrad (electrical engineering).  It's been a tough road, partly from depression, partly from realizing that I'm not crazy about my major.

In 12-18 months, I would like to attend graduate school in Brazil at either the University of São Paulo, or Unicamp, both high echelon schools.  I want to pursue (Ma or PhD, undecided) in Computer Science with a strong focus on Machine Learning.  While there, I would like to train a  martial art, BJJ or boxing.  

Throughout undergrad I've consistently done better and enjoyed my CS classes much more than ECE, and as such think I would enjoy the material much more if it were my focus.  I'm from a very poor background, but I've made it this far, and I've determined that this is the sum of what I am most interested in, in this life.

###Where I'm At So Far

* I've been self-teaching Portuguese for the past 9 months.  I've finished Duolingo and now use a host of other apps, books, and talk to natives online every day.  At this point I'm spending at least 3 hours of my day in Portuguese, but this flunctuates.

* I created a Github and started an AI project.  It's not nearly done yet, but I hope to finish it this month and add many similar projects in the future, possibly blogging about them regularly.

* I have some pretty decent programming experience, especially in Python.  As well as 4 months internship experience.

* I began reading some Machine Learning textbooks when I go to bed.  Progress is slow.

* I historically score high on standardized tests.

* I have a pretty intense workout regimen that's about 50/50 on strength training and conditioning.

* I've got $800 in savings, $60 in stocks, and $141 in cryptocurrencies.  I also own hardware that I'm mining crypto with that is netting me $10-$20 per day, depending on the market.  Last year my credit score was in the high 700s.

###Obstacles

* My GPA is dogshit, I've got 30ish credits left and I'm sitting on a 2.6.  It's a self feeding cycle of getting hopeless about improving my grades and then getting worse grades.

* I will have roughly $65k in student loans when I graduate next year.

* I currently have $10k in credit card debt, partially from missed work during a depressive episode I had, partially from shitty decisions.  The majority of that is on a credit card that will not begin accruing interest until December.  Its sort of out of hand.

* I can't afford to go to a BJJ gym here and there's literally no boxing gyms.  I have no technical skills in either.

* I'm currently making minimum wage at a campus job.


I feel like I'm doing some good towards what I want to do, but I have no idea if it's the best way, or if my goals are even realistic.  Is this even a good idea? Am I going to fuck myself trying to pursue this? The financial situation is the most concerning, although, college is *free* at the institutions I specified.  

Could anyone shed some light on what I need to do, starting today?

tl;dr How do I get to a great graduate school in Brazil with a shit gpa and a decent amount of debt?"

If it is important I'm a 22 year old male college student in the States.

I was recently shopping at the mall for some stuff for my buddies wedding. I ended up getting everything except a new belt for my suit because I can't find a store that sells leather belts without a buckle or with a removable buckle so I can put my lucky belt buckle that I got from my grandpa on it, I was also wearing my lucky shoes that I got from him and are the nicest leather shoes I have ever owned.

I go to a bunch of stores and cannot find a single belt that fits this criteria, I honestly didn't think it would be that difficult to find. Anyways, I see the store ""Buckle"" and I think in my head that it was like denim and would have belts, because you know the name. 

I go into the store and I see that my assumption was extremely wrong and the store does not seem to carry any belts or buckles. Shit. I do see a small section with belts and head over there, where the cutest goddamn blonde I have ever laid eyes on walks up and asks if she can help me with anything. And I start to explain my dilemma as I look at the belts, we find one that does have a removable buckle but it looks like a affliction or Ed hardy shirt made on a leather strip. I explain it won't really go with a suit for a wedding and she goes to look online and see if she can find it but can't tell if they have removable buckles. So we chit chat for a bit and she suggests going to check out a leather store she knew of and off I go
As I go she jokingly was saying about come in anytime to see her because she basically lives there. I decide to check at a work wear store across the street and find one. I decide to put the belt buckle on the belt and go back in. 

I head back into the mall, take a deep as breath and walk into the Buckle store, I see her talking with her two coworkers and she sees me and asks if I was able to find one, I say yes I was and we chit chat about it being weird they didn't have it at any of the other stores in the mall and that she would keep note of it being there in case anyone else wanted something similar. 

We talk about silly stuff about belts for a bit and I can tell the conversation is dying down but honestly I want to keep talking to this gorgeous woman. So I tell her I actually needed to get some clothes for the 4th and saw when I was in before that they had some patriotic and alcoholic shirts. And we walk over to that section and start looking at the availiable beer shirts and then start talking about drinks and then plans for the 4th, I tell her it's my first time being back around my family because I've traveled for the 4th the last few years and was probably going to barbeque, drink beer and probably blow some stuff up. She says she thinks she  works during the day but gets off around 4 and sadly has nothing to do. Here is where I feel I missed the first opportunity to be smooth and confident by asking her to come celebrate with me but that is way too bold for me and honestly I was just a little in awe most of this time. 

She is the first to compliment me by saying I look like I am dressed very fancy and what I do for work and I said I am actually down here waiting for my evening class as I am a student, but that I actually did just start my new job/internship with the fancy title of Biology Technician on the military base nearby. My dumb ass forgot to brag about the fact that I'm also becoming a wildland firefighter... 

She asked what I was studying and what I actually did at this internship and so I explained I had just spent the week doing timber sales and looking for raptors, birds, invasive species around logging operations and she starts into a story about hating pocket gophers. It was about her parents replacing the mobile home on their property a few years ago and how after they got rid of the old house and have the new one placed the department of ecology stopped the move because it was supposedly breeding grounds for pocket gophers and no construction would be able to happen and her parents were stuck living in her apartment for over 6 months.

I remember the whole story because of how damn transfixed on her beauty I was.

 A bunch more small talk after this I end having already bought a pair of sandals because a quarter of the way into this because, honestly I needed an excuse to keep talking to her. 

We keep talking about stuff, whose wedding it is me saying I couldn't do retail and her saying that I could with how I talk to people and how nice I am, she jokes again about always being at work and basically living there, I said so the bed in back is yours and she says yeah the mattress over by the dumpsters, some Febreeze jokes follow. I start heading to leave because I'm too retarded to make a move, strike three. 

She says to come back and visit her since she basically lives there and that she would love to see me again. As I walk away she is talking about if I need to get shirts or jeans that they have jeans and to come in to get them. 

This happened on Wednesday and I didn't realize until Thursday morning driving to work that her name was Alex.

 My buddy who is going to get married the Saturday after the 4ths name... Alex. 

The belt buckle given to me by my grandfather who raised me for much of my childhood, that is the reason I walked into that store that day is white gold with a letter ""A"" for Augustus and now Anderson.


So guys what do I do? I was thinking of going in tomorrow or possibly Monday and asking her to either celebrate the 4th with me or come to my friends wedding if she is available and if not to go get lunch or dinner with me.

Would that be creepy or inappropriate? Is this how people meet people as adults? Should I feel this confident about going to talk to her?

What do I do?!

Tl;Dr I'm either crazy or just had a lot of luck.

I lean more toward the latter, but I want to know if it's really worth it to go there. Here's some information about me: 

- Intended CS major

- may want to go to grad school for either business or CS

- I've talked to my parents and they can afford to send me there full price without loans or aid. And they are willing to.

I know everyone says your school doesn't matter for CS, but I feel like it does. My state school (SUNY Buffalo) is notorious for having poor and unhelpful career services and a lack of opportunities for internships. I know it's so much cheaper, but NEU looks like it has so many more opportunities in terms of experiential learning and coursework available. I also know that the conventional wisdom is to go to your cheapest option if you're planning on grad school, but I feel like an education at NEU will prepare me so much better for it than at my state school.

So here is some backstory.
- I live in the UK
- I graduated from University in 2016 with a 2.1 in BA(Hons) Accounting and Management.
- I have been searching for a graduate job since I left university and have applied to over 100 jobs.
-I am applying for general business graduate schemes (rotational things), project management roles, business development, and some sales related jobs.
- I have had a few interviews/assessment days, even sometimes making it to the final stages.

I think one of the weak points on my CV is that I don't have a lot of experience for the roles I am applying for. And so I have also been applying to a lot of internships.
I have had no success with these either.

Is there some other way that I can get experience, or is there something that I am doing wrong?

I'm delighted and really looking forward to it, but a bit nervous about it all. I'll be working mainly on app development primarily using React native. Now here's the thing. I do have some basic experience with JavaScript, but being honest there's a lot I don't know. The company know this and they don't expect me to know everything about JavaScript, React Native etc. They have stated that they will train me up to their standard essentially, which is fine, but I don't want to go in there knowing nothing, I really want to make an impression. So what I am asking basically in this post is for some advice and guidance on what to know, and what I should read up on before I start! Also any general tips on starting work as a developer. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
6kfrrb,7,2017-06-30,Informatics and major choosing,amarvdnt,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/6kfrrb/informatics_and_major_choosing/,"Currently a CC student set on doing TAG for UCI, I was absolutely stoked after I toured last month. I pretty much know at this point that I like coding to an extent but learning CS and becoming a software dev for a Fortune 500 is not really what I want to do. I've talked to acquaintances in business analyst roles and more IT-sided work like QA/testing and I've really liked what I've heard. I'm also doing SQL-related work in my internship and am enjoying that as well. My question, mainly for informatics majors or people in the industry– would informatics (with a specialization in organization and IT) be the best choice for me to apply to UCI as, or should I apply CS and choose informatics as an alternate in the official UC app to broaden my career prospects? Because broadening my career prospects would be the only compelling reason for me to do CS. I have no interest in actually learning how computers work and how math/algorithms apply.

Another question- if I'm well-qualified for informatics, would it be more likely for me to get into the program by applying for informatics as my first choice major, or would I have just as good of a shot if I apply for it as an alternate major in the UC app, assuming I apply CS for my first choice and don't get in for CS?

tl;dr - wanna do IT work after I graduate, fairly fond of coding, don't *really* like CS, is informatics a good middle ground? or should I choose CS for jobs/$$ ? also, first choice for major: CS, alternate choice: informatics or first choice: informatics, forget CS?"

2) What specific skills do you hope to learn in the United States that you would not learn in your home country or another foreign country?

After taking a couple web related classes, for backend, I have learned to use java and php while frontend I have used the usual html, css, and javascript (jquery too). 

Right now I'm about to enter my 5th week of internship and the company that I'm with have been using C# for backend. 

Now I'm wondering what languages do other companies use for web applications and what would be the best one to pick up? Hopefully the most popular one? I understand choosing a language is about preference and such but I just wanna know what language will increase my chances of being hired.

Tl;dr - what language will give you more of a chance to land you a job as a web developer"

I got into a private uni to get a MS in CS (decent computer science school in big urban city) and I start my first class in January after taking a few discrete math and data structures prereqs through MOOCs this summer (crazy they let me do that tbh).

Anyways, I will be studying part-time while holding an analyst or accounting position after I graduate with my bachelors and when I start my masters. It'll be 1 class per quarter (4 quarters in a year). I should be done with the MS in 2-2.5 years. 

I don't really know how to code well except some VBA and a bit of Java. Hoping after I finish the data structures prereq I'll know Java a bit better. My question is, at what point should I start applying for CS jobs and/or internships during my part-time MS program? Thank you."

The issue is I don't know with 100% certainty which field within compsci I ultimately want to end up working in; Is this normal? I know one can't really go wrong with cybersecurity, but I haven't looked into to many fields beyond that. Did most of you not know what you were going to end up doing until you actually got hired? Also, what things can I do on the side while in school to increase my attractiveness as a potential hire to employers? Here's some things that I think might help increase my chances of being hired:

- Personal Projects
- Collaborating with others on group projects online
- Obtaining IT and cyber-security certifications (even though I'm not necessarily 100% stuck on doing something cyber-security related
- Going to hackathons
- Networking
- Internships
- Establishing good relationships with professors and possibly becoming a teacher's assistant
- Establishing good relationships with fellow students

Is there anything I'm missing here? Are any of the items on this list not worth the effort?"
6khuzv,10,2017-06-30,is it normal that i have not found an internship,Ayakhle,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/6khuzv/is_it_normal_that_i_have_not_found_an_internship/,"So let me start by saying this. I'm a student studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science and I was in COOP. Unfortunately, despite the tremendous amount of effort that I had put in in order to find an internship this summer, I did not manage to secure a work term and therefore was forced to drop COOP because I could not afford to take summer classes. I had applied to about 200 jobs through COMPASS, Indeed and LinkedIn. I managed to land a few interviews (about 4) but never got a job offer. I find it very disappointing because I thought that I'd be able to find a job for sure.

I spoke to someone at COOP and they had mentioned that I could reapply for the INEX program and gave me a business card so I could e-mail the person for the right information.

I feel quite a bit disappointed, had I not put much effort, I would blame myself, but that wasn't the case and all of my friends got an internship. I feel like I'm wasting time this way and could have had the opportunity to gain some hands on experience in the field. Has anyone ever experienced this? What can I do in order to better myself and actually get an internship?"

The first interview was a phone interview for 30 minutes and it went very well. They decided to have me onsite and I interviewed with 4 managers for 30 minutes each.  I struggled with anxiety the day of the interview and was not my best. First interview went okay and she mentioned that this interview should be easy.  My voice sounded weird and the 2nd interviewer even brought a box of tissues because I mentioned I had a stuffy nose so I could blow my nose half way through the interview.  I also wasnt clear with a couple answers. The interview with the 3rd person ended about 5 minutes early and she mentioned that its good that Im getting experience interviewing with other companies I did not get a good vibe from her.  The last interviewer mentioned the benefits of working at the company but did not mention the next steps in the process. He did say a couple times ""if you get the job"". I mentioned to him that I had personal issues the night before and he said he only wants to see if I have the skills for the position and hinted that he doesnt care if my voice is weird today. They did really like my resume and cover letter and hinted that I was more experienced than the average intern.  Do you think I can still get the job after not being my best for the 2nd interview."
