I am a co-founder and I posted details about our company in July hiring thread https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3bqjfr/rindia_july_hiring_thread/. 

Even before that, we got an awesome intern (who interned with us and now works part time for us &amp; never forgets to join in our parties). So after posting in that hiring thread, few people reached out to us. We do have a long drawn hiring process and few actually made it through the whole process. 

Results - 

1) 6 people reached out to me.

2) 3 took the process forward.

3) 2 got selected and were made offers.

4) 1 of the selected declined to join few days ago as he is taking civil services exam and he has done well in prelims. (Wish him the best! He told us that he may not join if he does well in the exam)

5) And this last one is a great surprise. A young British guy contacted me and it was tough for us. He was very passionate about working in India and we gave him all the disclaimers about working in India and in Delhi. We are a self funded startup, so cant pay really great salaries. He proved his credentials, did well during the hiring process and after reference check and other formalities, he is joining us on Monday. We have people from all across India and I really hope to see lot more diversity coming to our company because of him. 

Finally, thanks to this community, the guy who came up with the idea of hiring threads! Keep doing the good work. Let not noise drown the good things we do.

If you have any stories about how you connected to someone interesting on r/india, do share.

Cheers!

&amp;nbsp; 

**This post relates to Seagate Back Up Plus software, a 5TB Back up Plus external HD and a Windows 8.1 computer.**

&amp;nbsp;

This is my second post during a rather strenuous night for me. The initial post can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3n4776/boot_device_not_found_3f0_error_code_memory_hard/) &amp; relates to a OS booting issue with either my SSD or HDD.

&amp;nbsp;

My second is (*the one for which this post has been made*) relates to backing up me files. After retrying to boot my computer several times, I was able to get the OS to boot. The computer now runs as normal with files on both the SSD &amp; HDD opening and at first glance all accounted for.

&amp;nbsp;

Sensing my luck, I'm now taking this opportunity to create a new back up of my system. I booted the Seagate Dashboard, clicked to create a new backup and everything seemed to be going smoothly. 

&amp;nbsp;

**However for 35 minutes, the completion % has stayed at 8%, my external drive is not making any noises (*suggesting it isn't running, although it appears online on my computer*)  &amp; in the Task Manager, the external drive is apparently at 0% usage.**

&amp;nbsp;

I have thus far been unable to troubleshoot the issue. The only thing I have done to the external drive since purchasing it was attempt to create a partition. I shrunk the size by 1TB only to find that I was unable to reallocate the memory (*apparently a software issue*). I'm now at 3.5TB usable instead of 4.5TB. I have been able to drag-and-drop a few test files and they seem to be storing perfectly fine. as you can imagine though, this would be extremely impractical to do for all of the files I have stored.

&amp;nbsp;

It is very important that I back up my files as I have a lot of university, internship &amp; personal files stored to my computer. I also dropped over Â£100 on this External Drive and it'd be very frustrating if for some reason it didn't work. I tried contacting Seagate about this however they are unfortunately shut for the night. I'm a bit worried that if I try to close down my computer and reboot it tomorrow, it might not work. 

&amp;nbsp;

**If any other information is required please let me know. Thanks in advance.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Found the ""Test"" option in the Seagate Dashboard. Ran it and it says the Drive passed &amp; should be functioning correctly."

The internship will relocate you to your chosen city in China and will set you up with an unpaid internship with a company for your chosen length duration. For engineering it is recommended to undergo a 2 month long period as engineering companies there were unlikely to take students for one month and this will cost me about $5500 for CRCC to set it up + additional flight &amp; living. For the $5500 I can get a government fund/hecs debt (equivalent to student loans) to cover that expense and I do have enough money saved up for the flights and cost of living. Iâve applied to a bunch of internships in Australia but no luck so far, my university also offers paid summer research projects where you help out with some university projects so this is another option (I believe these are readily available for students but not too many apply). But I am keen to travel and would prefer to get industrial experience in the break rather than research experience. 

I guess my question is have any of you had experience with CRCC and what did you think of the internship? And what are your thoughts about my situation and if I should take this? Online I have read mixed reviews about the organisation and the experience. And talking to friends who have done similar exchanges/internships they said that they really enjoyed it, so Iâm just unsure but curious about it all. Thanks!

I was always a bit lazy academically and sucked at math when I was younger so there might be some impostor syndrome going on here. I'm applying to a ton of internships but I'm beginning to feel a little bit inadequate and starting to worry about my chances.

I should have started prepping for interviews sooner but I'm working pretty close to full time and I've done well in all my programming assignments and my data structures class so I think I got complacent and overly confident in my abilities and just kept putting it off. I think I know my data structures pretty well but I'm kind of surprised at how bad I am at doing anything with them. I'm spending some time reviewing them, writing implementations from scratch, working on interview-style problems, etc. but I'm pretty alarmed at how hard some things (like reversing a singly linked list) have ended up being. 

I feel like I'm getting better, but I've struggled a bit more than I'd like with ""easy"" problems on hackerrank and leetcode. Once I end up with a solution I can understand how it works but I feel like I should be better at this. Is this an aptitude/intelligence problem or do I just need more practice? I'm pretty worried about trying to find solutions under pressure since even when I'm doing them by myself I tend to get kind of lost and have to scrap everything and start over a few times for moderately challenging problems. 

I feel like I know a moderate amount about a lot of different areas but I'm not really sure I've quite mastered anything. C++ was my first language so I'm pretty comfortable with it and I've done a handful of trivial programs in Java (which I'm working with now since I plan on using it in interviews) and Python. It's been a while since I used C++ and I haven't done as much with any other language so I'm not sure I'd know which libraries to use or things like that. I don't have any really serious side projects yet so I'm trying to get a couple off the ground but I'm not sure I'll have enough progress with anything to show by the time I interview. 

Where should I be spending my time? Data structures type questions? Side projects? Something else?  "

3n8vqs,1,2015-10-02,Best non-Bachelor option to find work while working on a bachelor's?,HumanMilkshake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3n8vqs/best_nonbachelor_option_to_find_work_while/,"Because I hate the job I have I'm eager to find a job in CS while I work on a BS (I'm currently at the best paying job I have with my current skill set, and anything else would come with a serious cut in pay). From reading here, it seems like my options would mostly be UI/UX work and freelance web development. It seems like either would pay enough for me to live on, but I'd rather have more stable income than from freelancing. 

I'm just not sure which of my options would help me get to the interview easiest, and I was hoping for some direction:

* Associates from a community college

Has some classes that are important to the bachelor's program (intro to web development, calc I and II, C++ 1 and 2), but most of the classes won't. Includes a more broad range of technologies (Java, SQL, MySQL, C++, XML), but doesn't include courses on algos or data structures. There's also an internship program, but I doubt it's paid. Could still be a good start point for an actual job, but it would kind of be the shot gun maneuver: it would have to be 40 hours a week, so I'd have to quit my job, so if it doesn't turn into a job I'd kind of be screwed, especially if it's an unpaid internship. 

* Just take the classes that transfer to the bachelor's program

This would kind of be a ""hope for the best"" type approach. The CC's internship is meant for someone in the final quarter of an associates, so I don't think they'd let me take it in this scenario. The bachelor's program has an internship which I assume is paid, but is meant for seniors, so I wouldn't qualify. I'm sure I'd be plenty qualified for free lancing, but again, I was hoping for something more stable.

* Boot camp.

There are two in my area. One for 7.5K I don't have, that describes itself as ""all day, every day"" for 12 weeks and boasts a 98% placement rate. The other is 5k and 13.5 hours of classwork a week for 11 weeks, and I'm not seeing anything about their placement rate. The more expensive option I'd have to quit my job for, and the cheaper one I could continue working, though I'd have to change my shift. A big disadvantage of these vs the CC, is that with the CC at least some of the classes will transfer to the BS program, so even if I don't find a job, the money wasn't a waste.

I'm going to call the CC and see what their placement rate is, if the internship is paid, and if the internship is available to non-terminal students. I was hoping for some direction before then though.

Edit:

**TL;DR** Want to get a job in CS while working on a bachelor's because I hate my current job. Is it best for me to go to a boot camp, get an associates at a community college, or just take the classes at the CC that transfer and hope for the best?"
3n9e53,1,2015-10-02,"I moved to a small town and miss my friends to the point that it's given me anxiety attacks. I'm afraid I'm beginning to resent my wife for this, but it's not her fault. Not sure what to do. (long)",Venthorn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3n9e53/i_moved_to_a_small_town_and_miss_my_friends_to/,"This takes a while to get to both the point and the present, but I'm trying to present all details I think are relevant. I met my wife when we were both in college. We were college sweethearts and shared the same friend group. I am a very extroverted person and need lots of social interaction, though I did not always realize this.

I count graduating college (at 22) as the worst day of my life. I went on to a graduate school four hours away while my wife had another two years left. I struggled a lot during this period. I would come back every other weekend to visit her and my large friend group that was still there. When she graduated, we got married (I was 24 then) and she moved in with me in graduate school where we remained another two years until I graduated. These two years were really bad. I had difficulty making friends in graduate school due to the difference between undergrad/grad and it primarily being an undergraduate place. I was depressed a LOT. My one shining moment during this time was when I was an intern at a tech company in New York City, where I spent three and a half months. I worked hard, played online games with friends in the evenings and every weekend was doing something with my many college friends who had relocated to NYC after graduating.

After I graduated from grad school, I got a full-time position at the tech company with offers in both California and NYC. I believed at the time there was more opportunity in California and took that offer. I consider this to be the biggest mistake of my life and I don't know what I was thinking. We both found California (silicon valley) to be miserable and while we had a couple friends there that I met in graduate school, they eventually moved away and so did we after a year and a half.

That brings me to where we are today. We had both had a big desire to be homeowners and didn't like renting in CA. We talked about our options. She was, and remains, dead-set against living in NYC. I would absolutely love to live there, a fact that surprised me (I once thought I would hate it, until I had my internship there and had an amazing experience). We decided to compromise by purchasing a house about an hour and a half from the city, very close to where we both went to college and only two hours from her family who we love very much. We've now lived there for six months.

That's where we are now. I have been an absolute mess. It's a combination of factors. I'm dreading turning 30; I'm realizing that I spent a lot of my 20s chasing useless stuff like things, status, and certificate when I should have been focusing on what really matters (friends and family). And most of all, the big gaping hole in my heart, is that I miss my friends. My wife tries for me, she really does. We go out a lot on the weekends. We've visited her family a lot (I LOVE her family). We've gone to the city once, and had friends from the city come up on a couple occasions. It's just not enough for me, though. I need more...like, almost every weekend social get-togethers. But that's too much for her (she is introverted), and she wants some quiet weekends with me. Our events are also less spontaneous and more pre-planned due to the distance, which grates on me a bit.

I've wanted to make local friends that we could hang out with more, but that's proved very difficult because this is a small town. Even though I have always loved this town and this area I'm starting to go stir-crazy. I feel like there's this gaping hole in my heart that my friends used to fill. I'm feeling trapped by the decisions that led me to this point and most of all I'm afraid that I'm starting to resent her for the compromise that landed us here instead of in NYC, and the inability to go out and be social all the time. But I love my wife. We were college sweethearts and on most axes we are compatible, just not this. Resentment kills relationships and that's the last thing I want to feel towards her.
On a more psychiatric level, I did start on Lexapro soon after moving here when I started to get this feelings and broke down crying a lot. It helps most of the time, but sometimes I get triggered (recently by a silly story that had two BFFs that remained close for their lives) and things just snowball and I break down crying and a mess. That happened this week and that's why I'm trying, now, to get advice for figuring this out and working my way through it. I love my wife, and I need her in my life. But I also love my friends, and I need them in my life too. But I can't see a path to reconcile this.

A few miscellaneous details: I've tried meetup.com to meet some new people. There's a monthly meeting of tech workers from about an hour radius from a center point, which I fall in. I've gone twice, missed this month's (it was yesterday) because we had wanted to do our yearly Halloween shopping tradition.

**HELP!**

After coming home from 3 weeks vacation in Florida, I rushed to turn on my pc, which I built back in november and it's been running smoothly ever since. After 15 mins of pure bliss it shut off and I haven't been able to turn it on since. I checked the cable, the power strip but help. If I remove the cable and leave it for a few mins I can come back and the PSU does a ""click"" when I push the power button on the case but nothing else happens.

After researching online I was 90% sure it was the PSU, and went to the place I bought it and got it replaced. Just got home, patiently plugged all the cables in (the PSU is modular, so it was easy), and same exact thing happened .. just a little click.

ASUS MAXIMUS VII HERO, Socket-1150  
HyperX Fury DDR3 1600MHz 16GB Black

Please help me get this sorted, I'm going out of my mind!

Thanks in advance

EDIT: Reseated the ram and tried pushing the ""Power"" button directly on the Motherboard, which resulted in the PSU sounding like it was short-circuited with a semi loud bang and a little flash. Shiiieeet.. I'm not feeling too good about this one.."

I didn't get a CS degree, but I did major in a concentration where we did a lot of programming. Problem is that I didn't take an internship and I am not getting too many offers in the programming jobs I apply to. Only one web development agency that offered me $30k base salary. Am I barking up the wrong tree here?

The degree I have is a Bachelor's in Arts with a concentration in Electronic Media. Here are the relevant courses I took:

* **Introduction to Computer Graphics** - Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make interactive web pages, and some interactive graphics
* **Advanced Computer Graphics** - Written simple demo programs in C with OpenGL and Linux environment
* **Virtual Reality I and II** - Wrote programs for virtual reality simulations for [CAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment) using a proprietary scripting language
* **Smart Art - Physical Computing** - Introduced microcontrollers like Arduino One to make devices that interact with the physical world. We also used C here, and Processing Language alongside it.

We were also encouraged to take some mid-level CS courses to supplement our art education. I took a 100-level class that also used HTML and JavaScript, but also PHP, and a 200-level class that taught us OOP with Java."

I haven't prepared anything for this graduate exam(which is due in 4 months) and i will again get a 2nd tier college like the one i am in through it. 

Now second option is getting a decent job i am pretty good at programming i regularly take part in programming competitions also manage to get a decent rank sometimes. I am well versed with python, C/C++, Java .... Don't know much about web technology though :P

I love solving algorithmic problems and creating software. Some of the personal projects that i have created includes a
Encryption program (that can encrypt your pictures, text files, source codes with a decent cryptography algorithm) I made 2 versions of this program one using win32 API another using Adobe AIR for the frontend and C++ for the backend this software was picked up by softpedia and they gave it a decent rating and wrote me a awesome app description, I recently designed a board game for android (which uses a AI algorithm to play against the user) recently which i published on play store 3 months ago which currently has over one thousand downloads and a decent user rating of 4/5. I developed an application to conduct online and offline quizzes during my internship in a small private startup. I have  done some other projects but i cant write them on a resume apart from one none of my projects are certified ie done under someone's supervision but all of them have some user base.

As application season starts in Europe, I am getting anxious about my admission chances in one of the best European Economic Graduate schools - Barcelona GSE( http://www.barcelonagse.eu/ )
I want to apply to either the finance or economics program.

Here is a quick summary of my biography:

This year I graduated at  ss Cyril and Methodius University - Skopje, the State university of Macedonia. 
There I studied Economics and specialized in Finance. My GPA is 9.44/10 . Mathematical subjects that I studied were Intro to math( covered linear algebra basics and calculus), Statistics, Financial Mathematics, Quantitative methods( Markov Chains, Simulation methods), Econometrics, Financial Econometrics and Time series Analysis. 
I had the best possible scores in all of them.

For the last two years I worked at the faculty as TA in both intro to Mathematics and Statistics.
Also during those years I was intern at the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts(MASA), at the Center for Computer Science and Information Technologies where I modeled Electricity markets( although there was an agent-based part, my part only involved time-series modeling).
Currently I work on a project at the same Center at MASA, where I research economic growth with the help of Graph Theory and Econometrics.


Recently I took TOEFL and got a score of 101 ( R-26, L-28, S-23, W-24). I'm taking my GRE exam on 17th October, although I don't have any good expectations about my verbal score.

Two weeks in and i'm STILL trying to get spark to build, and trying to get the scala code to compile, and the java packages aren't working with maven and every little thing has a problem that blocks me from doing anything related to CS.

What i've done the past two weeks is write down every keyword I haven't head before (Spark, Scala, Hadoop, Spotfire, Tableau, Knime, RDD, ...) and spend hours taking notes on the wikipedia pages as well as looking through their github account at code I don't understand.

I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

I am originally from Europe, Romania; My wife and I moved to Phoenix, AZ 3 years ago. We started everything basically from scratch, including jobs that we did not have much background in. I enjoy my current job but I don't see myself doing the same thing when I'm 50, so I gotta change something while I can.

I have an electrical engineering undergraduate degree (power generation/transport/distribution) but I have not worked in this field in the past decade. Nor do I have a real passion for it. The way I see it, this new start in life is an opportunity for a career change.

My passion has always been coding, even going back to highscool. The languages I used years back are not used anymore. So I recently started learning programming in C# and the .NET framework, watching online tutorials (MVA, wibit.com, learnvisualstudio.net). I totally love it. I am only at the beginning of this road but I want to get my first job as a software developer before I turn 40. I am not sure how things work in the US job market, given my age, lack of experience, training in a different field, etc so I need some advice on taking the best route to reaching my goal.

Here is my dilemma.
Should I go back into school to get my masters in ""computer science"" or ""software engineer"" (or whatever names they have in US)? Is that worth the time and money?
Should I invest into getting any Microsoft .NET certifications?
Having no real coding experience, would enrolling into some internship for a software company work?

Any ideas might help. In the meantime I will keep on learning C# and eventually get into Java. Thanks guys."

My parents are pressuring me to spend all my time applying and searching for jobs immediately because no one will hire me if I wait too long. I believe if I do this with my less than stellar resume, I will get a terrible job or waste a lot of time and energy.

Would much rather spend my time working on a project I can be proud of to put on my resume as I do not believe recruiters will care about the sudoku puzzle solving python thing or the C++ 2D shooter game I did as class projects.

Is it important to start applying immediately? or could I take a few months to work on a project, do some studying, and just up my confidence.

I have a previous degree in a liberal arts field. I was originally taking undergrad classes with the goal of doing a master's but I needed so many that I decided just to do a second bachelor's. I'm working 30-40 hours a week depending on my schedule so I haven't done any internships yet. I wish I'd done an internship sooner but I'm still applying for summer internships. Failing that, I'm hoping to get an entry level positions. 

I can't figure out what to do for a personal project. The general advice seems to be to do something to solve a problem you have in life or something related to something you're passionate about. I guess I'm just boring but I cannot think of anything. 

I feel like none of my school projects have really prepared me all that well. I've done well on all my assignments but I haven't done anything that really challenged me or taken longer than a week. I feel like, while I'm good with programming fundamentals, I don't really understand the bigger picture and how the pieces fit together when it comes to the architecture/design of larger projects. I also worry that I'm just not really a good programmer but a lot of that seems to have to do with motivation. I like programming enough that I think I'd be content to do it as a career but I'm never going to be very passionate about it.

I'm fairly confident with interview-style questions involving algorithms and data structures so I'm not worried about that. I'm more worried about actually getting interviews in the first place.

A lot of people here seem to go to target schools and have a lot of ambition. I know I'm not shit compared to all the people who are studying this at a younger age, making all kinds of cool projects and contributing to larger projects, and getting internships at places like Google. I feel pretty goddamn inadequate but that's an issue for my therapist.

The thing is, I don't really care about working at Google or an exciting startup. I don't care if I do challenging or exciting work. I just want to go from having a low-paid boring job to having a job that pays better and is a bit more engaging. I know I should probably have a bit more ambition, but at this point in my life I'm not sure if I can even afford to.

I'm fine with on relatively boring projects at boring companies. I don't care about working at a tech giant that big, important things. I don't care if I work in a dog-friendly office that has craft beer on tap. What kind of jobs/companies should I be looking at? I'm fine with not living in Seattle or San Francisco. I'm fine with making a relatively low salary for the industry. I know I'm probably going to end up with a boring company full of mediocre developers but, and I don't mean to sound self-pitying, that's probably where I belong.

Any particular companies/industries I should be looking at? Any particular cities? Is there much different about the interview/hiring process for companies that aren't as desirable? Anything else I should know?"

The Black Dog, Finale

I walked outside and didnât get eaten. The street was dark, except for a flickering sign that marked the entrance to the old motel. No sign of any dogs--black or otherwise. I looked back at Jim and gave him the thumbs up. He gave me a quick nod and slammed the door shut.
     
The paranoid 20ft walk to my car felt like an eternity. The hand holding my snubnosed .38 was slick with sweat by the time I slipped it back into my jacket. I got in the car and locked the door.
     
Now what?
     
It was getting late and chances were good that Bill had already left the office for the day. I needed information on that client. I knew Bill kept records of everyone we worked with--in our line of work you kind of had to for legal reasons--but I had a feeling Bill wouldnât believe my story. I could hardly believe it myself.
     
I turned the key and started the engine. I remember arguing with myself about leaving Jim to die and forgetting about the whole mess. In hindsight Iâm glad I wasnât that much of a coward.
     
The office was dark by the time I got there, but I knew where we kept the key. I lifted the brick and grabbed it, walking towards the door only to find that it wasnât locked. It would have been easy to pass that off as an oversight by Bill or one of the other agents heading out for the night, but then I wouldnât have been very good at my job if Iâd thought that way. I drew my .38 again and headed inside, leaving the lights off as I ascended the staircase leading to Billâs office. Thatâs where Iâd find the clients info, if he hadnât gotten to it already.
     
I listened intently as I made it to the office door. No light shown inside, but a rustling noise came from the room. I put one hand on the door and held my .38 out in front of me with the other. In one swift motion I threw open the door and flipped the lightswitch with my elbow.
     
Bill tossed the donut heâd been munching in front of the window and held his arms high in the air as if in surrender.
     
âHoly shit.â I breathed, âItâs just you.â
     
Billâs eyes bugged out as he realized who I was.
     
âWho the fuck else would it be? What the fuck are you doing sneaking around the office with your piece out in your hand like itâs your fucking taliwhacker!â
     
My cheeks reddened as I stowed my .38.
     
âYouâll never believe the day Iâve had. Why were you in here in the dark eating a donut anyway?â
     
Bill shrugged. âItâs kind of peaceful in here at the end of the day. Whatâs up?â
     
I rubbed my hands across my face, âI need information on the client Iâve been working for.â.
     
âYou know it doesnât work like that. What happened? Find some scumbag with a sob story?â
     
âBill, I think heâs using the info I give him and killing these people.â
     
He stiffened up at that, âWhat gives you that idea, Ellis?â.
     
âWell for starters the first two people I located are currently dead as fuck and the third one barely escaped with his life within the past few hours.â
     
Bill shook his head in disappointment, âSo youâve seen it then.â.
     
My heart lurched, âYou know about the Black Dog?â.
     
He chuckled, âSon of a bitch, Ellis. You were supposed to be the patsy.â
     
âWhat the fuck are you talking about?â
     
âToo dumb to notice you were being framed. I got that part right, but damnit if you didnât fuck it all up anyway. Iâm not sure if you're lucky or just an expert at being a pain in the ass.â
     
Bill took a step back towards the window. Something growled behind me.
     
He smiled, âGuess Iâm about to find out.â.
     
Something hot clamped down on my right calf. My entire right side felt like it was on fire, the things teeth were melting the meat of my leg like butter. I crashed to the ground as the Black Dog jerked its head to the side, taking a hunk of my leg with it.
     
I was absolutely fucked and I knew it, but I wasnât about to let that smug son of a bitch watch me die with a smile on his fat face. I squirmed around on the bloody floor and managed to grab my .38.
     
The first shot blew a hole in Bills designer shoe and sent him reeling backwards towards the window. I squeezed the trigger again, feeling the hot breath of the Black Dog on the back of my neck.
     
The second shot thudded into Billâs chest and sent his fat ass out the open window.
     
His body hit with a wet smack on the pavement below and I braced myself for the end. Only the end never came. I squirmed across the bloodied floor and looked back. Nothing. The Black Dog was gone.
     
I pulled myself up onto Billâs desk chair and dialed the boys in blue.
     
Over the next few days the detectives found out that good ole Bill had been making people disappear for quite some time. Theyâd combed through our records and found a lot of matches to our cases tied in with missing persons and cold cases stretching back years. Quite a few of which had been labeled animal maulings.
     
The story Jim and I stuck with is that heâd helped me discover what Bill had been up to and Iâd came to the office that night looking to confront him and get to the truth. Luckily Bill had been pretty clumsy about framing me for the murders--just a shitty paper trail linking me to the victims--and the detectives saw right through it with a bit of scrutiny.
     
They asked me what happened to the Dog. I just said it freaked out and took off after Bill went out the window and I was more worried about trying not to bleed to death. Iâm not sure if they really believed me, but they couldnât seem to think of how Iâd lie about it either so they let it go.
     
It took a few weeks of physical therapy to get me walking again with that chunk of leg missing and I still use a cane to this day. I ended up working with the police a bit more and completing my internship requirement for my Investigator's license. Wasnât long before I had my own firm.
     
It would be a few years before I found out more about what bumps in the night, but it all started there and then. That case led me down a rabbit hole I'll never be able to crawl back out of. I began devouring any information on the Occult or local folklore that I could get my hands on. That's when I realized, you see a lot more of the world when you know what to look for. 

The Black Dog Murders as Iâd come to call them, were only the tip of the iceberg. 

Note:
I hope you all have enjoyed the retelling of my first truly fucked up case. There are plenty more waiting to be told. Maybe I'll tell you all about the first time I was cursed? That was one hell of a weekend. "

Last night I was searching for personal project ideas since I'm a lazy fuck.

Would this be a good initial personal project, or would I have to work harder than that to catch an employer's eye for internships?

The ratio of full time employees to ""interns"" can range up to 30% interns of the whole company. During this trial period, they directly manage client accounts worth up to $150,000 a year and are paid $10 an hour for 40 hours a week.  They are encouraged to work unpaid overtime as it will ""prove that they are willing to put in the extra work"" to work at the company.  In addition to this, they:

1) Not only are not paid ""time and a half"" after 8 hours of work, but are not paid at all past 40 hours.

2) Are required to use personal vehicles for company tasks without compensation.

3) Agree to a 3 month trial period but will remain ""interns"" at the same pay and no benefits if they don't press the issue.

4) Permanent employees who are overworked and quit (2 weeks notice) are denied their accrued PTO pay and are told they can't use the company on their resumes.

5) A foreign employee has been kept on ""intern"" status without pay increase or benefits for a year saying they can't sponsor her Visa???

6) The official employee handbook states that you will not be paid overtime until you work 12 hours in a day (contrary to CA law, I believe)

7) I also believe that many people are mis-classified as contract workers or overtime exempt.

Perhaps not a legal grievance but clients are unaware that their accounts are handled by unqualified and inexperienced interns and are being charged at high hourly rates.  Once hired, the starting pay rate for everyone is 32k a year with 5 days of PTO until you reach 3 years.  This includes very technical fields such as programmers and website designers.

A few people have been keeping detailed tracking of their hours and would like to do something about the situation.  Does anyone have any insight into the pros and cons of reporting this to a labor board or if it would be even worth taking further legal action?  The grievances are not only for interns but there are more for permanent employees as well.  

I've never posted here before but I appreciate any advice anyone can give! Thanks!"

I'm senior in CS and have applied to a lot of places for internships (which I do every year) and have never been able to get anything. My gpa is around a 2.8 and I feel like I am competing with people who all have had extensive projects they did through ACM or work, which I never did. I am getting really worried that I will have worked on this degree for nothing or that I will end up in a low paying job I hate. I feel like people in my situation only find jobs if they have done a lot of CS extra curriculars which I never thought would be necessary.
A lot of the jobs through the jobs portal want HMTL/CSS/Javascript/PHP/SQL experience or other related things which I never really did in school.
I've been to career fairs but I am always asked my GPA and it all goes downhill from there. I'm getting very depressed about this and could really use some advice or just comments from people who have had a similar situation."

But in reality, I know guys that tell me they could never date me for these specific reasons.  One guy I attend law school with has said to me, âgirls in law school are either fat or opinionated.â
Frankly, I respect men who know what they want and are honest with me from the get go.  I am not angered when a man says that he wants to be ""the breadwinner,"" or that he pictures his future wife only as a ""housewife.""  Although, Iâve become more and more surprised that men, with goals and an education, do not want a woman who has the same.

A little bit of background on me:  I am [23F] in my second year at law school.  Growing up, I devoted myself to music and tennis.  At university, I played tennis on the school team, traveled the world, and modeled for a well-known clothing company.  Like many girls, I loved hanging out with friends and had a few serious relationships in high school and college.  Unlike many girls that I know, I decided to continue my education in a difficult field.  I am very carefree and open-minded about my life.  I know life is like a poker game, and you never know what you could be doing down the road.  Iâd love to continue traveling the world, and would love to intern abroad this next summer. But back to my questionâ¦

Even though I live in a major city, I have not been involved with any men since I came to law school.  Men, who I would typically go for, are either in a relationship, or just want to hook up.  I havenât been asked out on one date nor had a hook up in over a year.  Iâve met men who look past the fact that Iâm in law school, but I come to realize they are actually just trying to cheat or hook up that evening.  
I just find it so weird that men seem so turned off just because I decided to continue furthering my education.  I'm still the same person as I was when I was at university, but I've just gained more wisdom.  Maybe Iâve just had a lot of bad luck, but I do know guys are not necessarily âturned onâ to the idea of dating a future attorney.

3ngjs1,7,2015-10-04,Phone Anxiety,Potato_With_Eyes,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/3ngjs1/phone_anxiety/,"Hello, this is my first Reddit text post but thereâs something bothering me about applying for jobs/internship, and I was hoping I could get some advice.

Iâm a 21 year old CS student in France, and Iâm hoping to get an internship for the next summer. I also have a class this semester in which we talk about our future careers, how to write a letter and CV, etc. While writing the first draft of a letter, I was painfully reminded today that I am crippled by anxiety when it comes to phone calls.

I absolutely never pick up calls from anyone but my parents or my sister, (except maybe from a close friend if I have to), and I never call anyone. In fact, I have to force myself to Skype with my parents at least once week for a checkup. I donât order food via telephone, I donât make my own appointments at the doctor, dentist, etc. I think the last time I made a phone call to a non-relative was a few years ago when I had to call my driverâs ed instructor to set the date for my first driving lesson, and that 2 minute interaction made me want to throw up.

Earlier this year, I sent an application to a company via their website, and the next few weeks I felt absolutely restless from 8 AM to 5 PM every weekday because I expected a call any second, although they ended up answering via email. I am shaking and crying right now just *thinking* of sending in the next application and possibly getting a phone call.

Obviously, this also means that I am not a phone person at all. Although I take my phone with me at all times, itâs mostly sitting in my bag in mute mode. Itâs not rare that friends and family get upset when I reply hours later because I forgot to check it, whereas I see my emails immediately.  
  
So how do I tackle this? Iâm nowhere near as nervous about face-to-face interviews as I am about the phone call, even if itâs just to *set a date* for the interview. Am I allowed to leave out the phone number? Or to mention that I prefer emails? Or is all of that a no-go, and I should accept that there's no way around these panic attacks?"

In doing so am I hurting my chances with other companies in the future?  I've been interviewing very well at these places, so I think it'd be best to continue.

My dad recently got into an accident and cannot walk and on top of that he gets seizures on a monthly basis. What's worse is that my grandma fractured her ankle just yesterday and is undergoing surgery right now. Prior to this shit storm my dad &amp; mom owned multiple businesses. They had some success for while but then things turned around. We have sold our business and have exhausted all the profits we made paying of an audit. My dad is jobless due to this accident and I don't think he'll ever work again due to his medical condition (he 56 years old).

Now I'm a 22 year old student attending university. I just got an internship at Husky injection which will pay me about 40k. My mom makes about $14/hr. I have two sisters who are in school and probably make $100/weekly combined. I've been trying to tell my sisters the severity of our situation but they don't seem to give a shit, which pisses the heck out of me. We are also on welfare and have many outstanding bills. I believe we also have 30k line of credit in debt.

Now below are all the expensive I believe we have.
House hold of Six: (Me, mom, dad, 2x sisters, grandma)

Car lease: $280/month 

Transportation: $550/month 

Mortgage: $2200/month 

Food: $500/month 

Nursing home: $1250/month (for my grandpa who doesn't get along with my family) 
Phone/internet: $400/month 

Insurance: $500/month 

Utilities: $450/month

I really want to help my mom out so I've been trying to pay off bills and credit debt from my internship. Note we have no savings or a steady source of income besides my temporary internship. This is b/c my mom visits my dad and grandma who are both in the hospital right now. However once they get better she'll probably get a second job and work regular hours.
Now I was hoping if you guys could help me out. How on earth does a family like mine get out of all this debt? How can I get my family financially stable so I can get my life on track. Are there resources that I can use for assistance? Do you have some money saving tips? What can my dad do at home to make money (he can't drive b/c he has seizures) ?

Do you have a similar story? How did you get your life back on track?

Any advice would be grateful. I never would have imaged my family going through this struggle but here we are. I just hope that I can fix this soon so I can get on with my life."

Thread",ch3rrygarcia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3nhthr/yet_another_is_cs_right_for_me_thread/,"I'm halfway through my first semester at a state university, and I've recently been reconsidering Computer Science as a major. I'm a declared Political Science major who wants to do law school after, but have only taken one course in it, so not too hard to get out. I've also brought in 48 credit hours before starting this fall semester, so I could do it in 3-4 years I believe. 

I took computer programming classes in high school (one on C++, one on Java) and loved the idea of it, but was very turned off to the whole thing by a bad instructor - I've retained little to no knowledge from those classes as a result. I have several concerns about switching majors though.

1. My current opinion of math is that it's frightening and I don't like it. I never took precalc in high school (got away with just doing trig/analytical geo), let alone calculus. When I saw differential equations in a friends notebook, one glance made me never want to take the class. Does programming in the long run involve super high-level math? If so, is it possible for someone like me to pick it up without much prior experience? 

2. I've heard that CS is rigorous and disallows much off-time. My university has a 60-something credit hour course track for the BS in CS, as opposed to my current 30-hour track for Poli. Sci. In taking CS classes, will I be studying 24/7? Poli. Sci. comes very easy to me (as it does most) and I'm confident I could maintain a very high GPA. Does GPA matter for CS after graduation? Does it matter for anything as long as you do graduate?

3. Seems as if the job field for CS is high risk. The idea of a stable job is very appealing to me, which is why I wanted to go to law school. I've heard that in getting a CS job, your experience (as in internships etc.) is more important than your grades or what school you've gone to. My school, Florida State, is ranked only 80-something in the nation in CS, and is in a semi-rural, definitely not CS-booming area. Will I be SOL when it comes to internships? If I'm not brimming with ideas for start-ups, am I also SOL?

4. I feel I'm inescapably behind. I have friends from high school who are fluent in several programming languages, have internships already, and a group that has already started a company. I have the feeling that CS is a field that, if you're not brilliant and prodigious, you're at a major disadvantage - anyone who has every made it big seems to have done it since they were kids. If I'm just starting to learn CS in college, am I behind the crowd?
 
5. If it turns out I don't enjoy it as much as I think I would, I am sure my GPA will be garbage after this revelation. How do I know it's right for me?

I appreciate and thank anyone who can help me figure this stuff out in advance."

Advice on fixing it as a 30 year old?,trabandasil,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3niaw4/i_broke_my_resume_advice_on_fixing_it_as_a_30/,"Long story short, I screwed myself over by moving to another country where I couldn't legally work for two years. I have a college degree in... ahem... Psychology, which is why I'm trying to figure out a new field entirely - one that would be realistic to pick up at the age of 30.

Before I moved to the new country, I worked as a marketing coordinator for about 4 years for a pretty big company. I single-handedly managed the ""department,"" which included doing everything from website maintenance to designing all of the ads, adwords and SEO, organizing data for quarterly reports, setting up media interviews and tours and so on. I had a pretty sweet deal there, and enjoyed doing it because it was for a cause I believed in (but do not wish to continue working with). That job, and I'm assuming all of the credit for the experience I acquired there, is long gone 3 years later. I moved to a new country to work for my boyfriend-now-husband's company, doing, basically, not as much as I was promised. He started getting work with other companies, while I was still stuck in this work permit with his company that was just sitting there... So I had fewer and fewer responsibilities, and no ability to seek work elsewhere, but I of course still wanted to remain in the country because of our relationship. After some time, I fell off the 'career' train that I was on and lost a lot of confidence in myself. 

In my down time (and there is a lot of it), I either volunteer at an animal shelter, play in a few music projects, work an under the table cafe job, tend house or try to stave off the depression paired with crippling anxiety that I've developed. Fun stuff. I think my brain just cannot handle the idleness of it, not to mention the disrespect that comes with being a ""non-person house wife."" I know that it's way too risky for my own future, and to be honest, it makes me feel like a loser. 

My permanent residency is on it's way, which means I'll finally be able to work again. This would have been a blessing a few years back, but now it's just causing a lot of panic, as I'm finally having to own up to the past few years of zero progress. So I turn to school... but for what?

A little bit about me... I consistently pick something up, gain an amateur amount of knowledge, and move on to the next thing. I am capable and smart, when I have a goal. I'm having a hard time settling on a field that is both interesting and realistic. For instance, if I could do it all over again, right now, I would study VR development. It definitely has a future and is beyond interesting. I was playing around with Unity and an oculus the other day and making some way with it. I felt like it clicked, and this is what I could pursue, I guess, under the umbrella of 'game development'... but is it realistic to do this from scratch at such an old age (30), with no CS degree, and this big gap in my resume? Maybe not. I have the same thought about pretty much everything else my unrealistic self would want to pursue... sound design, audio engineering, film editing... I am too old and amateur to even think about getting into such saturated fields. And with this new gap in my resume, I feel like I wouldn't stand a chance to the 20 year olds with 4 year degrees, internships and experience in any of the above.

A little bit more about me... this 'trench' that I've been in for the past few years has completely thrashed my social skills. I have a panic disorder that's gotten out of control. I'm terrified of going to class, or really, pursuing anything that would require me speaking to a group of people, which is why I find schooling/working remotely so appealing. I know that getting some experience under my belt and a direction in life is the key to overcoming it. But starting slow in my own space is the ideal, so that I can rebuild the confidence I once had without first crashing and burning into a fiery blaze of panic attacks in front of a classroom of 20 year olds.

This post is a novel by now, so thank you to anybody still listening and thank you in advance for any advice you have to spare. I appreciate it.

tl;dr Shooting for something that I can work remotely that is not too silly to dive into at the age of 30... Also any and all advice on patching up a 3 year gap in the resume, or at least something substantial that might distract an employer from it would be much appreciated."

3nin59,1,2015-10-04,"I'm over 30, have over 5 years of dev experience and also cannot find financial independence and am staying with my mom. I feel like the programming industry has done me dirty. What to do?",thecareertech,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3nin59/im_over_30_have_over_5_years_of_dev_experience/,"Here's the short run of my background: 

I'm a web developer with over 5 years of experience, and have a tendency to get hired by startups that are financially rocky/unstable. I apply to and interview for larger, more stable companies, but none have given me any offers. 

Even the first company I worked for (in my web dev career) ran into problems issuing paychecks to their employees on time. My salary history is well below average for a developer for the city I live in. 

I started working as a web developer for two downtown jobs in Chicago, from '07 to '10. The first one I started in my senior year, paid $12 an hour, and being the only developer there, I'm put on call. Second job was also downtown, paid its programmers $15 an hour and I started on a three-month contract. 

There were false promises of taking their workers off the 1099 and giving them a benefits package. They have loads of negative reviews on Glassdoor with these complaints as a common thing. I was able to get by living on my own for a while, but just barely.

But then they decided they don't need some local developers, it wasn't profitable for them, so I was laid off. There was no severance pay because I was on a 1099, and nobody in the Chicago dept. of employment services was able to locate the office (employees were paid through PayPal).

So while living on my little nest egg I built up I was trying to find a job. 10 months after a long search the nest egg ran out and had to move back with my mom.

My most recent job I was working on a complex web app for another startup, they paid $20 an hour. Then a year later, we were supposed to discuss my performance and I was very hopeful because there's a good chance I was going to get a raise because I was in very good standing with him. 

Then my boss broke out some bad news.

The company is losing sales, they fired a few sales people and have to cut down hours for everyone else. My initial thought was *Not again!!* These startups sure suck. I was reduced from 40 hours a week to 16 hours, and then six months after that, I was laid off. I still get work from time to time but they are based on tasks and hours are not fixed.

I do apply for places that offer more/have been around for a long time, but I can't seem to get those jobs. The last job I worked at took me about a year of job hunting to get, only to be laid off a year and a half later. In that situation, sales of their main product plummeted in the second year. 

I have never maintained financial stability for over a year as a programmer. 

So now I'm 32 living at home with mom, I wonder why am I in this situation if I have the title of software engineer in my jobs? I may not have a CS degree, but I do know many common algorithms and design patterns, and have applied a lot of OOP in my jobs. I have done side projects like a graphics engine and even did homebrew with PSP as far back as 2006 which used C++. Despite that why am I only being hired by such small companies that pay peanuts?

Edit: As I don't have a CS degree, I also don't have any internships, and the only people I know that work as programmers are my co-workers or past co-workers. My friends have tried but haven't been able to find a job that fits me well."

It just always seemed like such a cool place to work and I made it my goal to work there someday. Well, it's three years into college, and I finally got an offer for an internship at Google. 

But, now that I have the offer, I'm thinking about declining it. The issue is, Google doesn't really tell you what kind of work you'll be doing as an intern, and it seems fairly likely it might not be something I'm the most passionate about. Meanwhile I have another offer from a smaller, much lesser known company, doing work that I'm almost certain I will love and that actually makes me look forward to the summer.

But I just don't know if I can bring myself to turn down an offer from Google. First, I keep thinking back to myself a few years ago and how horrified I would have been at myself by the thought of turning down Google. Then I have all my family/friends, who tell me that I should just take the internship at Google and work there for a few years (if they hire me full-time) to get their name on my resume and then go back to the company that I was really interested in if I still want to.

I realize this may come off as if I have already made my decision to turn down Google and am only looking for validation, but that's not true at all. In fact I'm actually leaning towards taking Google's offer right now. I think it really comes down to I'm torn between just how awesome the idea of working at Google is, vs. how awesome the actual work I'd be doing at this other company is. I'd really appreciate any advice.

Edit: Forget to add there's also the issue of pay. I know this isn't a huge consideration for an intern, but Google pays almost twice as much as this other company, in addition to all the perks."

I graduated a few years ago with a Finance and Econ degree and was working in Finance for the past couple years. Last year I applied to and was accepted to a MS in CS program at a school with a growing CS department but a very good overall reputation. Classes started this fall and I will most likely end up graduating next December or early 2017.

Now as part of this program we are required to do an internship (or research) next summer. Now I have a decent understanding of Python and have been learning java for a bit and studying algorithms on my own for a couple months but that is the extent of my CS knowledge right now. Currently I am in a databases class, Data Structures and Algorithms class and Java programming class.

Now my question is what can I do to help improve my chances of getting a good internship for next summer? I assume I should start applying during the end of this year/beginning of next year (once my first quarter grades come out and I have learned more about algorithms and databases) so I have around 3 months to prepare.

Also, do you think I will be at a major disadvantage compared to undergrads applying for the same internships? How much do companies expect people to know when applying for internships? Companies are currently coming to my school to do on campus recruiting for full time(including some of the Big 4). Is it worth it to stop by their tech talks or information sessions and try to get my name known? I know the answer is yes but I just have no idea what I could talk to them about when I know so little and am just starting my CS education.

Honestly, I know I made the right decision and am really excited to finally pursue a career in something I am passionate about but I am feeling a little overwhelmed by the amount of catch up I have to do. Any help would be appreciated!"

I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, if please let me know what subreddit I should be in.

I just moved to the Stuttgart area in Germany from Mexico a month ago for an internship. This last Wensday, the landlords said they were changing the locks. That morning I had to leave for a business trip, so I obviously could not be there when they changed the locks and I told them that (they gave just 24 hrs notice). I went on my busness trip, and when I came back on Friday there was no way for me to get in. They did not leave me a key or anything. So, after waiting for seven hours and having nowhere to go, I wandered around my town all night to stay warm...

I contacted them asking them to bring me a key so I can get into the apartment, but they seriously did not care. I spoke to them all day trying to get a key, but they did not try to help me at all. I emailed, called, texted, facebook messaged, everything I could think of. Anything they answered was very unhelpful. I could tell they had no intention of helping me.

I have pretty severe asthma. It gets worse and worse when it is cold outside, I am stressed out, or I exercise too much than I'm used to. So the night I was walking around, I used up the rest of my inhaler in that night. I needed to get inside to get my refill, but they would not give me a key.

I did what I thought I had to, and had a dad on the floor below me break the lock open so I could get my medicine. I would have hired a locksmith, but my phone had died by then and I had only 15 euros to my name. So the door and lock are pretty damaged, and I feel horrible about it since it also affects my roommates who moved in late the next day so they already have a bad impression about me.

What can I do in this situation? I hate this apartment. They have treated me horribly since the first day. I pay a lot of money for the apartment, how could they lock me out? Am I responsible for paying for the door? Or are they?
Is there any way I can get out of  the lease without losing my deposit (message me for the lease please)? I'm incredibly stressed out and I really don't know how to handle this, I'm in such a foreign place and I don't know how they handle things here.

Please help me, I am desperately in need. Any kind of advice, legal or not, would help me a lot.

I'm currently interning at state university as an application developer (mostly web, but some iOS development, some database design, basically mixes of everything faculty wants). I really do like mobile development, and have an Associate Degree for it, and I'm trying to enjoy the web development.


The thing is, the work around midwest seems hard to come by, especially the entry level job to get my foot into. Today, I've found a Sys Admin position that opened up, which requires 1 year of experience in ANY IT field, which I guess I am qualified for. The pay seems reasonable for entry level, and benefits are awesome.


I currently do love working at my internship position, but I don't see a position opening up soon. I really need stability in my life, and some benefits so that I don't have to pay out of my pocket everytime I get really bad flu or emergencies.


However, I'm scared that once I step into field other than programming, which I enjoy, it would be hard to come back to programmer type job. But then, I'm still an intern with not much job experience, so I could really use advice from experienced IT professionals.

3nls77,4,2015-10-05,[For Hire] Current CS Student Seeking First Internship in the Field,atlantiku,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/3nls77/for_hire_current_cs_student_seeking_first/,"Hello reddit,

My name is Jason.  I am a college graduate currently enrolled in Oregon State University's online post-baccalaureate Computer Science program.  Previously I attended the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Political Science: International Relations and minoring in Mathematics.  While at UCSD, I considered work in an NGO and later as a high school math teacher, but after a year of classroom experience in local public schools, I decided that I would prefer to pursue a different path.

Once I graduated, I went into business as a private mathematics tutor, serving high school and college students locally.  This gave me a greater understanding of the business world and helped me harness some professional skills, such as leadership, patience, and formal speaking ability.

Now I have decided to pursue my dream career: one with computers and technology.  Although I am just now beginning my official studies of computer science, I have a fair amount of personal experience with programming and some with server administration.  While in high school, I learned Java through the school's computer science course.  I continued my study of Java through a course at UCSD and later did the majority of coursework for the Data Structures class taught by Jonathan Shewchuk at UC Berkeley, thanks to the course materials being [publicly accessible](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/).  This course really helped me knuckle down with OOP and gave me a greater confidence to continue learning on my own, with or without school.

Since my days in high school, I have tinkered with various Linux distributions.  I am most fluent in Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linuxes, and my two favorite distributions are CentOS and Linux Mint.  I have set up web and ftp servers on Arch Linux and CentOS.

While working as a private tutor, I also learned Apple's new language, Swift, and to test my knowledge, I programmed a Portuguese verb conjugator in both Java and Swift.  I still have not learned how to effectively create GUIs, so the conjugator is console-based, but I am working on releasing Android and iOS apps in the near future.  This project has been mammoth in distinguishing between the various dialects and orthographic agreements that dictate the proper way to conjugate verbs as well as actually implementing an algorithm to conjugate all possible valid verb infinitive forms.

Currently I am in my second term at Oregon State, and will be graduating in Spring 2017.  I am seeking an internship or position in the field either here in San Diego or else that I can do remotely.  Unfortunately, I am stationed in San Diego for the time being as my partner will be starting her teaching credential program at a local university in May.  Although I have not yet worked in the field, I am excited to dive in and get a bit of practical experience.  I may not be familiar with the exact language or framework you use in your company, but I am a fast learner and will put in the extra time to get up to speed.

You may find my resumÃ© [here](https://aquelajane.la/) and my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/jrgoldfinemiddleton/).  If you are interested in getting in touch with me, I would appreciate it if you contact me initially through the reddit messaging system so I can be aware of how you know of me.

Thank you so much for your consideration.

He pointed out that even though I may not be able to get into the more prestigious schools with my lack of advanced programming, a masters in computer science would still bring in the job offers.  When I told him my GRE scores (163 VR / 168 QR), he assured me that getting into a program would be no issue.  I also have the support of my mother, who is in computer science, but she recommends that I pursue a graduate program that combines both computer science and statistics ('big data is very promising' according to her).

I also obtained a job last summer working as a testing intern for a startup software company that works with data management, which is the extent of my tech-y experience.

I'd like to hear your guys' opinions on both the points that have been made and the difficulties that my family and friends may have forgotten to mention.

I am a little more than halfway through my college's IT program, and had a few questions.  

*Do most undergraduate IT programs have concentrations?  For instance, a business school grad will have a concentration in finance, accg, etc.  I am having a hard time deciding what career path to choose because it seems that I am only scratching the surface, even in my higher level classes.

*How important are certifications and GPA when looking for jobs or internships? I am not a smart man and got horrible grades for the first 3 years that I was in school, but I also want to become more knowledgeable/desirable to employers.  

*What certifications would be most ideal for an intern or new grad seeking employment to have?  What are some good resources or other subreddits for a college student like me, or anyone else thinking about pursuing a degree in IT?

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks yall. "

My name is Jason.  I am a college graduate currently enrolled in Oregon State University's online post-baccalaureate Computer Science program.  Previously I attended the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Political Science: International Relations and minoring in Mathematics.  While at UCSD, I considered work in an NGO and later as a high school math teacher, but after a year of classroom experience in local public schools, I decided that I would prefer to pursue a different path.

Once I graduated, I went into business as a private mathematics tutor, serving high school and college students locally.  This gave me a greater understanding of the business world and helped me harness some professional skills, such as leadership, patience, and formal speaking ability.

Now I have decided to pursue my dream career: one with computers and technology.  Although I am just now beginning my official studies of computer science, I have a fair amount of personal experience with programming and some with server administration.  While in high school, I learned Java through the school's computer science course.  I continued my study of Java through a course at UCSD and later did the majority of coursework for the Data Structures class taught by Jonathan Shewchuk at UC Berkeley, thanks to the course materials being [publicly accessible](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/).  This course really helped me knuckle down with OOP and gave me a greater confidence to continue learning on my own, with or without school.

Since my days in high school, I have tinkered with various Linux distributions.  I am most fluent in Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linuxes, and my two favorite distributions are CentOS and Linux Mint.  I have set up web and ftp servers on Arch Linux and CentOS.

While working as a private tutor, I also learned Apple's new language, Swift, and to test my knowledge, I programmed a Portuguese verb conjugator in both Java and Swift.  I still have not learned how to effectively create GUIs, so the conjugator is console-based, but I am working on releasing Android and iOS apps in the near future.  This project has been mammoth in distinguishing between the various dialects and orthographic agreements that dictate the proper way to conjugate verbs as well as actually implementing an algorithm to conjugate all possible valid verb infinitive forms.

Currently I am in my second term at Oregon State, and will be graduating in Spring 2017.  I am seeking an internship or position in the field either here in San Diego or else that I can do remotely.  Unfortunately, I am stationed in San Diego for the time being as my partner will be starting her teaching credential program at a local university in May.  Although I have not yet worked in the field, I am excited to dive in and get a bit of practical experience.  I may not be familiar with the exact language or framework you use in your company, but I am a fast learner and will put in the extra time to get up to speed.

You may find my resumÃ© [here](https://aquelajane.la/) and my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/jrgoldfinemiddleton/).  If you are interested in getting in touch with me, I would appreciate it if you contact me initially through the reddit messaging system so I can be aware of how you know of me.

Thank you so much for your consideration.

I was wondering if anybody has any advice or has had any luck with getting a job across the country, or just really far away from you? I live on the east coast and I've wanted to move to California pretty much my entire life (specifically Los Angeles because I majored in video production). However, I can't get anybody to take my resume seriously from all the way across the country, especially because I just graduated from college so I don't have any REAL work experience (I've had retail jobs and one internship in my field). I've had a few people tell me they would be happy to interview with me once I get here, and I have had one Skype interview out of the probably hundreds of emails I've sent. 
I started to expand my search to not just LA but other western states as well because I know that ""everybody"" wants to move to LA so employers probably don't take you as seriously there. I'm now trying Austin, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, San Diego, Santa Barbara and San Fransisco.

Has anybody else successfully done this? Any tips? Also I'm not going to put down a random address because if they do call me in for an interview I'm basically screwed.

My intended semester to graduate was Spring 2017, but I realized I can graduate in Fall 2016 if I take summer class in Summer 2016, however there are a few trade offs:

1. I don't have any internship experience, so if I take that summer class in summer 2016 I won't have any internship experience by the time I apply for full time positions.
2. I would be only taking the minimum number of upper division classes, namely: Algorithms, AI, Networking, Security, and OS. I won't have enough time to take classes I'm interested in such as Human-computer Interaction and Software Engineering.
3. I'm an international student, and I read that the timeline for spring recruitment is a bit odd. I will have to get an offer by late February in order to stay in the States.

I won't be incurring any debt if I stay for an extra semester. However, there is a potential opportunity cost. My goal is to work in Seattle eventually, but I'm fine with working in the Bay Area too. What would you do if you are in my position? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!


TL;DR: Not sure whether to graduate a semester early without an internship."

I had no internships in college, but I had gone through all the big onsite interviews that were willing to overlook that (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc) but got rejected from them and hadn't even heard back from a lot of places (some later offered me interviews but by then I had started my job). So I took the first reasonable offer that was an actual coding job.

I've been here since the start of June and the job isn't terrible and the pay isn't bad, but it's not even close to what I wanted to get into, it's a big CRUD app in .NET, and I don't really enjoy writing slightly different interfaces to the same giant database all day and then spending three times as long testing everything else that might possibly be related. In school I enjoyed the little lower level stuff, with memory management and parallelism, but I didn't have the EE/CE side to get to where those types of jobs seem to be (embedded systems?). To be honest I'm not really sure what I want to do but I know this isn't it, though I don't mind it for the time being. 

I really don't want to start being seen as in this field. I don't want to do web dev, I don't want to do business applications.  My main question is below, but additionally, is it ok to switch fields a few times to figure out what I actually enjoy? everyone around me already seems to know what they want to do and doesn't seem to mind being specialized into one little thing.

tldr/my question: **How long should I stick around just for having that job experience on my resume, and how quickly should I leave before it starts becoming harder to switch to an entirely unrelated (within coding) field?** "

A little back story first: I'm a third year Computer Science student, and have spent a lot of time in Java, C, and Python. I have decent amount of experience writing and debugging code. The thing is most of my work has been for assignments, which has been great, but I feel like I'm lacking real world experience. My goal is to get a coop or internship to gain some real world experience, but I have had a hard time landing a position due to my lack of experience. I want to change this by taking some initiative and working on some personal projects for both experience and perhaps to show potential employers. 

My question for you is, where is a good place to start? I have experience coding, but all of it has been terminal based. I have never worked on an app, or a piece of software with a GUI. I want to take some steps to develop these kinds of software. I have toyed with the idea of trying to make a very elementary text editor to get started, but the problem is I know next to nothing about creating larger pieces of software. I am used to working with only 1 or 2 source files, but I want to change that.

If you have any suggestions for projects to try or useful resources I would be very appreciative. What's a good project for someone with next to no GUI experience? How can I get into developing more complex pieces of software? What is a good place to start for someone who already has a relatively sound background in programming?

No job and no real passions.,JermesHerden,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3noss4/graduating_in_a_few_months_no_job_and_no_real/,"Here's my backstory. I will be graduating with a BA in Computer Technology in a few months. I've worked at my school at the I.T help desk for 5 months and as a Web Manager assistant for 2 years. I also took a paid summer internship for this company doing help desk again.

Problem is none of these things are things I'm even the bit passionate about. I hated doing those help desk jobs. I hated taking phone calls all day about people not knowing how to use a computer. I hated having supervisors that constantly micromanaged me. I hated the uncertainty of every call and thinking ""I hope I know the answer because I'll be put in an awkward position if I don't."" (Problems ranged from simple to idk to that doesn't even make sense.) I figured I needed the skills that help desk would provide me but I just ended up knowing it wasn't for me. As far as the webmaster assistant job (website management) it was tolerable at best. It was basically copy and paste skills with a basic understanding of HTML. I did a good job but I found myself bored and staring at the clock to hit 5. 

After 4 years of college and all this experience in I.T, I've developed no passions and a feeling of inadaquacy. The idea of working 40 hours a week at a job I dislike or even just find ""tolerable"" is kind of depressing. I know that's life but a ""life"" of doing something you'd rather not be doing seems sad. I can't think of any job I'd relatively enjoy let alone in I.T. It also doesn't help that I live in Los Angeles where the cost of living is so fucking high. Does anyone relate and have some advice? This ""work at a job you don't like until you die because you have to"" ideology is just something I can't accept. Thanks"

I think being practiced in technical interviews makes you better at solving problems and forming solutions for any programming problem, and even arguably *any* problem.

I'm in my junior year, currently in the middle of interviews for my third internship. This is the first year that I'm actually doing a lot of interviews. I think I've been much better at critical thinking and problem solving ever since I started doing frequent technical interviews. The general format of most technical interviews I've had is something like 1) you get a contrived question, 2) you make up a naive solution (*any* solution that works), and then 3) you make certain observations in your naive solution that lets you improve the solution, usually in terms of time or space efficiency. 

Specifically, I think technical interviews have taught me that, instead of instantly giving up and asking for help for the fear of having a crappy solution, I should improve upon the crappy solution instead, and logically reason about various improvements I can make. I've noticed that in solving problems (usually for my side projects), I'm diving right into Google/Stack Overflow much less than I used to.

So far, I haven't encountered interviews where you're expected to have the properties of some obscure data structure or Java API memorized. Have I just been lucky? "

I see internships as a test-run for my future.

The problem is that Google is doing things differently this year, where they have you accept the offer first and THEN they match you.  This means that you can end up at any of their offices with no clue!

They're going to be pushing for me to accept the offer soon.  I feel like it's really early, and I still have on-site interviews coming up in the next month.

:--|:--
[Given that this is far from the first time Richard has been told he is going to die only to find out otherwise, is there a possibility of an Eighth Amendment claim for your team? It appears officials didn't communicate with him as much as they should have (or at all\) about what was happening.  Also: what was it like to find out - after Richard had been scheduled to die - that he was granted a stay by the Governor (who refused multiple times to do so\) because of a problem with the drugs the DOC received? What do you think of the DOC's explanations of what happened in the hours leading to the stay?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpj95d?context=5)|I think what happened to Richard last Wednesday was cruel and unusual in every sense of that term. The officials did not communicate with Richard about what was happening and they did not communicate with his lawyers about what was happening. We all thought between the hours of 3 and 4 that he was being killed.  When we found out that there was a stay, it was literally as if Richard had risen from the dead. Of course we were all joyous, but that takes nothing away from the trauma we all felt in that hour when we knew (or thought we knew) that he was being killed by the state.
[How do you defend such crimes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphsqo?context=5)|Everyone deserves a good defense. Richard's case is a great example. The crime was horrible, but Richard did not commit this crime. It was poor lawyering that put him in this position. If he'd had good lawyers at the start, we wouldn't be having this discussion now -- he would be free.
[How do you feel about the validity of ""Mental illness"" as an excuse in court?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphsqo?context=5)|As far as the mental illness questions is concerned, it's not an excuse. Mental illness is real. It causes people to act in ways that they wouldn't if they were not mentally ill. We don't understand mental illness to the degree that we one day will.
[I understand that the entire legal process is super expensive.  Although you work pro bono, how is the defense being financed?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpiqe7?context=5)|This case has been financed through donations made on Richard Glossip's behalf. The donations have gone for the hiring of investigators, the costs of travel, and investigation. The most important thing that people need to understand is that very few Americans can afford the cost of a death penalty trial. That is why they're almost always done by public defenders. And that's why rich people never get the death penalty.
[On average, how expensive were your cases in the past?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpiqe7?context=5)|So if Richard Glossip can be killed by the state, we can all be killed by the state--unless you're rich.
[Where can we donate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpj7qo?context=5)|Here: [Link to fundly.com](https://fundly.com/save-richard-glossip#)
[I'm surprised you're able to do an AMA. I'd have assumed there would have been a gag order. You said something to the likes of 'if a jury ever heard your witnesses, Richard would be free' - why ""if"" and not ""when""? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpjpax?context=5)|By the time I got on this case, all of Mr. Glossip's appeals had been exhausted. We needed to find and present evidence of his actual innocence in order to get back into court. Two judges on the Oklahoma court of criminal appeals, agreed that we had presented enough new evidence of his innocence to warrant a hearing. If we'd had one more judge on our side, we would be back in court and would be able to present our evidence to a judge and perhaps to a jury on a later date.
[What would have to happen now for Fallin to extend the stay?  National large corporate/business boycott outrage?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpiove?context=5)|I hope that the government in Oklahoma recognizes that the entire world was watching as they were attempting to kill an innocent man. Despite that, they still made mistakes that should never have been made. If enough people contacted her donor base and express outrage over this attempt to kill an innocent man, I believe Governor Fallin would take notice.
[What do you think of the work of Maya Foa in trying to disrupt the access to drugs used in lethal injections?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpj5i4?context=5)|I think she's done a great job. Due to efforts like hers, I believe that lethal injection is on its way out. Doctors already do not want to perform this function, because it's against what doctors do. I believe that if we can get rid of this fallacy that the death penalty can be done cleanly and painlessly, more people would be revolted by it and it would end.
[Besides this one, is there one or two cases you've had as a public defender that have stuck with you? Successes (or failures / particularly difficult cases\) that continue to push you to do what you do? Can you tell us a little about them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpj5qn?context=5)|That's a tough question to answer in a short period of time.
 |My successes have come through really hard work. When you are asked to represent someone who will die if you're not successful, it's a terrible burden. It's the thought that my client might someday be killed that keeps me going. I never want to let that happen. And thankfully, to date, it hasn't.
[Do you feel like Mary Fallin's reasoning behind the stay of execution (questions around the protocol of lethal injection\) is skirting around the issue?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpi02x?context=5)|I think the problems that arose prior to the execution date regarding the drugs that Oklahoma had in its possession violated the protocol and were a valid reason for the stay. I hope that an honest investigation is conducted and we can all find out what actually happened with the drugs in the 48 hours leading up to the execution date.
[Mr. Knight,  does the box of destroyed evidence give Ricky any chance of appeal  or grounds for anything such as new evidentiary hearing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpip6k?context=5)|It is a big deal and we continue to look for ways to get this information in front of a court, however, we are at a stage in the process where many issues that could have been raised in courts are time-barred.
 |We hope we can find a way to get this information back in front of a court and we continue to look for ways to do so.
[What advice can you give for a law student who is torn between accepting a summer internship with the public defender's office or a medmal firm? Im feeling an ethical calling to the PDs office- but the big money of tort law looks real nice...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpii69?context=5)|What was it that made you want to be a lawyer in the first place? If it was money, go with the medmal firm. There's a lot of money there. Although, there's also a lot of good work to be done in that type of practice. If you want to do good work that helps a lot of people who really need help, i.e., poor people, be a PD. And then work your ass off.
[In your view â is lethal injection a violation of the 8th amendment?  Can you comment about your role in Glossip v. Gross and explain what the ramifications are for the new holding?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphtxn?context=5)|I did not have a role in Glossip v. Gross, that was a team of lawyers dealing only with the lethal injection issue. My role has been to uncover evidence of innocence and present it to the court. The lethal injection litigation is ongoing, especially in light of what happened last Wednesday.  To answer the question about the 8th amendment, yes, I believe that all forms of state-sponsored-homicide violate the 8th amendment. After what I witnessed last Wednesday, after being with Richard and his family as we all thought he was being killed, I can tell you that it was cruel and unusual in every sense of the word.
[Why do you believe he's innocent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpi8m8?context=5)|Because of the witnesses that I've been able to find. It's not what I believe that counts, it's what I believe I could establish in court. I have great witnesses. If a jury ever heard them, Richard would be free.
[We need to get this on Dateline. Have you received any interest from mainstream media like Dateline or 60 Seconds? Maybe we can create a social media bomb on Twitter/Instagram/Facebook and demand the media cover this story?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphrcl?context=5)|Mainstream media has covered this case. It has been in the NYTimes on several occasions. CNN and MSNBC have interviewed me as well, but yes, I think it makes a great story for Dateline or 60 Minutes and I would look forward to having them cover the case as well.
[What was your reaction when you heard Pope Francis &amp; Richard Branson were supporting Glossip? Were you surprised? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpim0s?context=5)|I was not surprised with Pope Francis. Lord knows I would hope he would be on our side. I was very happy that Richard Branson would lend his support. Who wouldn't want Richard Branson to support them?
[What is the plan to get him exonerated? Is there any other way through the courts to help? Or would it just be a PR campaign to put pressure on. My opinion as a marketer would be a viral video or campaign of some sort that can easily be shared.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpiuqn?context=5)|Yes. First, we're going to continue the investigation. As we uncover more evidence of innocence, we will be going back to court, but we also believe strongly that social media has a role to play and we want this case to get out to as many people as possible.
[What are the chances that he will be exonerated compared to similar cases?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphpke?context=5)|There are not a lot of similar cases. Cases of innocence in death row cases are not common. There's a lot of work to be done and with luck and help from everyone (and that means you) we can win.
[So you mean, this far down the road - chances are relatively slim?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvphs8s?context=5)|It's very difficult. I believe we have presented evidence of innocence, which is not easy to do. We continue to investigate and we will find more evidence and we will present that to a court.
[My wife (who's wearing a Notorious R.B.G shirt\) would like to know who is your favorite supreme court justice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpijtl?context=5)|That's classic! Stephen Breyer, because he voted for a stay of execution for Richard Glossip. Also, read his dissent in Glossip V. Gross for a great discussion of why the death penalty is unconstitutional today.
[*Stephen Breyer.*  Excellent choice! She's bookmarking his dissent for her evening reading after the kids are in bed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3nmz8w/i_am_don_knight_one_of_the_pro_bono_defense/cvpiu21?context=5)|Enjoy! Hurry before they make the movie!

To my surprise, I was offered a Facebook interview, then a Microsoft interview (both are internships).

MS is in 8-9 days (in-person). FB is in 17 days (phone).

These offers came in late last week, so I haven't had much time to prepare - I'm also balancing school work. A lot of the concepts seem really new to me, and I'm feeling pretty underprepared with only a few days to study.

I've been learning concepts fresh from Programming Interviews Exposed, and doing questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.

Does anyone have tips for how I should manage my precious time for the next couple weeks, and prep strategies/tips that might be really useful?

Thanks in advance!"

Luckily, my parents are fairly financially comfortable, so I don't need a job and can focus on getting a degree in Computer science. I'm at a community college but will transfer to a university soon.

My parents are worried that I'm taking too long to get a job, and think I should just get a job anywhere. They say that once I get a degree, unless I've worked somewhere, no one will be interested in hiring. They also keep saying that if I don't want to get a random, unrelated job, I need to pick a company I want to work for now to get a intern job at, even though I'm not even sure which branch of computer science I'm interested in, let alone which companies are best for which branches. If I were to choose a company now, it would be 100% based on what I like as a user and not an employee. Plus, no one would heir me as an intern because until I transfer, I can't take any more CS classes because the only ones my school offers is programming I and II, so I don't have the skills yet.
But, before I start sweating and throwing up from thinking about how to travel to a job and thinking about how stressful it will be for co-workers to depend on me, I was wondering if it really is worth it.

I've done a bit of googling, and what I've found is a bit mixed. Some sites said that unless it's related to the job you're applying for, you shouldn't even put other jobs on your resume. And, I'm worried that if I were to get a job, it would take all my time and attention to just focus on not freaking out and I won't be able relax enough to get through my classes. Frankly, just thinking about thinking about getting a job is making me put off school work a bit. (Generally, if I have to do something stressful, the only way to get through it is to turn my brain off and just do it, which is why I think it'd effect my schooling.)

I honestly am not trying avoid getting a job out of laziness. I have no problem with hard work. I usually did 75% or more of the group projects in CS classes, and I have a 3.5 GPA. I'm just really afraid of driving and getting lost on buses, and of being expected to do any physical work because of joint thing that causes me to get hurt a lot. If getting a job now really is important for getting a job in my field after I get my degree, I'll look into it, otherwise, I was thinking it would be best to focus on school. It seems to me, having good programming skills is more important to getting a programming job than working at McDonalds for a Summer. 

(Sorry if the post is too long. Thank you, if you took the time to read and consider it.)

I'm just looking for opinions, advice, and suggestions. "

**TL;DR waaaaaaaay at the bottom**

So, to business. My mother has been threatening to kick me out for about 2 months now. I am 19 so I'm about 99% sure she can. Several reasons why:


1.) My high school career was rocky. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 3rd-4th grade, I don't remember it too clearly, but after a while on medication my mother and grandparents didn't like how inactive and flat I was acting. Off meds and we never spoke about the diagnosis again. So for nearly 9 years I struggled through school, unaware of my situation and believing I was just a lazy brat who played too many video games, read too many books, and didn't do homework. I did big projects and I did very well on tests, and could have easily been a straight A student had I studied more and actually had motivation to do homework. I didn't feel challenged in school and by the time the material had ramped up, I had already blown off the homework that covered the basics so I was neck-deep once it came to challenging or interesting topics. It was very frustrating for my mother, who is a planner, while I take after my father who did everything as it came- no planning, just improvisation that usually ended well or at least with a lesson for next time to help him. I graduated well enough off in grades and had a very decent SAT score, enough to get me into my state's college. I had no idea what I was doing up there since I had always coasted by grades, and suddenly I needed to manage studying, homework, classes, waking up on time, social activities, etc, and I had not prepared myself. It was my fault. I failed my first semester and did exceedingly poorly second semester. I decided to stay home and go to a local branch campus for a year and live at home to get my head straight and in the groove. I now attend afternoon classes every other day, working the days I don't go to school. I was re-evaluated over the summer as well and am prescribed medication. The meds have had a very good effect, but with good comes bad. Mild insomnia, little to no appetite until late night, sometimes a queasy or jittery feeling as it wears off. I've talked to my doctor about it and we're trying stuff but for now, I need to keep trying, according to him. 


2.) I have trouble waking up in general, just a byproduct of being lazy, disinterested, and being a night person. I have trouble falling asleep and end up reading or binge watching a show. With the meds it's nearly impossible. It's like I have a switch in my brain when I wake up. Some days I can struggle out of bed, some days I don't even remember my alarms even though I've set 3-4. My mother has woken me up for work quite a bit. My job is in my college major at an office in the family business, basically learning as I go from my boss. I do work that he either doesn't have time to do or I am assigned with simple tasks that will increase productivity. My boss is not related to me, not anyone in the office save for my much older cousin who comes in about once a month for meetings. I love my job, I just hate waking up early. I know I need to, but once my short-lived motivation wears off I feel like I can't. I know I can, I just don't. I can't explain it.
Her waking me up now that I'm an adult and have responsibilities really ticks her off, and rightly so. She claims I'm just using my family name to have free income, and that I don't care.1 I don't know how to explain to her why or what happens, especially because she refuses to listen. 


3.) When I was 15, I started smoking cigarettes. By no means regularly, sometimes I'd have a pack last me 3-4 weeks, sometimes a few days. Sometimes I would go months without. When I was stressed out from school I'd get the urge, resist for a while, then break and use them to escape. When I turned 17, the friend who introduced me to smoking introduced me to electronic cigarettes. I started with the gas station disposables, then onto ego pens, then legitimate tanks, and onto RDA's and mod boxes once I was in college. I can count on my hand the number of cigarettes I've smoked since. I feel better, I can exercise freely now, and I am not tarring my lungs. The e-cig may not be 100% healthy and safe, but I am not ready to quit. I have been drastically lowering my nicotine intake, though. I like the vapor, I like building my coils and picking my flavors and wicking and playing with settings. It's a hobby to me and it's cathartic. But she wants none of it. My paternal grandmother smokes, has since she was 13. My paternal grandfather chews. My paternal aunts and uncles all smoke and chew. My paternal cousins fluctuate. My father smoked marijuana and had a run in with prescription meds that lead to his death, but we can tell that later. My mother raised my brother and I alone, acutely aware of the propensity towards addiction in our family. She sheltered is heavily from any negative influences, always told us about how bad it was, always complained that the cigarette smoke was setting off our asthma when we went to visit (which we didn't have, she invented this. Told us we had it and said it wasn't bad enough for inhalers. My doctor has confirmed that I was never diagnosed with it and my brother's is so minimal that it's nearly not worth acknowledging.). I was raised to hate tobacco and raised to be disdainful to anyone that used it. Once I found out that the people that did use tobacco weren't too bad, I tried it. She caught me smoking a few times and I got hell for it. I shook the trail for a year and a half, and about 6 months into using my e-cig she found out and tossed it. I was 18 at that point and discreetly bought a new one. Coming home from the most stressful year of my life, I got careless and was caught using it in the house. Ensue screaming match where I could not explain. So now that I'm found out, I don't really bother to hide it. Problem is, even though I don't do it in the house anymore, I still get yelled at for any fruity smell and it starts all over. 


4.) As I said above, my father passed away. I was very young, only in kindergarten, so I don't have a whole lot of memories. I have some very fond fragments of time with him, and some not so fond, but nothing horrible, just me being punished for being a brat. He had the same issues as me. He passed away from an incident with pain medication. I still have not been sat down and told the whole story; every time I think I've heard it all more gets added. At first, I just knew he died in his sleep. Then I found out he has sleep apnea and his throat closed while he slept. Then I learned that there was a malfunction with his CPAP machine. Then I was told the most recent story, that he was taking pain meds. Not like an addict, but like someone in massive pain. He took an extra every once in a while or would dose too quickly. One night he misjudged, and the painkillers mixed with sleep apnea caused his throat to close for good. He never woke up. While the pills were not an addiction, he had others. As I mentioned, he smoked marijuana. He did it though college and after I was born, although at a much lower rate. It became a pleasure thing rather than a tool to slow his mind to a normal speed. I will not lie, I do smoke. Not very frequently, not very much when I do, but I indulge once in a while. I have been caught up at college smoking, but it was brushed off as an ""everyone tries it, don't make it a habit"" deal. So I haven't. Once a month tops, sometimes with longer gaps. As of today it's probably been around 3.5ish months. But to the topic, since he has passed away, she is deathly afraid of losing my brother and I. Anything even slightly dangerous was a resounding ""No"". Anything unwholesome was censored. I didn't have steady access to the internet until I was about 16. I didn't play Call of Duty until I was 15, and only then because it was a gift from my aunt and uncle and she didn't want to be rude. I'm not saying it's like a hallmark of childhood, I wasn't deprived, but it just alienated me from my friends. Many of my friends played Call of Duty or Battlefield or Bioshock or other things like that. I didn't have access to purchase my own games until I was 16-17ish and built my own computer. At first I wasn't allowed to own them, then I wasn't able to go to my friends houses because they'd be playing them, and then I wasn't allowed to be friends with them for a short period of time because they would turn out violent and deranged. She's a big fan of Fox News. I was cyberschooled for 2 years because my high school was iffy because of the county locations and districts. I was ostracized. I barely had friends except for in Scouts. My old friends had already forgotten me because I had been slowly disappearing anyways. It was hell. Afterwards I went to a catholic school. So after realizing I was kind of a nerdy loser in my previous school, I resigned to being the aloof bored kid in high school. I was smart; if called on I knew the answers and could respond eloquently enough that the teacher would let me go back to sleep. I had a gift for impressing adults, but I couldn't make friends. It was a close knit private school and I was an outsider, and I was terrified to go back in and become a loser, so until senior year when I met someone who was like me and put on too cool for you airs, and a kid that didn't give a shit what people thought, I had no strong friendships to speak of outside of my scout troop. I never went to anyone's house or party or even after school food runs. I was on sports teams and she always supported me, went to all my track meets and cross country meets, but I went straight home after. No going for dinner to celebrate a win with friends, just right home. I had 2 girlfriends and lost both of them within weeks because we never hung out. My mom was still very ""plan in advance"", and I'd get shot down instantly if I asked to go anywhere after school without a few days notice and people quickly learned I wasn't any fun. I wasn't 100% secluded, I still had a few friends who went to my school, one who I knew since I was born, but he was a year younger and had other friends by this point. Basically it was too late to make a best friend or group of best friends or even worm my way in as an acquaintance. My two great friends from senior year were transfers too. I dated a girl from my old karate studio for 2.5 years and just recently broke up with her, it was seriously the longest term I've had a friend in a long time. 


5.) She wants nothing more than for us to succeed and be happy. In theory, it sounds good. But the problem is, her ideal of successful and happy differ from mine. My idea of successful is making money to support myself, have enough for a future family to live comfortably without wants or needs, and to spend some time playing video games or reading a book or just being with friends. I'm an Eagle Scout, I love camping and I'm used to crappy situations. She can't go camping without an RV with a generator and flushing toilets. I like making things up as I go, she plans her trips to the restroom a half hour in advance. She likes a schedule and an itinerary and 2 backup plans. I hate planning in advance unless it's a big deal like a trip or something of that sort. She wants me to wake up at 7:30,  go to college at 9am, earn straight A's, work on homework until 9pm, then go to bed at 10pm nice and early for the next day. I feel like that's a waste of my life. Sure, I might not make millions, but with the skills I learn from college, plus the head start I have with an internship in sophomore year, I will be able to live more than comfortably. Ideally, I would keep my current job until I am on par with my boss, then take his job once he retires. There is nobody in the office with the skill set that he has and that I am acquiring, so I am not stepping on toes of someone waiting for a promotion, and I work hard. I earn my money. My uncle, the current owner, instructed my boss to treat me like any other trainee: if I slack off or do poorly, he can fire me, no questions asked. No repercussions. But she doesn't see that, she only sees that I'm having trouble waking up. She doesn't see what I want, only what makes her feel like she succeeded at being a parent. In short, my decisions are mad by her, for her, and I'm just a tool to do them for her. Sure, I chose things. I chose my clothes, what my classes are, etc. But I have no idea how to do taxes, I don't know how to cook except rudimentary meals, I can barely do laundry because she's afraid I'll mess it up. She didn't even let me get my drivers permit until I was 17, (16 is legal age in my state, 16.5 is driving age) mainly because she was afraid to teach me. I got my license a few months before my 18th birthday and was still kept from driving because I wasn't prepared yet, despite having earned my license. The only way for me to learn is to do. Talk theory all day and I'll stare at you blankly. You let me actually do it once and I can deconstruct, reconstruct, and analyze all day. I don't want to be a paper pusher at a 9-5 day in and day out. I don't want to spend all my damn time making money so I can put it away and not spend it. I don't know what's going to happen and I want to enjoy it as long as I can and I sure as hell know I won't enjoy 40 years of files and sales. I'm doing programming because I get to design new things every day and I love solving the puzzle, but getting to make the pieces too. 


6.) She doesn't want to let go of charge. All her life, her parents did what she did to me. She complained about curfew, about ludicrous rules, how she was bossed around in college. She was the perfect daughter. Never got in trouble, never did anything wrong. Always the responsible older sister. She never drank alcohol til she was 21, she married my dad a virgin, etc. You get the picture. So any time I have a problem, it's ""I NEVER had *that* problem"" or ""because my parents did it"" or my favorite ""this is my house and you will follow my rules or you can get out.""  She has not had a job since she became a stay at home mom to raise us. Before that she was a teacher and my dad was a manager at family business. At this point, we live off of my father's healthy shareholdings. We never want, but she acts like she's the one bringing in the cash. ""My money, My house, my car, my food, my whatever."" I wonder how many single moms would kill to be in her position, and she squanders it. Our house is a mess, we have too many things from antique shows or qvc. My bedroom is nigh unlivable because she shoved all of her things in there while she painted her room and only moved back the things she wanted.  Every aspect of our house is such a mess. Not hoarders bad, but getting there. The messes are blamed on her not having any time, what with raising us, but my brother has his license now, he isn't a ""troublemaker"" like me. He wakes up on time, does his homework, and get the grades. I live at home with as little interaction as possible. After school or work I go straight upstairs to my computer, get on Skype with my friends, play League of Legends and whatever other games we use as filler while we wait for enough for a full team. I get my work done. I get my paycheck. I am productive and do not rely on her for anything but groceries, which I have the time to do but usually am not required to except for the occasional run to the local minimart for buns or milk or a low condiment. She knits and talks on the phone, and cleans a room by moving the mess to another room. We have had 3-4 rooms renovated in the past 5 years. Redone living room, her bedroom, the old baby room became the laundry room, my room was repainted and refinished, our glass solarium became a 30x30 foot room that was supposed to be a sun room with a fireplace and some furniture, but it just stores things that she refuses to throw away because she thinks she'll clean it out in the next few days or so and put everything where it ""should be."" It should be at the curb for trash. We have more ""antique"" utensils, tools, machines, and food tins than she knows where to put them. We have done several cleaning days where we pick a room and clean it, but it ends up with by brother and I tossing our things and just moving heavy furniture to a new place where it is clutter instead of decoration. My family brings it up monthly and is met with, ""It's my next project,"" or, ""I didn't have time this week,"" or, ""The boys were too lazy to help me and I just couldn't all by myself."" Meanwhile she shows up every other week with an end-table sized rickets load of garbage that used to be for grinding corn silk into paste or for cutting an old shoe into leather strips. Things that invariably encroach on living space. I haven't done anything with my friends inside my house in probably 5 years because I'm embarrassed of what it looks like. And yet she's the boss, and if she wants another useless trinket to waste money on, then she gets it. She will come up with some pretty ingenious projects for them, get half way through, and then let them collect dust.

 I have lost control of all aspects of my life except what she allows me to control. I'm scared to be on my own. I have never done it before. I believe that I *can* do it, but I would much rather solve this without excommunicating myself. My grandparents who usually take my side are going to be informed shortly, but I don't know whether I can count on them for actual help. Sure, I could crash in their spare bed for as long as I want, but if I leave, I'm leaving with dignity. I'm leaving the one who comes out on top. I abso-fucking-lutely refuse to come crawling back. I have not a care in the world whether pride is clouding my judgement because for the first time in my life, it'll be my decision. Not an idea I had that she molded, or an idea I was coerced into, or an idea that was blamed on me when it went wrong, or an idea that was mine and resold as hers. I want to go against her wishes and win, as much for me as it is for her. I really do love her. I really do. She did her best, and she did it alone, and I respect her immensely for that. But I need to stop being coddled. If I can't do it by myself, then I'll do what she says. But if I can live on my own and make money, I'm going to. I'll put away money, save up, and I guess I'll have to attend community college. But I'll do it my way for once.

So, Reddit, I make $1,750 a month after income tax. Getting a $760 a month lease, is that too much? I'll be looking for a roommate but the first month will most definitely be alone.  And does anyone have some tips? I don't want to have to do this but if she kicks me out, I will live on the streets before I ever live there again. I refuse to back down on this. Thank you guys. If you need info feel free to ask, I'll send it if I can. My car insurance will be about $140-$175, gas for said car will be about $70 a month to and from work, including some time for social things. Utilities altogether for the apartment is estimated by residents about $120 in the winter and $90 in summer, curving up and down with climate. Water is free.  My health insurance and phone are not my mom's payments, but my grandparents' and company plan, respectively. My medication is $30 a month. After being in Scouts, I've learned to skimp out but still be healthy for food. I can feed myself very well for about $150-175 a month. Internet is included, but if possible I'd like to upgrade at some point if I can afford it. This leaves about $400 leftover at the end of each month. My goal will be to save up because I'm sitting on only a summer and a half's worth of salary, plus some unused graduation money, plus a few things here and there where I can pull in cash. I'm pretty good at mixing e-cig liquid, and I have a multitude of friends who would buy from me instead of stores because of a much cheaper price, their pick of whatever flavor mix, and helping support a friend. Costs about $1.50-$2.00 to make a 30 mil bottle, and a usual $30 mil goes between $18 and $25 depending on quality. So assuming I do this, I'll have no nicotine expenses because it'll pay for itself as long as I can sell it under the table for about $12-$15 a bottle. Breaking even on supplies is about $30-40. I have friends who go through 45 mil a week, so the price reduction will definitely be welcome. At least 3 have guaranteed they'd by from me at least weekly and several who said at least bi-weekly. This isn't a business, just a way to pull some extra cash just in case. Anybody with tips on finding a roommate, living affordably, and just anything in general, please share. Anyone with advice on how to avoid the situation all together, please, please *please* share.


**TL;DR:** My mother and I have been butting heads over college, living, my job, time management, and a bunch of other small things that add up to a lot. She is legitimately threatening to kick me out. I'm attempting to hash out a basic game plan in case this does not get resolved, mainly so I can leave on my terms and not hers, as well as only having to crash at a friends or grandparents' for a week at most. I want to come out of this successful. I do not want to come crawling back home after a few months, where forever after I'll have to hear her brag and command. I cannot afford to fuck up, literally and figuratively. "

Like usually when my friend ask me out for a random hangout even though I'm quite low on financial or that time when my parents decided to sent me to a random college, annd I would say 'Yea/Sure' ,yea that kinda of guy.

Sooo I started my internship 3 days ago. My friend works in this company so I figured, hey why not so I went ahead,submitted my cv, and got the intern. One thing though, the travel distance between my place and my workplace is quite far. Also the internship is 6 months long. I finished my degree in IT &amp; Multmedia Computing and this company deals with After Effects but well, I kinda slacked a lot during my college years(yeaaaaa...). I really dont know whats going on most of the time and doubting my choice of doing my intern here but the guys here are cool with it. Today my collegemate pm me over facebook saying there is a better intern closer to my home. So I sent an email and surprisingly the HR called me half an hour later asking if I'm still available for intern.  I said yes. I asked my supervisor if it is ok to stop my internship as the current work is irrelevant to my degree course and travel distance etc. He says ok as well. So basically I will restart my internship next week. 

Thing is, I always do these shenanigans that it is getting to me. Like I would do this caz of Person A saying its good or that caz Person B said so. I feel like I'm screwing up my life at this rate with this sort of mindset :/ 

TLDR: An undecisive guy making decisions mostly based on friend/majority opinion. Even decision concerning about my life."

I really like what I do and in the future I would be excited to move on to more interesting stuff. Concurrence, machine learning... I dont know, I would love to progress towards something cool or more advanced.

However, all of my interning experience is related to web dev and my first job will probably have to be about that too, since that's what is most demanded for what I've seen so far. This is made worse by the fact that I will have trouble relocating due to personal circumstances.

Do you think that stacking experience with web development is good? Or do you think I should avoid working with technologies like JavaScript/Python (as opposed to Java for example) to prevent a dead end?

TL;DR - will a Law degree from Portugal and a Master's from the Netherlands (Intl. Trade and Investment Law) bar me from looking for something, in that field, in the UK? Will a compliance graduate job be that geographically specific?

---

This is a throwaway account because privacy. Or perhaps I just want to hide my post record in reddit's underbelly. See, *privacy*.

This might be a very confusing post because, well, I am quite confused at the moment. Maybe confused isn't the right word, as I do know what I like (or what I *think* I like), and I've had some past experiences with it - it's just that I'm dazed with all the possibilities (or lack-thereof) and I'm feeling quite insecure about some of the things I previously had as certain.

I graduated, with distinction, from Law School early in July. I was among the top 10% in class (perhaps even more so, 10% amounts to ""First"" in the Portuguese system and, therefore, is a mere category) in, arguably, the country's leading Law School (not getting specific here because it's a small place and I'd risk being tracked down).

During my time as a bachelor student I was an intern at two big-shot law firms (one of them an international law firm) and I also worked as a Summer intern, for one month and a half, at a consultancy firm in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (where I had previously spent 6 months on an exchange programme). 

Most people don't get the chance to do an internship while Law undergraduates (many end up working in another field when they graduate - our youth unemployment rates are self-evident) in Portugal, let alone do something in overseas, and I hold myself lucky for that. But I did work hard to get those chances.

During those three stints of mine, I was, almost randomly, thrown into compliance teams, part of broader corporate law practice groups (except for the consultancy). I can't get specific but I mostly worked with financial compliance, as well as privacy protection regulatory compliance in the consumer finance industry. I did some work for the auto industry as well. On a support role, obviously, but you can only expect so much from a 21 year old, I'd say.

This had mainly to do with Portuguese law, of course, but I was mostly working with Portuguese law derived from European directives and regulations. In Brazil I mainly dealt with regulatory research and the odd Portuguese-to-English translation of regulatory frameworks.

I could find something in Portugal, especially as a lawyer - and I was invited for the places I interned at. I don't want that though. I can't stand the idea of working from 9 to 11 (p.m) and come back home with some meager 1500â¬/m for the next 4 years, plus some ridiculous vacation time - and that's if you work in a top law firm. In fact, those 1500â¬ are considered a very, very good salary in Portugal. Things are that bad. Come to think of it, they've always been.

I decided I could try look elsewhere. While most stayed back home, pursuing their master degrees (a master/LL.M. is pretty much mandatory for a lawyer back there - it's a way of specializing and many only start working after that), I decided to enroll myself in a LL.M at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, (Trade and Investment Law) and try my luck abroad. I would have preferred the UK but current British tuition fees aren't made for a broke ass guy coming from a broke ass family like me.

That's where I am today. I'm mostly focusing on my master degree and improving my CV further at the moment - I recently got a certificate from Harvard Law School on American Copyright law (an experimental online course at that, being offered for free to foreign students who qualify, but still) and I'm representing my University at a WTO competition earlier next year. 

My idea for the last year and a half was to broaden my, well, geographical limits - Law is a sort land-locked degree. You do need to make an effort to break yourself free from that. 

And, with that, we have arrived to the crux of my doubts - can I ever break free from that?

I've applied for a bunch of UK graduate programmes, mostly in the financial industry - BOA, HSBC, DB and so forth. They're all meant for aspiring compliance &amp; risk officers: but isn't there an inherent bias towards British graduates? Or, at least, graduates from English-speaking countries/common law jurisdictions?

Obviously they never say such thing in all vacancy notices ... but should I expect that? On one hand, most compliance work is learned on the job, and you do need to be familiar with legal analysis, but in the end that's it, not to mention much of today's financial regulation comes from the EU. But, on the other hand, it's English jurisdiction we're still talking about - and, of course, there's the whole ""non-Native English speaker"" thing: even if you're a fluent speaker.

It's a long shot asking you this out here but, who knows, maybe there's someone around. 

Thank you - and sorry for the wall of text.

I avidly told them that I could still drop classes for this semester and just rearrange my schedule so that it wouldn't interfere next semester.

They then decided to tell me that they use computers for a lot of things and that they could really use me for help with them. The catch they were only offering an UNPAID internship.

But then again, I want to check out Microsoft to see if I like it, and they don't have interviews for full-time conversion. (This will be my post-junior-year internship.)

I don't really care about compensation as much--both offer amazing benefits and perks. Google is the ""cool"" company, but Microsoft seems to be doing a lot of cool things lately, especially with the Surface. I was a little taken aback by the feel of Microsoft's campus though. Google's offices are really open and everything feels fun and collegey. Microsoft has closed offices and looks more corporate. Just a bunch of buildings with little character. I know this shouldn't really matter when I'm deciding on a good *job*, but I can't help it. It makes it feel more like...an office? Like work? Corporate? Less fun? Google feels more social. Also, I like Seattle, but I don't think I could live there long term. Still, the work they're doing seems interesting and it's different.
 
Has anyone here interned for both companies or knows people who have? What have you heard? What are your experiences with these companies?

And no, I don't go to a target school, so there's not a lot of people I could ask about this.

**Edit:** For both companies, I would have to accept before I'm matched to a team.

**Edit2:** Any Microsoft interns want to share their experiences?

**Edit3:** Thanks for the input guys! I'm now giving Microsoft more consideration now, especially since I liked Seattle a lot more than Mountain View. Redmond is still a downside though."

I (21F) have been in a relationship with a girl (19F) for four years.  We started dating my Senior year of high school and I am currently in my Senior year of college.  

My freshman year of college, so three years ago, my mother walked into us kissing and freaked out.  I told my mother that I was a lesbian and that was it and the next six months of my life turned to hell.  Screaming everyday, throwing and breaking shit, the works.  It reached a point where my mother told me I had to stop with this and never talk about the girl again, or get out of the house.  (I was currently staying home, commuting to college about fifteen minutes from me.)  So after talking about it with my girlfriend, I walked ""back into the closet"" and told my mom I was straight and it was all a mistake.  

Since then it has been sneaking around.  My mother has confronted me many, many times about it over the last three years and I always just reassure her that I am straight.  

A year after she threatened to kick me out, I was able to move away for college.  This has made my life a lot easier.  I am graduating in May with a Business degree and have been really successful in my college career now that I am away.  (Great GPA, really involved, fun paid internship.  It is a step up from the 2.7 I had in college when I was home.)  

My parents have supported me financially all through college.  I told them I would get loans, etc. but my mother would always decline.

After I graduate I would like to be myself.  Not have to worry about them and the hate and emotionally abusive environment I was in since even before all of this.  (Since I was about 10) I have a place to live, and am focused on finding a great career, but I don't know how to tell them or when to tell them or anything like that. 

My girlfriend said she would go with me, be with me, anything like that when I tell them.  but I just don't know how.  I think part of me feels guilty.  

A few others questions to add.

What documents should I make sure that I have? I already have social security card, but should I get birth certificate, etc.?

When should I change my address? Will they know if I do this?  

Anything else that I am not thinking about?

Thank you for all your help!

TL;DR: My parents found out I was gay three years ago, and then pushed me back in the closet.  How do I cut ties with them in May when I'm done with college?

**First off, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/vXyRHr0.jpg). If you don't want to read all those words below, simply general feedback is appreciated!**

So I recently returned from China where I was teaching English for a year, and now Iâm looking to get a âreal jobâ. As youâll see, I was an education major, but Iâve come to the realization (way too late, but thatâs for another subreddit I guess) that I donât want to be a teacher; Iâm mostly going for program/ event coordinator positions at a non-profit (related to education a plus given my background) or corporate training positions. Think jobs like Training and Development Associate, Training Coordinator, etc.

Iâve sent out between 40-50 applications since mid July with resumes that pretty much [look like the one above](https://i.imgur.com/vXyRHr0.jpg). Iâve had mild success. Iâve had 5 first round interviews out of these applications, but they end up moving on with other candidates who I presume are better qualified. Maybe it's my interviewing skills that I should be working on, but making my resume better canât hurt either.

**Areas for Improvement:**

I can feel that the wording of some of my bullets are lousy, but Iâve been staring at it for so long that I donât know how to improve it. For example, I canât think of any ways to put more metrics into my positions. None of my positions were great for things like, âincreased my business numbers by 20%.â

Also, my internship at the insurance company sticks out as not as relevant to what Iâm going for. How do I make it work? I was mostly working in Excel/ the companyâs proprietary software doing data entry projects, so maybe I could try to spin it as âdata analysisâ, the ability to learn a new system quickly, or at least basic computer literacy? Thatâs pretty much what Iâve been expressing in cover letters.

Other than that, Iâm happy to hear your general feedback. Thanks! "

I used to work in a Mass Spectrometry lab as an intern. Because of the cost of the equipment, and the degree of training required to use it, I didn't do a lot. Most of my day was spent sitting around, doing nothing full time. Normally it would've been great, but the constant thrumming of the vacuum pumps nearly drove me insane. To pass the time, I'd spend a lot of time on reddit, or playing video games, or learning how to code. Until this one time...

My mentor gave me a flash drive with several .txt files, full of data output from the Synapt, one of our machines. He told me to take a look at it, and copy several thousand entries to Excel for processing. Amazed, I asked if that was how it had always been done, and he said yes. I cringed at the thought of so many man hours being wasted with turning that data into a useable form. So, instead of starting to copy the entries, I sat down and started reading up on Visual Basic for Excel. 

After about 2 days of reading up on Excel, I wrote my first macro, only to have it fail spectacularly. It took about 2 more days of troubleshooting and rewriting, but in the end I had a program that could extract the data from the Synapt's output. Feeling pretty proud of myself, I brought the output (which I had been given a week and a half to finish, because it was a massive amount of data), and forwarded the macro to my mentor for future uses. 

Impressed at this, he gave me more advanced output, told me what to extract, and I got to work writing the new macro. This one, with my prior experience, took about 3 days to write and troubleshoot, and in the end there was only one obstacle I couldn't overcome(which was entirely aesthetic, he wanted a row added when the number in a certain column changed, which I'm sure there was a way to do, but when I tried to implement it, the code would hang). Of course, I was berated for not being able to deal with that one thing, because it's not like I saved them hundreds of man hours in the future.

I love gaming and especially PC gaming, but I have had less and less time for gaming recently. I am a junior at college, in a relationship, picked up exercising, take care of two dogs, and am currently internship hunting. Since May, I have probably played fifty or sixty hours worth of games.

Right now I have it in my head to purchase a Cooler Master V750 so I have a more powerful PSU to OC my GPU and CPU as well as the AOC 24inch freesync monitor to take advantage of more than 60fps. I want them, but I am happy with my current set up. 

With life the way it is now, is it really worth putting more money into my PC when I have maybe 4 or less hours a week to play games? Moreover, no game has really appealed to me since The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and before that was Battlefield 3. I mostly play WoW every now and again with friends. Is it worth upgrading?

I realize that it is probably not a good idea given my situation, but it always helps to hear from other people. "

The only concrete resources I've found are the ""get that job at Google"" blog post, the Google technical development guide for students, and a great talk by a UBC student [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8) who was on academic probation for four years and still interned at 2 of the Big 4. These are great jumpoff points but it would be nice to find more resources. What top companies expect their interns or new hires to know. That kind of knowledgebase has been harder to find for me, especially for startups. What does Dropbox want their interns to know? What does Uber want their interns to know? 

If I learn from the best, but don't necessarily set my sights that high, it will still pay dividends. Maybe I won't be able to get an internship with those companies for summer 2016, but for summer 2017 who knows?

For personal projects, I have three tangible ideas I'm either working on right now or planning to in the next few days. 

* One is a Reddit app that its developer abandoned, but needs to be updated to oAuth2 (Reddit changed its API to oAuth2) using prawoauth2. 

* Another is a sort of Glassdoor/Angel.io clone that would catalogue all the tech companies (including corporations and startups) in one specific city and allow users to anonymously report what they've heard about the company via beer chats or ""word on the street"" (e.g. ""people are questioning if XYZ company's VC funding is evaporating""). I found that I was only finding this grapevine information on the local subreddit for my hometown, and not on Glassdoor or Angel.co. It would not be a sophisticated site at all but it would also help me learn Javascript skills since I want to use this as a platform to learn bleeding-edge web design.

* Go through the nand2tetris course to get a cursory understanding of systems programming and digital logic.

Other ideas I have are (extremely) basic projects in high-performance/parallel computing, data science, scientific/mathematical computation and modelling, doing something cool with the Facebook/Twitter/Reddit API buying an Arudino or Raspberry Pi kit and tinkering around with it, joining the /r/learnprogramming Github, checking out the Odin Project, etc. But the three previous ideas seemed more actionable to me, as in something that will get me off my ass and doing something. And I haven't forgotten Hacker Rank and Topcoder and other sites for fundamentals. I already did the boring bureaucracy work and got accounts at Github, Linkedin, Hacker Rank and Glassdoor. The hard part will be making any use of them."

It seems to me that as you move up the major requirements, towards the more advanced courses, more and more students appear to drop their level of comprehension...

Sorry, I'm really bad at explaining things so maybe I'll give some examples instead. Almost every year, I have one of my CS friends complain to me that they met someone or they were partnered with someone who did not know how to use the command line, had never used common tools like vim, git, etc., lacked basic knowledge or struggled with foundational things like traversing arrays, or even all of the above. I also hear horror stories during their internships, of students from Berkeley and even Stanford who did not know how to use a UNIX terminal. 

It seems that some students were deprived of a solid foundation. Then you start having students who, even though they can pass a class, start developing wider and wider gaps in knowledge - gaps that could have been narrowed if only that foundation had existed. 

Whats going on? Is it that students are becoming lazier and lazier? I don't believe that at all. I feel like most people at UCSD are very intelligent and possess a thirst for knowledge. Is it the pressure of graduating on time? The pressure to graduate with a well paying degree?

I'm a 19 year old student, and am a beginner programmer who has the option to attend a Programming Bootcamp where they teach either FullStack Web development or Android development. It is a course with an internship opportunity, so seems like a great deal to be a part of.

The path they offer are as follows:

In the FullStack path there is - HTML, CSS, JavaScript w/ jQuery, and finally Ruby and the Rails.

And, In the Android path - Java, XML etc

Despite being a newbie in this field I do posses some introductory knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from doing online drills on sites like Code Academy, Free Code Camp, Tree House etc, and also know the very basics of Android Studio from doing Google's Intro class at Udacity, and watching random YT videos.

After getting a small taste I gotta have to say I do find them both interesting, but the Web dev path kind of stands up to me a little more. The concept of combining many different languages-frameworks-libraries to create a unique web based application seems really cool. And not to mention the many new assorted JavaScript concepts people are coming up with nowadays feels like quite a fun-addictive process to tinker with. But I also have my affection for Android as well starting from Nexus, the ROMs, customizability, Material Design, big growing market full great apps out there etc.

So yeah that's about it. Some of the deciding factors for me are the availability of Jobs, and the starting salary of the respective roles in a Junior dev position (I'm from NY). The potential growth and longevity matters as well, but getting a Job is my number one priority. Now that I've completely fallen in love with coding/programming there is just no going back for me, but to succeed here in this field.

Please feel free to help me out folks, and thanks for your time. Cheers!"

Throwaway for obvious reasons &amp; I hope i got the right subreddit (if not, if you could redirect me?)
To start, I recently returned from a year abroad for university and was scared that what is happening, would happen. Just FYI, this is just an overview, so if there are any questions, please feel free to clarify.

* Family:
Since overseas, my parents separated (not mutual, but they were a not compatible and i can't remember the last time it was a happy household, it came no surprise to me, but did for my narcissistic mother) but even then i couldn't escape it. I have always been (or felt I was) the person who was there to listen, provide advice, make others laugh when they were down and I wanted to offer support where I could. My older sister went through a tough time and was diagnosed with depression (runs in the family), but at the same time is quite selfish and is currently only looking out for her best interests no matter how it affects people around her. I spent countless days listening to her, being with there when she cried and to keep motivating her. 
I live at home with my mum and sister (like most students in my city)and know moving out would be a great option- IT WOULD- but I am paying for university upfront and live in a very expensive city, and don't work anywhere near enough to do that. 

* Friends:
My friends have never been the type to organise anything. After making some incredible friends abroad, coming back to the same old shit, I decided for once I was not going to organise anything and see if they would contact me or initiate anything. Nope. 
I'm not an overly dependent person, or even emotional for that matter, but it would be nice to see your friends. They always looked to me for advice, a laugh, etc., treated me a bit like a group 'leader' but never ask what's happening to me. They're not bad people, just lazy and uninspiring. I really miss my friends from overseas, for once, I was the one always being invited by them, shown appreciation and felt I could really be myself. They all live on the other side of the world and skyping is great, but i miss hanging out with them.

* Work:
On the workfront, I dislike my job, I have been applying relentlessly for jobs, internships and unpaid work experience opportunities, but have had only a few phone interviews which have not worked out for whatever reason. I would say that I am fairly intelligent, but I don't have the current work experience that will allow me to apply for roles although I have other things going for myself (volunteering, languages, extra curricular, leadership programmes etc).

* University:
I have never felt so lost. I'm 75% through my degree and I have a little idea what I want to do, but know it will not leave me satisfied or happy. I have always dreamed of creating a start up, but am feeling uninspired and lack creative tendencies. 

* Me: 
I really enjoy being alone sometimes- People always describe me as a happy, funny (somewhat sarcastic), ambitious person, but sometimes I just want to be left alone for weeks. I have moments where I imagine just packing up and leaving, and that honestly makes me excited. I vowed to do it after I finished university anyway, but there are alot of toxic or useless people in my life that I just want to cut off, but I feel like I am being petty.
Inside, I really am not that happy and I just want to run away and start a new life. I feel trapped and I know it may seem so easily fixable to some, but I just feel stuck and would sincerely appreciate any advice.

Sorry for the length!

I was supposed to go into pharm school but dropped it. I went back for undergrad CS degree because I felt computer science is something I'd rather do. I'm now currently in my 1st sem of CS and according to my degree plan... I have 3 full years to graduate (without overloading with hours and taking summer courses). And that's with all my core classes taken care of.

I'm only taking 15 hours now and all the math is getting to me. I know I can push forward though, because I struggled a bit during my biology undergrad too. That aside, someone mentioned to me that I should ditch college altogether since I already have a degree. And that I should go to CS boot camps to learn what I need to learn. I mean, it makes sense, saving time + large amounts of loan... but I can only assume finding a cs related job without an actual cs degree is going to be hell. I don't consider myself special or someone that stands out by any means, so I'm hesitant to drop this major. I know I'd want to look into getting an internship too, but isn't it impossible without being IN school?

I have been lurking /r/cscareerquestions for a year now, and I finally have the opportunity to ask questions.

I just found out from my school email that Microsoft will be attending my university. There will be a coding competition, recruiters, human resource agents(?), and managers(?).

The recruiters will also be reviewing resumes, and we will have the chance to drop our resume off. I do not have a resume.

**My programming experience:**

* I am comfortable with basic data structures in Java and C++.

* I am comfortable with Git, but I do not have anything to show in my GitHub.

I know my chances are **very** slim, but I still want to use this opportunity to gain more knowledge (and hopefully get an internship).

How exactly would I go about making a resume with very minimal programming experience? How do I prepare in a month to impress recruiters? 

Also, I am sure that this varies, but generally speaking, what exactly would I wear to such an event? I will definitely ask around tomorrow, but I want to get some responses.

Any other tips? Thanks in advance!"

So I interviewed with company A about 2 months ago. The position I interviewed for was given to somebody else, but I was given a interview for a position that was ultimately better. After the 2nd interview and was told they wanted to go a different direction with position 2.

a few weeks later I went to a conference and met a representative of company B, and was told to to contact him if I were interested in a paid internship. I got in contact with him and he told me that the company was moving offices and it would be better to wait until the move was done in about 3-4 weeks.

3-4 weeks passed and I contacted company B again. A internship is still on the table but the won a contract and are moving to a Data center instead of the office they planned on before. So they want me to wait another month.

The day after I contacted company B the second time, company A called me and we set up a third interview (a informal coffee meeting) for the better position.

I did my research on both companies, both are excellent. I feel company B may be a better fit for me and have better opportunities down the road, but I think company A is going to offer me a better starting position. Neither have made any formal offers (no paper work) but I have a feeling company A will make an offer soon.

I would still like to explore opportunities with company B, how should I go about that? Should I just tell them I have been interviewing with another company, but would still like to explore opportunities with them? how can I do it without seeming un-professional or pushy?"
3o2b9p,0,2015-10-09,Depressed about my Future.,backwardinduction1,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/3o2b9p/depressed_about_my_future/,"I'm feeling generally, anxious, stressed, and depressed after my first 6 weeks of grad school. While I won't tell you guys what exact shcool I go to in order to keep their reputation safe, I just feel like I need to vent and get some advice. I go to a top ranked school of public health for an MS in environmental health. My utlimate goal is to get a PhD, but for public health schools you almost always need a masters degree before you can even get into a PhD program.

I'm worried for two reasons:

1. I have the option to feed into the main doctoral program as a third year after the compleion of my master's degree, provided that I actually get in to that much more competitve program that has half as many spots as my current program (or possibly less based on departmental changes I've noticed). If I do this I continue on with my studies, do my dissertation and finish after a total of 5 years at the school. If I go to a different school for my PhD, it will probably take me 5 years there, so a total of 7 years of grad school.

2. I'm not fully sure I want to go into this specific area/field of public health or continue with public health after my masters. I'm extremely interested in GIS and urban planning, and while I'll have opportunities to take elective courses in these fields, I wonder if getting a PhD in those fields would be a better fit for me. Of course GIS oozes its way into every field, including mine in some circumstances, so I know it'd help me. Theres a lot of overlap between environmental health and urban planning, so I have hope that something will work out, but I'm not sure what will happen, and the uncertainty of it all, and the fact that I'll have to apply for things next fall is stressing me out.

I started doing lab-work for this one research project going on at my school. I wouldn't exactly call it research per se as its just lab work, and its related to air-exposure-assessment, so I have my doubts about whether deciding to it was a good idea or not. It pays well, which is a nice enough incentive, but would something like this be at all valuable for the future thats going to collide with me sooner or later whether I like it or not?

Just all the stress of keeping my grad school grades up, trying to be a competitve PhD applicant, trying to progress to do actual research by the time the spring roles around, trying to figure out what I want to do with my summer (we have to either do research or an internship then) and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life is just giving me a lot of mental anguish. 

What do I do?

The reason why I am asking is that the company that I interned at last summer wants a decision by the end of October/early November, but I have applied to a bunch of other companies I would *much* rather work at and have not heard back yet (My previous internship had an extremely toxic atmosphere - someone once interrogated me if I had posted a negative review about the company to glassdoor or not - wtf right?).


Everyone else has basically told me I have to options, reject my return offer and risk it in the hopes that they reply to me, or take the return offer and then ""ditch it"" if someone much better comes along. I am very hesitant to do either one of these things for obvious reasons.


If it helps here are some companies and when I applied:

Google SWE Intern - Mid August

Linkedin SWE Intern - Mid August

Google Engineering Practicum - Early October

Microsoft - several applications ranging from early to late September (including Microsoft explore)

SWE intern at Medium Biotech Startup in Mtn View - mid to late September (jobvite says ""In Progress"" for it, but no response yet - would probably want to work here more than anywhere else)

Nest SWE/Embedded SWE intern - late august (Jobvite says ""new"")

SpaceX SWE intern - Early September (Jobvite says ""new"")


I have also been interviewing with 4 other companies at the moment, but I won't receive any offers from them until mid to late November most likely (when it will be too late and they pay $10/hr less than the place I hated).

3o5jc1,14,2015-10-09,Having Trouble Finding an Entry-Level Job,peachdream91,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3o5jc1/having_trouble_finding_an_entrylevel_job/,"Hi.

I've been reading a lot of question/answers that pertain to my above question, and yet I still seem to struggle so maybe I need more personalized advice from the helpful Reddit community. This is half a career question, half life question.

I graduated college last May and ever since then it has been truly an uphill climb to secure fulltime work. I'm a 24-year-old minority female, and have a Bachelor's from a good school in History, French and Journalism which I used to break into the Public Relations industry (an industry that I'm not particularly passionate about, but I seem to do okay there). I did well in school, keeping my GPA around 3.8.

I have studied abroad, lived and worked abroad twice. I have seven internships in my field at top agencies/companies. I actually just got done with an internship at the #2 PR agency/office in the world. I've taken courses at several different universities, including schools like Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon and Emory. I'm well educated and experienced. I can secure placements, plan campaigns and handle social media. 

At first I was applying through portals, but I recently gave that up and decided to never put my info in a portal ever again. Now I send a hard copy of a personalized cover letter, resume and work samples to every hiring manager who posts a position I'm interested in. I plan to follow up with an e-mail and phone  call to those people in a week. This is my current job search process. Since February 2014, I have applied to at least 200 positions. Since May 2014, I have had four more internships and 1 temporary job as a Production Assistant. 

This problem is really and truly the bane of my existence. I'm so tired of interning and want nothing more in life than to be financially independent and a productive member of society. I think about it and work towards it everyday but see so little return on investment. I see less experienced people get hired so easily and it drives me nuts. Sometimes I wonder if my race and gender are involved in me getting passed over.

I had two interviews set up and I blew them both, to my surprise. I am still kicking myself in the face over it and will be until the end of the year. From that I realized my flaws, attention to detail and underpreparation are definitely two of them.

I'd much rather start my own business(es) but I don't know how and have no money, barely any network, no insider knowledge and to be honest, I need to pay my bills! I think I want to be in a completely different industry, but even more than that I want to move out of my parent's house. I don't know if I have time or intellectual energy to switch careers. So, my question is, has anyone been in the same position and what did you do to pull yourself out and what could I be doing differently? It feel like i've tried everything. What do I do now? "

I'm graduating from undergrad next spring. Right now I'm in an IT internship at an investment bank, mostly writing tests but I'm also writing a cloud app and learning how to do UI stuff with gwt and a little bit of database stuff. I took this internship because I wanted to solidify my technical CS skills because I feel like I haven't had as in depth of a cs experience as people who are only doing a CS degree (I started as linguistics and stayed in that department when I added CS so I missed out on a lot of the resources in the CS department).

However, while I love the problem solving of programming and the abstract stuff of figuring out how to solve a problem etc, this internship has me wondering if I really want to spend the rest of my life sitting in front of a computer writing code. I like coding, but doing it for 8 hours every day is not super fun.

I like programming, I like making spreadsheets and powerpoints and explaining things to people. I love linguistics and natural language processing is pretty much the most interesting thing in the world to me. So my question is: what kind of careers can I pursue that allow me to be involved in things like that but where I'm maybe not the one writing the code 100% of the time?

I'm also thinking about grad school (probably for NLP), although I would probably need to take some time to make enough money for that. So advice about grad school, or career trajectories/where to start out would also be appreciated."

3o60ns,6,2015-10-09,"Had a fantastic mentorship experience, but I still feel like I'm going to let down my team. Anyone have experience on either side of this situation?",fooobarbazz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3o60ns/had_a_fantastic_mentorship_experience_but_i_still/,"Apologies in advance for the anxiety ridden post, kinda awkward putting this out there.
  
Background:
While interning this past summer, I was so incredibly lucky to be put on the team I was assigned. My manager did daily one-on-ones, pulled me aside to involve me in other projects, always made me feel extremely welcomed and valuable (is this normal?) even though I felt I was just scraping by the whole time. Maybe he realized how self-conscious I was, I'm not sure. It was a full stack internship and there was a lot to learn on my end especially on the front end (I had never worked with JS (and associated libraries for the project like backbone, D3, etc.), PHP, and few other technologies that were required. I ended up building what they wanted (albeit terribly in my opinion) and they even extended me an incredible FT offer.

I feel so indebted to this person (and the team) who helped make becoming a developer more of a reality than I ever thought was possible. My concern is that I wont be able to maintain the degree of success necessary to become valuable when starting as a new grad. This mentorship wont be around forever and I certainly don't want to be dependent on it. Being self-conscious is something I'm trying to work on, but it's difficult. I try to keep outward projections of my  (possibly senseless) anxiety to a minimum.
  
A few questions:
Am I justified to feel self conscious about productivity at this stage? I understand the bar isn't /that/ high for new grads, but I still want to be reasonably valuable.

Any developers out there willing to impart advice, experiences, and/or suggestions on managing anxiety? Has anyone successfully mentored someone who was sort of internally conflicted?"

This year I started an internship with a broadcast company, and one of my big resume and interview points was my programming ability. Anyone who understands the words ""Software Development"" already knows where this tale leads. My first couple of weeks were largely uneventful - learning how the different servers work and what part of the encoding process they do, getting up-to-speed with exchange and getting flustered trying to figure out how to migrate our 2008 system to 2012, the usual - and acted mostly as an introduction to the fellows I would be working with, and a bit of an evaluation of my technical literacy. About a month in, I got the request.  

""I've got a little task for you guys"", my boss' boss said to my fellow intern and I, ""Just a simple web GUI to control some input switching on an encoding server.""  
Because providing access to the server itself would open up far more than just input switching (deleting an entire output, for example), they wanted a simple web GUI that would simply allow an operator to select an output and choose its new input. Sounds simple enough.  

Once I said yes, the client provided the specification.  

I started this internship about 7 months ago, and I'm still working on some of the features. The live version has single-input-multiple-output context-sensitive switching that won't allow an invalid input to be routed to the wrong output, user accounts with region-based access rights, which ties into outputs being tied to certain regions so a random chump in one state can't accidentally change the input of something on the other side of the country, and of course every action is logged by the system.  
The improved version that hasn't been deployed yet also has a scheduling system, which also allows changes or removals of schedules when they're in the system, and naturally merges new uploads with any existing scheduled switches. Of course this wasn't in the original spec, except for a line about ""interfacing with their scheduling system"".  

I'm not really upset about all of this, because I love programming and the experience I've got has been invaluable. The whole time I've been here it's been nothing but a dream, because the workplace itself is great. But I have to say, the clients certainly like their scope creep."

I have 2 years of software development experience (one as an intern, 1 as a full time employee).  I also have 1 year of experience doing general IT work (IT procurement, IT asset management, end user support, technical documentation, etc).

I have worked on/around various servers (OS servers, mail servers, web servers, app servers, BES/mobile servers, etc).  I have an intimate knowledge of desktop OSes (Windows, linux, etc).  I know a lot of the ""odds and ends""  stuff (VPN/Citrix, SCCM, knowledge of hardware, various OBIEE products, thin clients, I know a fair bit about networking, scripting (python, powershell), etc).

I probably don't have the knowledge of a seasoned sysadmin, but I may have the knowledge of a entry level sysadmin.  I am 26 years old, currently making 65k in a low COL area.  No certs.

How hard would it be to transfer out of software dev and into some other IT area?  What do you think the pay would be like?  What type of roles should I look at?

Edit: Also, I am interested in security but don't know where to start.  I have a fair amount of experience doing offensive pen testing on web apps, but mostly just for fun/in my spare time.  I have strong SQL skills too (T-SQL and PL/SQL as well), but no nearly enough knowledge for a DBA role."

I realized that some programs are listed as VLSI and some as Advanced computer systems.  I understand VLSI is everything from architecture to pre/post fab verification, whereas advanced computer systems cover things like logic design, embedded systems and computer architecture as well.  I enjoy the hardware side of computer engineering where I can learn to create a processor from scratch or even using VHDL. I want to do computer architecture for a living so I'm trying to figure out which one is more towards what I want to do and what schools are good for it.  Just in case this helps, I have a 3.4 GPA, taking GRE at end of month, have already taken a graduate course in systems design(and plan to take another course next semester), and have had internship experiences although it wasn't hardware engineering.

I have 1 year of full time work experience, and 6 months of internship experience that I did during my university days (3 months of which was at one of the big 4 tech companies). I am actually happy with my employer but I don't feel like I fit really well with the people of South Africa in general.
I got my MSc in Computer Science at a top (South) African University (University of Cape Town). I would very much like to relocate over to Germany. I have a lot of German friends and have traveled over Germany/EU a few times already. Really like Berlin/Hamburg/Cologne (have not been to Frankfurt or Munich to be honest). I am also willing and happy to learn German.
I am just wondering what my chances are? I do have student debt which is kind of holding me back but I have nice parents who would be willing to help me out if required. I have given much thought to this and I think it's time for me to go. I am patient, I am willing to do what it takes to achieve this.
Any chance of me finding work all the way here on online job portals? anyone have success with this?I have been told if I get a job offer and they willing to assist with my visa application then thats pretty much the best/easiest route?"

3oay7x,8,2015-10-11,Why am I crap at making friends?,LostAndFriendless,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3oay7x/why_am_i_crap_at_making_friends/,"Hey guys,

    I am writing to you guys on this Saturday night, sitting in my room in the dark all by myself. This has been my life story for the the better part of this year. I am currently 26, 
about to be 27 in a few weeks, and I can honestly say that at this point in my life I have 0 friends. When my birthday comes, I will probably only get birthday wishes from a
few family members and thats it. 250+ facebook friends and nothing. Its not like I've tried, I met plenty of people in college but I never really bonded with any of them the way
I imagine friends would. I was never anyones 1st point of contact. I usually found out about events through a mutual friend and would attend on the regular. But the moment 
I graduated college, we all went our separate ways, and have recieved no contact from anyone, with a few exceptions which I'll explain later. That was 5 years ago btw. 
     Its not like I have a shitty life, on the contrary, I have a decent gig as a software eng making close to six figures. But, making friends has never been my forte sadly. I almost
feel like I'm a ghost, that only gets noticed when convenienced.To make matters worse, I'm only just realizing this. I currently live in an apartment with 3 other roomates. These are the
exceptions I mentioned earlier. When we first moved in it was all fun and games. But as time has gone one, they've made new friends. With that came no more invites. One of them, whom I've known since
elementary school and whom I'm the closest with only invites me to stuff as hes headed out the door by passing. At this point I feel his invites are more like courtesy. Its rare when 
we do things together. If we do, they'll usually invite their new friends and as the event progresses, I'll come to the realization that I am sitting by myself in the corner while they've 
basically separated with their new friends. At this point I'll just go to my room and try and figure something. Stuff like this in the past didn't really get to me, I just figured 
they wanted to talk to their friends, but recently, it's been hitting me like a ton of bricks. I feel like I'm just being pushed aside and forgotten. 
     Sadly, my social situation at work is the same. When I first started I went out of my way to bond with co-workers, who were older, I was an intern when I started, and everything was good. It sort
of sheltered me from the deteriorating situation at home at first. But as time has gone on, I feel forgotten at work too. When lunch time comes around, or parties, I feel left out. By the time I look up
from my desk for people to eat with, they're all gone. So I end up walking home, I live across the street, and cooking lunch and watch T.V.  
     Its getting to the point where I think I am developing social anxiety. When my friends have their friends over, I don't want to come out of my room out of the fear that I'll get judged for being awkward.
I really don't know how to proceed from here. I feel like I have wasted my life up until this point. I am about to be 27, 3 years from being 30, and I have nothing to really brag about in terms of experiences.
I'm starting to feel really self conscious about my whole situation. Even as I write this I can't help but feel like a looser, that I have no friends that I can bring this up with and discuss this.
          So my question to you is this: Wtf is wrong with me? Why am I so bad at making friends? I never imagined that at 27 I would have zero friends. I realize you guys arent professionals but some advice would be much 
appreciated. PS. I apologize for my writing, Im pretty crap at it...   "

They know that I'm studying for my CCNA, and that I'm new to the field. I was primarily hired for my experience in customer service, since this particular job is in between the two aspects (IT  &amp; CS). Despite being promoted from intern to full time quickly, problems are now starting to arise in my current situation. Because I am not certified, I work(ed) the graveyard shift, with other people with no CCNA. Meaning none of my shift supervisors are knowledgeable enough to work mornings, but have worked there long enough to know how to do their job to earn their position.

However, they aren't good teachers, and any time anything major happened they would take care of it themselves. They would never explain anything, and if I asked for help they would take me to the solution without teaching me how to solve the problem. If I asked 'why' they dismissed it as silly questions. There were even multiple things they told me I couldn't do until I got my CCNA, despite them not having their CCNA themselves. And now, fast forward two months, there are no shift leaders on my shift, just me and a guy that's newer than me (but more experienced in internal workings - he was transferred from another department in the same company), and because I have questions and make mistakes my manager treats me like I'm too slow in the head to function... And what is incredibly frustrating is that I know more than my co-worker, but he and my boss hit it off well because they always talk about sports and superheros, two things I'm wildly uninterested in.

I was given a write up for not doing one of the things a shift manager told me I wouldn't be doing until I got my CCNA. They asked me why I didn't do it, I told them I was told explicitly not to, and they said they would talk to the shift leaders, but I was still written up and told that 'I didn't know how' wasn't a good enough excuse. I get talked down to when I ask questions, and get scolded at if I don't know how to do something. I got yelled at for not asking how to handle a situation before I ever saw said situation happen. I don't know how I'm supposed to ask a question about something I don't know exists before I see it.

And now, the final straw has been plucked, when my co-worker became shift supervisor. Over a two man shift - me and him. Basically, a giant middle finger to me. That means that I work the tickets, do the security rounds, call customers, both of which was work that we split, and he makes sure I don't mess up and gets paid more to do it. Tonight he called a customer and I had to explain to him what to say while the customer was on hold because my former co-worker, now shift leader didn't understand the situation.

I'm nearly 80% done with ICND1 and am quickly approaching the test. I'm far ahead of my co-workers on the graveyard shift in terms IT knowledge, which is NOT saying much. That's not the problem. The problem is all the secretarial ins and outs of this job. We have three different sites that provide us with customer information, client data, and on call phone numbers. You're supposed to know exactly which website to go to for what situation, because a lot of the information on the other two sites for that particular aspect is wildly outdated. Why they don't just consolidate three sickeningly under-performing sites into one bearable one is beyond me, but that's the way it is.

So instead of being patient with me and answering my questions, my manager will say something to the affect of 'I could have sworn we had a similar situation last week. Last week I told you to go here. Are we having a problem with communication?', EVERY time I have a question. Where as when my co-worker asks a question, he gets a patient and decent response. I honestly learn more from over-hearing their conversations than anything else.

I overheard my boss talking to my now shift leader about how I couldn't be trusted to be on shift alone, so my shift leader would have to wait to take his mandatory one hour break until after my boss got to work. That's also the excuse for why I have to do all the work, because he has to be available if something 'crazy happens'.

I consider myself a decently smart guy. I wouldn't say I'm a genius, nor would I say I'm overtly intelligent, but... Smart enough for a job like this? Easily. But because of a completely lack of training since I was hired on I have no basis to prove otherwise to my boss. And It's frustrating me... And worse, stressing me out. I feel sick to my stomach constantly when I think about work, on the days that I work I do nothing but stay in bed and stress about the day(aka night) to come, I even get so full of self-pity I want to just cry, quickly replaced by a reaffirmation of 'No, it's not your fault', which turns into seething anger...

I'm unhappy with my situation and I just want to get past this point in my career. I think this company is great. I don't want to stop working for them, especially when they were the first to give me a shot... But I don't know how to handle this any longer, and I don't have anyone to reach out to for help, so I simply ask you... Any advice or wisdom you have, please... Help me. Let me know what you would do, and what you would not do.

3ock9j,0,2015-10-11,Where do I even begin?,Entr0pic08,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ock9j/where_do_i_even_begin/,"A bit of background:

I'm currently employed as a field/telephone interviewer and I've had this temporary employment for the past few years. I joined my current company in early 2013, so far, so good. I had a very good prospect offer that could probably have really solidified me within the company at the time (got a temporary full-time offer during the summer, was elected the best performer during a process evaluation by those that employ us) and I accepted, obviously. However, I had to retract the offer early due to health issues that began to onset as soon as I began to work on this new prospect and from there I guess I just lost work ethics because I stopped moving, pretty much. Since it's a low pay first step job, there is almost no ability to move within the company, especially since I fluked the one opportunity I had and had to go on extended sick leave and later came back almost a year after. I have a masters degree in global studies and a bachelor's in social anthropology. I love anthropology, global studies not so much. I'd like to work with anthropology but as you can understand, it's a difficult subject to get employed in. 

I had almost no guiding or counseling during my early years both during and after graduation. I had a temporary job as an interviewer in high school which has helped me in securing these other interview jobs but I'm stuck in the telemarketing business. I don't get out of here. I apply for other, similar jobs, but I lack experience that makes me overlooked. I can get sales jobs no problem almost immediately it's disgusting, but I cannot get other low income but more secure jobs, even stuff like customer service. 

I struggle a lot with motivation, which is part because I've had a very tough life since very early on and has spent most of my life being more or less depressed (I self-diagnosed myself with dysthymia for most of my life and clinical depression during my teenage years). 

I regret a lot of the poor life choices I've made which is part because of poor guidance from my environment (I had none, I had to figure out how to be an adult by my own, pretty much, and I never got any real support by my family or environment) and a lot of what I did was more like taking whatever came my way and see what I could do with it, but I can't go back and change them. What I can do is to make sure I can make up for them somehow but I just don't know how. I do apply for quite a few jobs and I try some different venues to broaden my experience like internships and idk what else, and most of all, I don't care if it's low pay, but I'd like a full-time, stable job with stable work hours. I can apply for other better jobs later on. Right now I just want a job I feel is a) somewhat satisfying intellectually speaking, and b) gives me enough pay so I can plan my future with my girlfriend and not having to worry about my money. (No, I never managed to land those internship positions *either* fml. 

I feel like this work uncertain hours every week is slowly killing me, actually. It's killing my motivation and it's killing my energy and because I've always felt my energy and motivation has been an all-time low, I feel like I am not entirely sure how I'm going to challenge myself and find the spark I need to really make the change I feel I need to do with my life and the clock is ticking and my girlfriend is very worried about the situation and feels insecure about the future of our relationship and it matters more than anything to me, and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel the best when I have some stable routine in my life and I do know what to come the month ahead. 

Like, help? How do you fucking create motivation when you've never had a proper employment and you want to land that job. How do I work on my way from here and how do I land other jobs in other fields so I get somewhere else in life? 

I had to complement my studies so I'm waiting to get the results so I can actually get my masters diploma. I've considered pursuing a PhD since global studies nor anthropology are fields you can easily get hired in on the current market. I'd like to work with some kind of qualitative studies in the future, since that is what I am educated in. I'd like to work with maybe LGBT rights or the like. My theses both focused on gender, one degree or another. I am well-educated in transgender issues. I think I could work within that kind of field no problem, and provide a lot to the field. I don't have qualitative work experience because I never managed to find a proper internship during the time I should have had during my masters but really, it's not overly complicated. I know how to make qualitative studies and how to analyze them. I regret that too, though, lack of internship experience. It had helped a lot. I regret I didn't take up a secondary job position somewhere, I regret I felt too lazy to move from my city to pursue other prospects. 

Fuck. Help me. Something."

I know my data structures and can code. I'm a Junior and have a confirmed shot at a cushy 80k job out of an east coast company outside of Boston, but am not sure if I should take it. The pay does not increase for a LONG while, so I would have to have that salary for a good amount of time.


It has a very good work life balance, but some people have told me people go to this company to retire because of how laid back it is.


My logic in this situation is to go for it because of the minimal stress it would be providing me, giving me a chance to work on side projects with more passion.

I'm currently taking a programming languages course at my college, where I will build a RISC interpreter for the Forth language. In addition to my existing skillset, I still have a good amount of time before I start work-- which I'd gladly spend gaining experience with the stack that your company works with.

And if im being honest with myself, I regret getting that degree. I mean, i loved learning about the material and loved all of my classes, but like a lot of people out there, I guess i just didnt know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life as an 18-19 year old and didnt think about how i would apply my degree in the real world. I did a senior thesis research project and now work as an RA in a psychoacoustic lab and have realized I just dont want to do neuro related research for the rest of my life.

A little more info regarding my situation. I was on a full ride academic scholarship and only have like 5k in student loans (just due to living in the dorms) but im also not making shit at my current job and dont have a ton of money in savings- me and fiance have a one year old son and are also trying to pay for a decent chunk of our wedding in april. we are fortunate enough to live with my parents for the moment so we dont have to worry about bills or anything like that, but my fiance is still in school until May to finish up her undergrad in business, so we are not rich by any means! and taking out student loans for another degree terrify me! But it just might be worth it to make a career change.

I have always excelled in math (took math through calc II and did fine) and have been exposed to programming to some degree- I took an undergrad course in bioinformatics and ive actually been working my way through the online book/guide 'learning python the hard way' (am about half way done). I also do some light programming fairly often at my current job as an RA. Its mainly just tweaking scripts in MATLAB, so obviously not anything very intensive.

Here are my questions. I have done some reading and have seen that CS students commonly do internships over the summer and sometimes these places of work will pay for school. How common of a occurrence is this? Also, my local university has both a major and minor in CS. How much would just a minor a benefit me in terms of switching careers at this point? Or should I just go for the full major? I live in the midwest and in state tuition is only $200 per credit hour at my local university. And seeing as I already have all of my humanities and whatnot, I could definitely finish the degree in 6 semesters max (that is if i went full time, im not sure how possible that would be with my current living situation/finances and balancing trying to provide for my family, we would really like to get our own place sometime within the next year).

Help me out reddit! I'm sick of being broke, want a change, but am very nervous about taking out loans to get a second degree given my current family/financial situation. Give me some advice!"

My desktop PC recently started freezing all the time. It happens on regular startups aswell as when running in safemode. The computer will startup fine, but as soon as I press for example the start menu the screen will freeze (I can still move the mouse).

I'm thinking it's a memory issue (either rams or my ssd).

The computer is a ~3 years old Windows PC. These are the specs:

Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro Rev.2 - 92m

Kingston HyperX - 2x4GB DDR3 1600MHz PC3

Gigabyte GA-Z68AP-D3 - ATX LGA1155

Gigabyte GV R795WF3-3GD - HD7950 3GB

Kingston V300 120GB SSD

If there's anything I can do to troubleshoot, or any information I haven't provided please let me know. I am generally better at gaming on my pc than fixing it, so I apologize if my question is stupid or obvious.

///////


**Update 1**

I've now tried starting the computer with the ram sticks one of the time and I still get the same hang. I also checked the CPU temperature in the bios and it was 28 degrees and my fans are running (~1000rpm according to bios, don't know if that is sufficient?).

I don't have anything on my ssd that I'm worried about losing, so I'm going to attempt to format the drive and reinstall Windows and drivers tomorrow to eliminate software as an issue. I'm guessing that if the ssd is toast, I'm going to be unable to format it and reinstall Windows(?).

///////

**Update 2**

Via some googling I found a person with a somewhat similar problem and a suggestion that said to run Windows in safe mode with command prompt and then type in ""sfc /scannow"" to let the computer find and repair damaged file. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so, as I get a hang as soon as I type anything in the cmd, but I was able to get a [blue screen which I took a picture of.](http://i.imgur.com/Vh7kzKj.png)"

First off I'm in my third semester out of a 3 semester remedial math course because I didn't score high enough on the placement. I was doing alright but then I took the same test 4 times and got a 75% every time where you need an 80% to pass. Now I can't take it again until wednesday and I will be a week behind. I was trying to get a week ahead because I'm kind of slow at math. It's just a real downer when you think you know the material only to take an 8 problem test and still technically pass but except you don't. Next is my Java class. I don't get it at all, like math I can at least work out and eventually be alright at, but I have never not understood something this much in my life. I have tried talking to my friends who code, using online resources, and codeacademy but I just don't get it at all. I'm starting to get some of the chapter one and two stuff but we are already moving onto chapter 4. Same goes for my accounting class. I was doing alright but we are moving so fast I feel like I can't keep up. I think Java might be the teacher I have asked her questions but she can never really answer them, or I'm just making excuses. My only class that's going ok is ancient lit surprisingly. 

Then I have to transfer to another college next year and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it. I am trying to buy a car so I can commute (and I need it for work) but that still leaves me with 30k I don't have. I don't get anything from the FAFSA and my parents can't help me with it. I can't work anymore than 20 hours at my job because then I wouldn't have time for homework. 

I really want to get my degree in IT, I have already done an internship and loved it. But I just don't know if I can do it. I will feel like a failure if I can't, I already kind of do. Neither of my parents went to college and I was going to join the police force like my dad but even that you need a college education for and probably military background (something I can't put my parents through, I'm an only child). After that I was going to go to UTI to be a mechanic (love working and fixing things) but turns out that school is a for profit and I don't see a career ladder I can climb in a mechanic career like I can with IT

I just don't know what to do. Should I take a break? I doubt that will make a difference. Should I take less classes? 4 seems like a lot but then I would need to be in school for more time which is more money I don't have. Should I drop programming to free more time for the other classes I know I can pass? 

Not trying to give a pity story here, I'm just trying to lay out the facts in hopes of getting good advice

EDIT: Reading through this post a few times as well as doing some thinking, I am leaning towards dropping the Java class and retaking it another semester. This would free up time to stress less about that class and do other work as well as give me a reason to stay an extra semester and save more money. Thoughts?"

I wanted to ask your advice regarding my situation. I'm a EE in the first semester of my senior year and have to make some really tough decisions here soon. I've got two primary options:

Option one: graduate school in computer engineering, focusing on embedded systems and bio-sensors. I've basically been guaranteed funding by professors at my school, and find the area very interesting. 

Option two: I've just been offered a internship (that will turn into a job offer) with Texas Instruments in digital verification. I've never worked in this area before, but realize that it's a very good opportunity. I also think it sounds interesting. 

Last important piece of information: I'm really burned out with school. I get really stressed during the semester, and my overall quality of life drops dramatically. When working full time I literally have twice the energy and actually enjoy life. I really dislike school, although I've been able to maintain a good GPA. 

Now, I realize the these areas are very different, but I don't really have a strong preference. I'd much rather just start working, but I don't want to handicap my future self by not getting a graduate degree (especially when it's paid for). I also realize that the opportunity with TI is a good one, and don't want to graduate with a MS only to find that I can't find a better job (especially since grad school will be in an entirely different area). 

I realize of course that the decision ultimately depends on me, but any advice on how I can process this? I want to make the best decision I can. Either way, it seems like I'm passing up a good opportunity. "

It's been a bit of a struggle since I didn't have internships in college. Next week I have an interview for an IT position at a company that I would love to work for, but the position requires/desires technologies that I have no experience with, like ASP, .net, C#, VB6. Most of my intensive programming experience was done in Java. I'm also fairly proficient with SQL, but have never worked with SQL server (a skill they ""prefer""). Additionally, I have experience with basic, conceptual networking protocols and building smaller client/server applications in Java, but I've never worked with windows server (a skill they ""require""). You get the gist here.

For now, I've downloaded VS Code and I've started looking at various introductory videos on Pluralsight to using VS, ASP.net, etc, so I at least have something to talk about when these questions come up in the interview. Furthermore, while I have no experience with C#, I have a pretty strong grasp of OOP, which is something they mention in their job description (I actually passed an OOP technical interview earlier in my job search, and was offered a job, but I had to turn it down for various reasons).

Beyond this, I'm a little unsure how to prepare for this interview. I'm confident that given time and training, I'll be able to pick up these skills. There's also little chance that I'll need to program anything extensively from scratch; from what I can gather from the job description most of my day-to-day responsibility will require using, monitoring, and updating existing applications, and there will be a senior programmer directly above me and an applications director above him. I would call this position entry-level/junior, although it wasn't technically advertised as such (the pay essentially dictates this, regardless of their desired candidate).

How do I talk about technologies I am unfamiliar with? How do I convince the hiring team that I am capable of picking up the skills that they are looking for without sounding like I am completely rambling and spitballing?

I'm a little worried that I just got an interview to flesh out their numbers or something like that, but another part of me feels like they may be interested in hiring me regardless of my experience. I mean, they saw my resume, so they must know that I don't exactly line up with the ideal candidate, and are willing to help train me. Help?"

After spending a few years in the industry being an intern (handling digital media) I was looking to finally start my career but was unable to break in. With loans needing to be paid I gave in and took a job in a unrelated field (customer service/data entry) due to good pay and benefits. I took those skills and recently started a new job in more sales support oriented role (2 months ago) and already I am starting to reflect on where I am and where I want to be. After having a long discussion with multiple friends and family members I am quickly realizing that the career choices I made do not reflect what I want to actually be doing. 

I have a great passion for technology. It has taken a long time but I've finally decided that an IT related field is where I need to put myself. I know that being a programmer is not an area I see myself in. Seeing as I have little experience in any sort of IT field other than the amount of tinkering I do in my own time, my questions are:
 
-How do I go about making this transition? Where do I start and what kind of basics/certifications should I be trying to learn/obtain before even sending out my resume? 

-Would a help desk job be the best place to transition to (considering my customer service/communications background)? What kind of career path am I looking at with no degree?"
3ojcyo,5,2015-10-12,Bad internship experience impacting grad school applications?,Kellab,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3ojcyo/bad_internship_experience_impacting_grad_school/,"I have gotten myself into a little bit of a situation...
    
To get the first details out of the way: I have my BSc (Hons) in biology and I am looking to get into a masters by research program in a particular lab. It is an ecology lab, so the field work is fairly intensive. The professor is also very well known in his field, so I am assuming I am going to have to REALLY stand out to be considered. 

I have a lot of research experience. I worked for a lot of professors in undergrad at a field station, helped teach field courses, and volunteered on a lot of projects. I did not jump right in to grad school after graduating because I really wanted to make sure I was giving myself the opportunity to try to get involved in something I was passionate about. I knew what I thought I wanted to study, but I wanted to get experience in the field just to make sure it was for me...and then move on to grad school.

I ended up getting a really amazing internship opportunity after graduating and I jumped right into it. It was my DREAM and I knew that I wanted to do my masters in that field. Everything was going amazingly, I had all sorts of awesome references lined up...and then there was a field accident. The field work I was doing had an inherent risk to it, but I was dealing with EXTREME  and unpredictable circumstances, solo, on a daily basis (conditions I would not be dealing with for my potential masters). Eventually the inevitable happened and I ended up getting in a really bad situation, inches from dying more than once, and my supervisors DID NOT CARE. I was mocked for the traumatic event, instead of consoled, and told it was my fault (it was not). Looking back now, it was almost certainly ""intern abuse"", but I wanted to work in that field SO BAD and I was alone, in a foreign country...so I kept going. After the accident I kept working for 3 or 4 months, but it ended up taking quite a toll on me mentally. 

I finished the research season, was very good at the field work, and presented the findings of my research to the public at the end of the project. The supervisors asked me to finish writing up an annual report to summarize the season some time in the following year, and I agreed. BUT--- when I went home, the full extent of what I went through hit me, and I could not even look at the report. I told them as much, but as I should have expected...they did not care and I have essentially lost those references. I tried SO HARD to get that report done, but it was not possible, and now it is more than too late. I have done a thesis before, and can and have completed many reports, but this report still haunts me. 

It has been 2 years since my internship and I have been recovering in that time. I have gotten back to a point where I am ready to get back into the field again but I am terrified that my terrible internship experience will tarnish my applications to grad school. Because the lab is so competitive, I am guessing that my intern research experience in the field will be very important to highlight in my application, but I do NOT want to use them as a reference. 

I know that academic references are usually much more important than professional ones when it comes to grad school, but with my internship being directly applicable to the masters I want to do...is this still true? Would it be generally acceptable to talk about my internship, but give references from my undergrad  thesis and work instead? Should I just pretend my internship never happened? I am very worried that I will get talking to a professor, and they will want a reference from my internship and then my chances will be ruined. 
Is there a way to handle a bad reference? I had volunteers that helped occasionally with my project, could they be a reference? I suppose if asked, I could get into the ~whole story~ but that feels like it would scare a professor away more than anything.

Sorry for how long this got! I would really appreciate any guidance or advice on how I should approach applying! Thanks for your time!!

February 16 2020

I glanced down at my phone and then back at the door to the restaurant. 

I knew this was a bad idea. It had been a stressful week, the latest batch of samples in the lab had been contaminated by some idiotic intern so an entire week of research had to be thrown down the drain my car had a brand new scratch down the side of it from where some idiot had sideswiped me, and to top it off my phone had a new crack in the glass. 

I had signed up for the dating site after I had broken up with Courtney months ago. Not that I had really expected much from it. Most responses I had gotten were poorly constructed if legible and quite a few of the women I was matched too had given off serious crazy vibes even in their pictures. 

The only normal one had been a small lithe looking woman, with black hair and an angular face. A more classical type of beauty and not the overdone and artificial looks that seemed to be the preference at the moment. So despite the sucky week had asked her out through the chat program, thinking I might have one good thing.  

We had agreed to meet here, and she was ten minutes late. So the week was still not looking like it was going to improve. 

Getting ready to leave I started to stand. 

âJon?â asked a voice. 

I looked up and my heart froze. The woman standing in front of me, wrapped in a thick black jacket was stunningly beautiful, the picture of her on the profile was an injustice to her actual features. 

For a moment I gaped like a proper idiot at her. 

âYes,â I managed to choke out. 

She smoothly sat down in the chair across from me, âIâm Rogue.â 

She held her hand out to me, I quickly moved to shaker hers and promptly knocked over the large glass of water in front of me spilling it on the table. 

âAh sorry!â Quickly I threw my napkin onto the puddle and I felt myself blushing furiously. Two minutes into the first date since I had dumped Courtney and here I was acting like a complete bumbling idiot, in front of what had to be the most attractive woman I had ever met in my life. 

She laughed, and immediately I felt my ears burn. 

âIts fine!â she quickly shrugged off her jacket and put her hand on mine, âItâs nice to meet you.â 

The fact that her hand was on mine and that underneath her coat she was wearing a very tight black dress short circuited my brain. 

The foreign accent wherever it was from didnât help much either, it was sexy as hell. Very inappropriate images began to run through my mind with wild abandon, not at all restrained by the part of my brain that would usually try to reign such fantasies in.  

âNice to meet you too!â

She nodded and looked down at the mess on the table, and took a deep breath. I quickly noticed that she was a little flushed, and her hair around her ears was sticking up slightly. Perhaps she was as frazzled as I was. 

âSo uh,â I paused, âWhere you from?â I asked. 

âFar away. I just moved here.â 

âAh, well what do you think?â 

She frowned, âItâs nicer than where I came from. Lots of people.â 

âThat a good thing?â 

âIt is.â 

Both of us fell silent, and a waiter finally getting to our table took the napkins and replaced the waters. 

Rogue squirmed in her seat slightly like she was uncomfortable. I was hesitant to say anything, the rather inappropriate images gallivanting around the inside of my skull were only increasing in their complexity. I hadnât felt like this since I had been a horny teenager who had just found internet porn. 

âYou want to get out of here?â asked Rogue. 

âWhat?â 

âIâm in a hotel right now while I sort some things out. You want to come back with me?â she asked. 

I blinked, in the back of my mind a part of me was saying something was very wrong here. But looking into the womanâs eyes that small voice was quickly silenced. Her eyes held a great sadness inside of them, she was trying to hide it behind a smile but I could see it. 

That sadness put everything else in her soul to bear in front of me. She was alone, desperately alone and afraid. She would never admit it, there was too much strength in her eyes and she could survive if she needed too. The simple fact was that she didnât want to, like everyone else in the world she wanted someone she could be weak with. Someone with whom no barriers were needed, no masks put in place.   

I had always been something of a coward when it came to love, and women in general. My last experience with Courtney and her trust issues were evidence enough of that. Seeing the strength in her eyes spurred me on, giving me a righteous kick in the ass to not let whatever this woman was in front of me drift away and out of my life. 

For once in my life I said fuck it to the consequences and I took the risk. 

âSure.â 

I stood up and the two of us walked out of the restaurant, and into a future that neither of us expected, but which we would embrace together.

&lt;Forever Forward&gt; 

March 3 2021

Looking out at the night sky I stared up at the moon, ever since Rogueâs entrance into my life Iâd had more appreciation for it. It was the closest celestial neighbor to Earth, and the only one we had visited so far so it held a certain charm. It represented what we could do and what we were destined to do. It was the gateway to the stars and the people living out among them.

Rogueâs ears perked up and she quickly straightened, 

âWhat?â I asked recognizing the signs of alarm. 

She bolted from my lap without a word out into the back yard. I doubted the squirrels were making a return considering how many she had caught, so I quickly followed her. 

In the moonlight I had to keep my eyes focused on Rogueâs clothes, since her skin was phasing in and out of her camo. She favored darker toned clothes so it still wasnât easy but I was by this point pick her out in the darkness. 

âHello!â said Rogue to something at her feet, in a tone I had never heard her use in the entire time we had been together.  

She was speaking to something at her feet, and stooping down she quickly collected whatever it was. 

Darting back toward me I blinked I stared at the small ball of fur in her hands, a little jet black kitten that couldnât be more than five weeks old by the looks of it. Just old enough to have been weened. The little thing looked healthy enough but it was plainly not happy with its current predicament, telling us so with its little disgruntled growls. 

âI found a kitten!â she held the small thing out to me, the kitten let out another pitiful meow. 

âYes you did, weâre not keeping it.â 

âYes we are! Sheâs named Nakja!â 

I took me a moment to mentally switch gears and translate, âDarkness? Might be in your language but itâs still not a very original name, weâre not keeping a kitten!â 

âYes we are!â Said Rogue as she raised the small ball of fur and chaos to her cheek, the small thing had seemingly figured out that the alien was its best bet for affection and rubbed up against her purring. Rogueâs own purrs quickly joined in. 

âNo.â 

âYes!â 

âWe keep it for the night! Then we make sure it has a good home, we are not keeping it!â I said.

Both Rogue and the small kitten gave me a look that told me I was completely wrong.

May 26 2021

I woke to the contented purring of the two creatures that were effectively running my life. Rogue was from what I could tell hugging most of my lower body, her head resting on my stomach. Nakja was on my chest curled up into a ball of fur which I knew could in mere moments spout claws and attack me if I moved. 

Slowly as to not to disturb either of the vicious creatures I picked up Rogueâs tablet and dutifully continued to read through everything. I was getting better with her language, and we were trying to speak it exclusively at home. Anthropological data and cultural analysis were not light reading even in English though so it was still slow going. 

I had pieced most of what I would need together and at this point I was just trying to figure how to do everything. Some things would be impossible, the correct meal afterwards for example, but she would understand. 

As I continued to read the sunlight slowly crept across the bed, and Rogue twitched away from it trying to stay in dreamland. 

After several minutes avoiding the rising sun she finally opened her eyes.

âGood morning,â I said as I put the tablet down. 

âGood morning!â said Rogue as she slowly moved up the bed so she was right next to me. 

Reaching out she began to stroke Nakja, who realizing that it was Rogue petting her promptly uncurled and pushed her head into Rogueâs hand. 

For several minutes we all just basked, moments like these were what had made me realize I was really in love with Rogue. To simply be with someone and not even feel the need to speak, to just enjoy being with that person. Her being an alien was something that didnât even really play into it, that was just who she was like her skin color or hair.

âI have to go out and do some errands today, when will the two of you release me?â 

Rogue smiled, and shifted slightly so that the sheet covering her body fell away exposing her skin to the sun and my eyes. 

âAre you sure you want to leave?â she asked playing innocent. 

It took me a moment to recover from her very obvious and not unappreciated distraction, âNo, but I have to get them done at some point.â

âLater then,â Rogue pushed the kitten off of my chest, ever complacent to her demands it promptly hopped off of the bed and quickly walked out of the room no doubt to claw up another corner of the couch. 

Rogue leaned forwards and planted a kiss on my lips, and I didnât care what the cat was doing to the stupid couch for the next hours or so.

&lt;Odd Requests&gt; 

âWhat is it you are looking for?â asked the jeweler. 

I looked up from the display in front of me, he was dressed impeccably to the nines in suit a hard contrast to my jeans and t-shirt but I paid it no mind. 

âTitanium, what do you have in titanium?â I asked. 

The man frowned, âWhat specifically are you looking for?â 

I pulled out the rough sketch I had made copied from Rogueâs tablet, âA cuff bracelet of sorts, fitted to go over the forearm.â 

The man picked up my rough sketch, âAnd you said you wanted this made of titanium? That would make it quite expensive in raw material alone.â 

âThatâs fine, do you know where I can get a bracelet like it?â 

The man considered me for a moment, âI would have to call our warehouse. If youâre willing to pay a stocking fee I can have a selection of bracelets like this in by tomorrow.â 

I pulled out my credit card.

âSo you want the meal to have meat that is hardly cooked?â asked the owner.

I nodded, âTwo meals actually. Iâll need mine a little more on the well done, but my girlfriends foreign and her largest complaint about American cooking is that we burn our meat.â  

The owner smiled and waved his hand, âThatâs easy enough, we get these kinds of requests all of the time. She French?â 

âSomething like that,â I said. 

The man chuckled, âAlright are there any other special considerations?â 

âWeâre going to need a heater up on the deck, itâs not supposed to be cold but sheâs anemic so she gets chilled easily.â 

âThatâs easy enough.â 

âOther than that I have no idea, what do people usually do?â

âI could try and upsell you a whole lot of other fluff, but neither of you are going to remember it. Iâm also getting the impression it wonât matter.â

âWhat makes you say that?â 

The man smiled, âThis is not cheap, and if you donât mind me saying so you donât look like your flush with money. This will be special without any extra embellishment. The extra stuff is for the rich guys and their arm candy. I canât charge the ones who are really in love that kinds of fee.â 

âHow can you tell weâre really in love?â

The old man leaned back in his chair, âI can tell, you look about as giddy as I felt back then. You at least love her, so Iâm betting she loves you.â

Making it home for the night I found the house dark, like it had been when Rogue was at the peak of her cycle. Opening the door I found that the heat was cranked to the max despite the much warmer weather outside as well. 

Stepping inside I slowly crept around the dark hallways of the house. 

âRogue?â I asked keeping my voice as low as possible not sure exactly what was going on. 

There was a thud and a yowl looking down the hallway for the source of the noise I barely saw the black blur that was the cat as she shot down the hallway, claws scrabbling on the tile as she bolted. 

Rogue was chasing after her, almost as impossible to see in the darkness. 

Nakja bolted into the living room with Rogue right behind her and within moments I heard another crash. Tentatively I walked into the room and flipped on the light. 

The couch was on its side and one of the cheaper side tables that usually held the remotes for the TV and everything else was crushed underneath Rogue who was squeezing the cat against her.

Nakja looked thoroughly displeased but held like she was she had no opportunity to scratch at Rogue. 

âWhatâs going on?â I asked not sure I wanted to know. 

Rogue smiled, âIâm teaching her how to hunt!â 

She released the cat, which instead of turning on her leapt out of Rogueâs arm and streaked towards me. Backing away I tripped over something and fell on my ass, the devil of a cat hissed at me once and then shot away back into the dark depths of the house. 

âWhat the hell did I do?â I asked. 

The cat didnât answer. 

Slowly I got back to my feet. 

âYou finish all of those things you had to do?â asked Rogue. 

I nodded, âYep, I also made us dinner reservations for next Saturday.â 

Rogue smiled, âWhere are we going?â she asked.

âThat Italian place down by the water.â 

Her eyes lit up, âOh, fancy!â

&lt;Netflix IV&gt;

âYou mean this actually happened?â asked Rogue. 

I nodded, âItâs based on true events, for once Hollywood had to cut some danger from the movie. They had so many things go wrong on Apollo 13 that itâs nothing short of a miracle.â 

Rogue shook her head in amazement, âHumans are crazy! You did how many of these missions?â 

âSix that landed, at least two more that didnât actually land. Apollo 10 was a test run, and youâre watching what happened to 13.â 

She looked back at the movie. 

âStill crazy.â 

âMost astronauts back then were crazy, they were military test pilots. The current breed are crazy but not in the same way.â 

Rogue leaned back against me and smiled, âYou think Iâm crazy?â she asked. 

I laughed, âWell I wonât deny Iâm envious but from what you told me you never even turned the gravity off. So it was like an airplane ride.â 

âTrue. Still, we never got to land on anything under our own power.â 

âYou sent probes out like us though, and from what I read you had people in orbit during the war like we did during our cold war.â 

âYeah, we never had a moon to land on though, so the first foray would have been to another planet. I guess humans were lucky.â 

âI guess so, I look back on stuff like Apollo and its crazy. We went to the moon with less computational power than whatâs in my pocket!â 

âStill think about it, humans are going to do some crazy stuff in space!â said Rogue. 

I sighed and looked over at the movie, the three astronauts were just beginning to re-enter the atmosphere. The music was cresting toward silence and for the next few minutes both of us watched in silence. 

âThatâs if we can get through the stupid bureaucracy,â I growled. 

âThat must be the one thing thatâs consistent across every world. Everyone hates politicians.â

[Chapter 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3p73q9/oc_life_with_an_alien_girlfriend_ch_7/)

So I've roughly written this out to the end. The total count is going to be nine chapters with perhaps a tenth epilogue chapter. I love these two  more than anyone else, and I've got more scenarios then will fit into these next few chapters but I'd rather end on a note that is appropriate for both a love story and a HFY piece so I'm not going to drag it out. 

Quick question though, if you're not aware some of the writings on my site fall within the more ahem, adult oriented category. I'm toying with writing about what is implied here perhaps during one of Rogue's ten month cycles, but I feel it could very easily ruin the story. I'm willing to take a crack at it if you all would like a scene in the category, I'm not guaranteeing I will publish it. Thoughts?

Amber couldn't help but smile when she saw Freddy there. He had always protected her when ever she was sad or hurt, all she had to was draw the special mark he had taught her. âFweddy!â Her lisp comping out in her excitement to see him sitting on the corner of her bed. As she got closer to him she could smell the scent he always brought with him, one of fireworks or when a bonfire is just starting.

The girl ran up to him, taking his hand in hers as she looked at him. He was smiling down at her, like he always did. Amber couldn't remember a single time where he wasn't smiling with all his perfectly white teeth shown for all to see. Even with his long nails she held on tight to his hand never fearing that he might prick her.

âTell me little one did you call me for some need?â Amber shook her head when he asked. âI was just feeling kinda lonely not seeing you for so long!â The girl smiled trying to get her grin as large as Freddy's, even if she knew her lips couldn't go that far, still she tried.

The two of them spoke for some time, Freddy never showing any sign of tiring of the girl's topics of choice, never missing a beat when she would suddenly change topics with no link except in her mind. Time passed and she ran around her small bedroom as the two of them talked. Eventually the shadows cast from her window started to grow long until finally there was a knock at the door.

Slowly Amber's mother opened the door to see just what her daughter had been doing all this time. She sniffed at the air, almost smelling something, but not quite sure what it was that she was smelling, just that she could. âWhat have you been doing up here all alone?â Wither her large smile and a proud voice the girl proclaimed the truth to her mother. âI've been playing with Freddy!â Amber pointed to where Freddy sat on the side of her bed though her mother never so much as glanced at where he was sitting before replying to Amber. âWere you having a good time with him? Because I think it is about time for you to say good bye for now so we can go and have dinner.â As soon as the words were in the air Amber put on a pout, not wanting to eat dinner instead wanting to continue her play in this room.

âBut mom...â The girl's voice was small in protest. They all knew how this would end, and yet she was still going through the motions. She had to after all, it was only right. As her mother took her hand and lead her out of the room Amber turned back and waved to Freddy, not wanting to leave him there alone. âHow is your imaginary friend doing today?â Amber's mother asked her as they slowly took each step down the stairs. No sooner had the question been asked then Amber stopped moving forwards and puffed her cheeks out. âI keep telling you! He's not imaginary! He's just invisible!â The girl protested before continuing down the stairs with her mother for dinner.

~~

With her hand held by her mother, Amber walked towards her school in the early morning. Her shoes were damp as she tracked through the dew covered grass. It wasn't a long walk from her home, though every day it always seemed like an adventure to her, never knowing which way her mother would choose to take.

As they came up to the front of the school Amber's mom let go of her hand, and knelt down giving the young girl a hug and kisses on her cheek. The woman looked over her daughter once more, straightening the white dress the girl was wearing. âBe a good girl today.â Amber simply smiled a wide smile.

Once this morning ritual was done Amber took off like a shot towards the back of the school where the yard that all the students were expected to congregate before the first bell. When she got to the back she dropped her pastel coloured Lisa Frank backpack with kissing dolphins fall to the ground, the second bag in the line her class would all fall into when they heard the bell.

Amber ran off from the various bags, none of them holding any interest for her when instead she could be sure that her best friends were all about to arrive at any moment. As she ran to the places her friends would normally be playing, she found nothing.

After her third trip around the yard Amber couldn't help but let out a sigh, now finding it clear that none of her friends, best or otherwise had shown up yet. Her gaze went to the forest that the school backed onto, it wasn't large and she had played in it a number of times, both on weekends and during school, even if the teacher always told the students they weren't allowed to. Either way, Amber figured, it was before school even started so she was allowed to.

Amber wondered through the forest, looking for the periodic wild flower. She sang songs to herself from the various cartoon she would watch in the morning, switching at random between them. At first she was looking just to find a flower for her best of best friends, then it expanded to all of her best friends, finally to her entire class, all nineteen of them.

When Amber finally came out of the forest onto the edge of the yard that was now much more lively with the ever growing student population. Still as she looked at this she was struck with a disquieted sense. It took her a moment to realize there were scattered torn papers being blown around the yard that had been pristine before. Looking around she spotted a destroyed backpack, all of its contents that hadn't been strewn across the yard were dumped in a pile, shredded and stomped by small feet.

At first Amber wondered if wild dogs had been the ones who had done this, but with so many other children so merrily playing still that couldn't have been the case. As she got closer to the bag laying there she let out a small gasp, surprised by her recognition of the bag, it had been her bag. The kissing dophins now ripped apart were unmistakeable, she had been the only one in the school lucky enough to have that one, along with the lunch her mom always made her now ground into the dirt under someone's heel.

Before she could bend down to examine the mess in front of her, Amber heard someone call her name. The young girl looked up trying to find the source of the voice, she thought it had come from her right, just on the edge of the forest. With her gaze locked on the edge of the trees she scanned for whomever called her but didn't spot anyone.

A wet thud impacted the side of Amber's head, quickly followed once more by her name being called. This time though she spotted the source out of the corner of her eye, Colleen, the girl she would tell anyone was her 'bestest of best friends'.

Slowly amber turned to face the girl, never raising her hand to see what she had been hit with. The acrid smell and feeling of thick ichor as it slowly oozed down her blonde hair and onto white cotton of her dress. Amber knew that there could be no mistake as to just what she had been pelted with; dog dirt as her mother would have called it.

As Amber turned to look at her friend she was at a loss for words, her mouth just hanging open. Her mind was spinning as she tried to make sense of what was happening, why Colleen was standing there with such a self satisfied grin on her lips.

Colleen was talking but Amber couldn't hear any of the words that she was saying. She just watched her, slowly she realized that there were others there with her, though still they seemed like phantoms she couldn't focus on.

She felt another impact against her body, this time from a different angle, colliding with her chest, breaking a number of the flowers she had still been holding. Everything felt numb in her body as she just stood there watching the world around her move, her feet bolting her there.

As Colleen along with her 18 phantoms placed her finger on her nose turning it up Amber was finally assaulted with the cavalcade of mocking oinks. Finally she broke into a run, through the mocking line of children and into the forest.

Amber simply ran, no idea of where she wanted to go, falling as she went. Before she knew it one of her shoes was lost, her dress was torn and dirtied, where she could no longer tell the difference between where she had been attacked and where she had fallen.

After a particular tumble down a hill Amber had the wind knocked out of her. So instead of running she cried there as she lay flat on her back, the tears flowing over her red face. Finally after losing all sense time she picked herself up, the tears replaced by a rage that shook her to the core, she tried to steady her hands as she stood there.

Slowly as Amber walked forwards to a clear patch of dirt, she became aware of the pain from her scrapped up legs and arm. Picking up a dead branch she scratched the mark Freddy had shown her, calling his name, looking around frantically for her last friend. When he failed to instantly appear before her she collapsed to the ground, pulling her knees up to her chest and proceeded to cry once more.

A warm hand was placed on the top of Amber's head and she looked up to see him, to see Freddy with his impossibly large grin standing there, his dark eyes looking over her. âYou called me, little one?â He asked, saying nothing of her dirty dress and hair, nor her battered arms and legs. âFreddy!â Amber jumped up and wrapped her arm around him.

It was a long time before she was able to say anything as Freddy stood there, giving the small child as much time as she needed. âYo- You said you'd do anything for me, right Freddy?â Amber asked as she spoke into his stomach. Standing there Freddy nodded to her, stroking her dirty hair. âOf course little one, anything that you ask me to.â

Amber's tiny body shook as she stood there, barely able to stand any more. âI want you to punish them, Colleen and all the rest who did this to me.â Freddy stood there, letting out a long sigh as he thought about her request. âAnd what would have me do to them?â His words were slow and exacting as he asked. âWhat ever you want! Send them all to heaven for all I care!â Amber screamed into him, just wanting the pain she was feeling to stop.

Gently Amber could feel Freddy's hand on her arms as he loosened her grip on him. He stepped back, and knelt down so he could be face to face. âI can do as you ask little one, but you must understand it will take a long time before I can see you again, are you okay with this?â He watched the girl, as she stood in front of him with her tear stained face. âFine!â Amber screamed at him, simply wanting that sweet vengeance that only her Freddy could give her.

âVery well my littlest one, I will do as you have asked me. We will not meet again until I have done as you asked of me.â Freddy stood and started to walk away from Amber, never looking back as he did. She started to follow him, wiping the tears away, glancing away from him for only a moment, though long enough for him to disappear.

Amber didn't call out for Freddy, he had disappeared like this before, and calling him again never worked, even drawing the image he had taught her wouldn't work, she was alone now.

Now she could only wander, lost in a daze, through this small forest. It was some time before one of the school's teachers found her, still looking for that lost shoe. Amber was shocked at the reaction, someone had started a rumour about a cougar attacking one of the students and dragging the poor child off.

~~

After a week of staying home Amber finally returned to school, though nothing that Freddy had promised to do for her had come to pass, she still hadn't seen him, even after calling him each night after her parents had tucked her in to bed he hadn't appeared like he promised he always would.

In time Freddy slowly faded from Amber's mind, he had always just been an invisible friend to her, not real like those in her class that had terrorized her that day, in some play to take her down a few pegs, but still from time to time she would still try to summon her friend throughout the rest of the year, only stopping when her mother one day told her that her father had been given a new job and that the family was going to be moving once her school year was over.

~~

With a light drizzle taking over the city Amber absentmindedly store out of the office window ignoring the pile of forms she had to complete for work. This job had been nothing like what she had expected, instead of the exciting and dynamic environment with new challenges it was just her filling out the same four forms each day, pushing them along so they could be stamped.

Her hand was doodling some just what ever it felt like as she listened to the radio playing in the office, they'd cut off the music to talk about a train accident, from everything that was being said it sounded to her like it was something of a miracle, the train had been nearly empty when it derailed, so far only three people had lost their lives: an attendant, a passenger, and some poor person who had been stopped at a railway crossing.

A pair of feet stopped by her desk as continued to stare out the window. âJust leave them on the desk.â Amber said, never bothering to even look at the person who had come up to her desk. She knew who it was, just some intern with a new stack of forms that needed to be filled out, that was the only reason anyone ever came up to her desk.

âIt has been a long time... little one.â The man standing by her desk said. At first Amber simply raised an eyebrow as he spoke to her, not quite sure just who this guy thought he was to speak to her like that, though something in a long forgotten part of her soul screamed at her to remember.

Finally she looked at him, and her voice was stricken from her. The man that was standing there was a horror to behold. The first thing she saw was his long gaunt fingers that continued on long past where she thought they should have ended, in a razor's point ready to render any flesh that he could choose. His face was worse. When she was a child she thought was a smile was a lack of any lips, exposing his teeth from ear to ear, while the dark comforting eyes were impossibly dark sockets that just sat there, she felt like they were peering into her soul.

âIt has been so long, little one.â Amber glanced around wondering just how her coworkers would be reacting to him, but there was nothing, none of them even seemed to notice the three metre horror that she had once thought looked so handsome. âFweddy?â The name came flooding back to Amber as she gasped it out, the lisp reappearing after so many years of being locked away.

âI am glad that you still remember me, and had the foresight to call me on this most glorious of days.â Amber was dumb struck by what he was saying, she hadn't called him and there was nothing to make this day glorious unless you liked some light rain. âWhat, just what do you mean by that?â Amber asked, doing her best to keep her voice down and gaze locked on the space where Freddy's eyes should have been. âHas it been so long little one that you have forgotten what you asked me to do for you?â Freddy asked, tilting his head, now looking to have a grotesque smile.

Amber felt the bottom of her stomach drop as he spoke, but she had to be sure. âJust what did I ask you to do?â Her heart leaped into ears, seeming to try and match the movements of her stomach as she waited for his answer. âWhy I have simply sent them to be in as close a place to heaven as I can get them.â The words were flat as he said them, but all the same it make Amber want to vomit. âHow... how many?â She asked, her gaze falling to the floor not quite able to believe what she was hearing.

She just continued to stare at the floor not quite able to process what Freddy had told her. When a gentle hand was placed on her shoulder she jumped back trying to get out of her chair, but instead falling over it, hitting the ground hard, barely missing the sharp edge of a filing cabinet. She looked up to the person that had touched her and a surprised face was looking back at her. Ed Barr stood there, a look of shock on his face. âA-are you alright?â He managed to stammer out as Amber pulled herself up.

âI... I'm sorry I need to take the rest of the day off.â Amber practically yelled out as she tried her best to escape the office. In her hands she fumbled with her phone, she had to know if what Freddy had told her was real, if she had killed them, nineteen people from her elementary school, could that really be. No, it had to be all crazy talk, something like that simply couldn't have happened.

Slowly though call after call, and having to say the dreaded line âI'm so sorry for you loss.â Only three names from her second grade class remained, unable to reach anyone who knew those three. So Amber waited, glued to the T.V. fearing what Freddy had said applied to those people who had lost their lives from that derailment.

Near morning a break on one of the channels, a victims name had been leaked, the attendant on the train âColleen Rose.â Amber repeated back to herself, unable to believe it.

She wanted to call him, to call Freddy to tell him it had all been wrong, a child's anger that burned so hot though for only an instant, that she wanted him to undo it all.

Just two names left she thought to herself. There was one other question that she had to ask her self even if she was trying to avoid it, the one thing that she knew needed to be asked ever since she saw Freddy for the first time.

Can God even forgive me?

I came into this year thinking I was a life sciences major. However, I'm fucking loving CS right now; I haven't had this much fun in academics ever! It's so satisfying making things, I do my problem sets many days in advance. I'm doing all the  readings and it's going well, but I feel like there's room for me to do more. I want to get more into CS before dropping premed, and explore whether it's the right option for me (I'm in the middle of O-Chem sophomore year, and doing super well already).

So, what should I supplement my class material with? Right now we're just getting into Arrays in java. Should I just do some extra practice problems? Or should I start working on learning how to do a larger project/coding individual things I think of? What should be my goals down the line in the next three years to be the best programmer (and have a good programmer's resume)?

Also, is it reasonable to think that a complete CS novice can get strong internships this summer as a sophomore? I'm taking the CS classes at Harvey Mudd (going to CMC). I'm from Seattle :)

Thanks for the help!!!"

I'm currently a Senior CS student at a university in Boston. I'm taking my last required classes this semester. However, I'm currently having a hard time balancing my classes (all upper-level CS classes) and applying for full time jobs. I don't feel fully comfortable with my algorithms/ interview techniques yet, and my personal projects need some polishing. I have previous internship experience.


I feel that I wouldn't get my first-pick of jobs (at stretch companies like the big 4) since I'm spread so thin this semester. Would it be wise to delay my graduation from this Fall to next Spring in favor of better chances of getting a job I want since I'll have a lot more time to prepare, or should I settle for any job since I'll be entering the workforce earlier and making money? I can afford another semester if needed, just want to do what's best for my career.


Another option is to just graduate, and then focus on applying to jobs afterwards. Do companies /recruiters like this? Or will they be uneasy at the fact that I graduated without a job lined up?

Thanks so much, any input / personal experiences is much appreciated!!"

(Credential Program, English Abroad, or Something Else?)",mauvus,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/3oo7dz/recent_college_graduate_whats_my_next_step/,"Good evening, teachers of reddit. I am a recent college grad and I want to get into the field of teaching; specifically high school English, though I'm open to other grade levels as well.

During college I had decided to become a teacher, but towards the end I was discouraged and let go of that desire because several teachers I talked to seemed disenchanted with the state of teaching in California and highly recommended not to get into it. The many negative posts here also discouraged me from even trying the field out. So, I decided to explore other career paths instead, taking a gap year to do some reflection and try new things. However, in the four months since graduating, I have realized that I would rather give teaching a chance than give up on it so easily; it is something I've wanted to do for years and I want to at least give it my best attempt.

So, here's where I am at. I graduated with an American Literature degree and a minor in Education in June. I have worked in a part-time retail position since July; while I wanted to  volunteer or get an internship during my gap year (or maybe travel; I've been on the fence about it), I did not have the money to fund any of these options. However, I have been saving most/all of my paychecks so I can apply it towards something more meaningful. I have minimal volunteer experience outside of one quarter in a local  high school, as (due to the story in my second paragraph) I did not think I would be going into teaching at all. I have taken the CBEST and applied for an Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teacher credential as well, since originally I intended to do substitute teaching while I figured out what I was doing (and earn more money than my retail job in the process; I understand it is a completely different world from full time teaching).

I have looked into several options, and **tl;dr** I would like to know which is the most realistic and best choice for me to take in the near future, i.e. 1-2 months, and what I should be planning to do longer term, i.e. in the next 6 months to a year.

* **Teach English abroad** - I figure now would be the best time to do this, if I ever do, since I am not tied down to anything but a temporary part time job. I would want to teach in Nepal or Japan ideally. I have done some preliminary research and figured I could fund a short trip (about 3 months?) if I had to do a self-funded volunteer program, though ideally I would like a paid long-term program. I also am not sure on the qualifications for these programs, as I have heard many mixed reports on it (some say the legitimate programs require teaching experience, but programs I've found seem to accept college graduates). Pros: getting to travel abroad, new experiences in other cultures, exciting life experience, looks good on a resume. Cons: Cost, potentially putting off deadlines for credential program applications, some fear of the unknown/living abroad
* **Apply for a credential program** - I could just jump right in and see if anyone will take me. However, without a lot of volunteer experience, I feel like this might be a waste of time; I do not know how selective the programs I plan on applying to are. Pros: If I am accepted, I would be able to enter the working world quickest just by jumping in. Also, while I took a gap year to ""find"" myself, I'm actually very ready to jump back into education and further my knowledge and career. Cons: Probably not going to be accepted, without some other experience first. 
* **Find volunteer work at a local school** - I could start asking around the local high schools and grade schools if they have any open volunteer work available. i'm not exactly sure what this would entail, but I assume it is an option; I haven't researched it too much. Pros: Direct experience in a school could help my resume and let me ""feel out"" the job a bit more. Cons: Last time I volunteered, all the teachers seemed to hate their jobs and it rubbed off on me. Also, lack of pay unless I keep my retail job, which is sucking away at my mental health.
* **Something Else?** - If you have any other suggestions I'll gladly hear it!

Sorry for the long post; I can only hope to get at least one or two people to help me decide. Thank you for your time!"

Moved back to the Seattle area where I grew up at the end of this last spring. I have been doing temp work and tutoring math during my job search. 

Places I have applied have been tech companies, engineering firms, junior software dev positions, data entry, data analyst etc. 

I have had several interviews with different several companies, I get to the final round interviews. I have been complimented on my resume several times, recruiters saying it's very impressive, interviews saying my resume is impressive. I have been told that I come across as very intelligent. 

I have gotten all the interviews through networking, largely because recruiters or contacts are very impressed with my resume. No cold application on line has resulted in an interview, always stating that either they went with a more experienced option or just saying not interested.

I do well enough in the first interview that I get to the second interview every time, do well there as far as I know because a couple of times it resulted in another interview. After the third or second interview the reply is has been that they are declining any further interviews/job offers because a lack of experience. 

I am quick to respond to any form of contact, I send thank you emails to those I have interviewed with right away and mention what we discussed. I am polite with the recruiters, I am polite with my points of contact. 

Is the ""not enough experience "" a way of saying were are not interested? Is it a matter of having enough interviews that I find the one that offers a job? Should I try pursuing internships to gain relevant experience? 

I  feel like I am falling into the cannot get a job without experience, cannot get experience without a job loop. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

While I do not have much professional CS experience, I am fairly confident I am capable of succeeding and doing well with the internship. 

However, I have one problem that concerns me. I attended a different school for a few years and performed poorly at that school, then transferred to the school I am at now about 2 years ago. I transferred in with a GPA of something like 2.4. I am doing better now than I was, however, my GPA has yet to reach that magical 3.0 average that every internship opportunity seems to expect of me. Im currently at a 2.8 GPA, with my CS and engineering classes averaging at about a 3.1

Does anyone have any advise on how I should proceed? Im sure I really shouldn't try to lie about it, as this is information that the company will eventually probably want to have official records of.

I have been lurking for a while now and really enjoy the sub. I am a .NET developer in the Philadelphia area and really love my work. 

I had an internship my senior year of college with a great company and they kept me on full-time after I graduated. At the time, I felt like I got low-balled maybe a bit, but I was just happy they gave me an opportunity and I really enjoyed the place during my internship. 

The offer was $45k, which I accepted. 

One year later, my first raise, was $10k, bringing me to $55k. 

Now I am almost finished with my second year of working full time with the company and am due for another raise at the end of the year. 

I have gotten a great offer from another company doing the same .NET work and it would be over a $20k raise. This is where I am stuck. 

The company I work for now is great and I feel there is a lot of room for growth. They have me taking leadership courses and I assume I will take on a leadership role within the next year. I also am not sure what my raise in the next few months will bring me to.

I didn't tell them that I was in early classes still but they seemed to show interest. Do I bring that up? If they ask something I don't know, do I tell them no I haven't covered that yet? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
3ooe68,4,2015-10-13,Issues with classroom management when co-teacher is gone,machine-of-grace,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/3ooe68/issues_with_classroom_management_when_coteacher/,"I'm a first-year teacher in an ACP, so I did not student-teach. This is my first year of teaching, and it's technically an internship. I am really struggling with classroom management. I co-teach three inclusion ELA 1 classes in a high poverty and rural high school. I also solo-teach a 7 student reading intervention course which is great and co-teach a 30 student inclusion ELA 2 course which is wonderful. I'm twenty-five, the SPED specialist, speak softly due to partial vocal cord paralysis (I wear a personal audio system to compensate), and wear hearing aids. My co-teacher, the content specialist, has fifteen years' experience under her belt. The kids in 6th and 7th periods, which both have thirty or more students and high percentages of SPED kids, respect her far more than they do me. As far as I can tell, they do not respect me at all and will not work for me. I've been dinged by my administration on classroom management, and have been trying to improve; I attended a CHAMPS training last Friday, though I've not had much chance to implement any of the strategies. 

My co-teacher came down with strep yesterday, and so today it was just myself and a substitute. We were reading a play as a class (with assigned roles) in 1st, 6th, and 7th periods. In 1st, we finished the play and most of the classwork, though not all, and I only had to redirect a few times. 

6th and 7th were nightmares. They insisted upon talking while I was talking, couldn't get organized in order to read the play, and constantly argued and talked back to myself, the substitute, and each other.

In 6th, I gave them a class-wide warning, which did nothing. Finally I told them that if they were not willing to learn, they would read the rest of the play and do their work on their own, without my help. I ended up having to take one student (J.D. for clarity) to the office while the substitute remained in the classroom, because he refused to move from his non-assigned seat to his assigned one. In retrospect, I should have just given him detention rather than escalating to an office referral. His tablemate, who has issues with behavior, ended up following myself and JD to the AP's office, though I hadn't given him permission to leave. Since he was already in the AP's office, I left him there and wrote him a referral for leaving the classroom. As 6th ended, two of the better students came up to me and said, ""It's messed up how they treat you."" Honestly, that made me feel worse, because what kind of teacher makes their students feel like they need to comfort them?

7th failed to get organized, not speak while I was speaking, and read the play as well, so within fifteen minutes I told them that they would also have to do their work on their own. (After the whole rigmarole of warnings). One of them (J) kept whistling while I was talking, and his tablemate, B, kept egging him on. So I took them to the office, whereupon the AP and my former mentor who was very unhelpful and unkind and was in the office with her, both stared at me. The AP said, ""Why are you bringing me more?"" I explained that these were 7th period students, while the ones before were from 6th. (I understand now that I should have just gone to issuing detentions rather than sending them directly to the AP, as sending them without writing an ODR in advance just gums up the system - an AP found me after school to express this fact - to say nothing of the administration thinking that I cannot handle a classroom; my mentor says too many ODRs are a red flag and can lead to being put on a growth plan). The substitute and I ended up dividing the class in two, and I took half of them out into the lounge area in the hallway, where they worked through the play and the worksheet.

I'm so frustrated and confused. I have students that truly want to learn in 6th and 7th, but when my co-teacher is out, they don't have the opportunity to, because most of the students in those classes don't respect me. I feel like I'm failing the kids that want to learn, and I'm failing my co-teacher, who should be able to take a day off without fearing that nothing will get done. I've never felt so much at a loss. The problem has to be me; when my co-teacher is there and I'm out, they work well, and when both myself and the co-teacher are there, they work well. Whatever the problem is, it's me, but I don't know what it is about me. 

I'm re-familiarizing myself with the discipline matrix and set a goal to not send any kids to the APs for the rest of the semester. I'm also going to be attending some more classroom management PD, and tomorrow, I'm going to be making a lot of phone calls to parents. But in the meantime, is there anything else I can do to improve my classroom management? I feel like I'm failing my kids and my co-teacher. "
3op97u,40,2015-10-14,"What are the functional differences between learning online, self-taught, and going to an actual university program for computer science?",EvolutionIsFactual,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3op97u/what_are_the_functional_differences_between/,"So let me preface this with saying that I realize college csci programs are geared towards teaching more theory and generalized design vs actual programming of different languages and that would be true of either route one takes. 

By a self-taught program I mean something like this:

https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science

where you get a full curriculum to do using real classes posted online by MIT and Harvard.

I'm guessing there is a lot of lab work in colleges that can't be done with others using the self-taught program but can be substituted with online or at home practice and online collaborations. 
And maybe you can't get an internship?

But other than that, you do get the same lectures other students do, the same tests and reading materials. 

I actually took 3 semesters of comp sci at my local college (I already have a BSc degree in something else and went back for csci later on for 3 semesters) so I have an idea of how it is. I feel like I could actually learn more on my own.

It seems like software jobs care less about degrees than other fields and more about technical skill and experience. Given that one DOES have technical skill and experience, how would you articulate your online/self-taught education on say a resume to be something that helps you get an edge over other candidates?"

I started applying to a lot of companies in the last few days, and I was just rejected by Facebook for an interview. The recruiter said that ""This was a tough decision since there are so many talented candidates, but I'm afraid we will not be moving forward with your candidacy."". I really wanted to get an interview, and did the best I could to make a have a great application:
- I was recommended by a Facebook FTE
- I have 3 internships at top companies doing interesting projects
- I made a nice cover letter (see below)
- I go to a ""target school"" for my country, where we had Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Palantir and other companies come and recruit.

I consider myself good at programming and interviewing, I'm good at algorithms, I passed interviews with Microsoft and Google in the past, and I was very confident about my chances.

Here's my summary:
""
I am a Senior Computer Science student with extensive experience in industry given by my 3 internships in top software companies. I am very passionate about programming and want to become the best software engineer I can be.

I am comfortable at all levels of the programming stack, from assembly to python, from embedded programming (Microsoft) to distributed systems (Adobe), although I prefer lower level programming. I care a lot about proper design and making things correct, fast and scalable.

I am looking for an internship after my graduation in June 2016, and thinking about full time employment if I find a team where I feel I can work hard and make a big impact.
"".
I also wrote some stuff about some volunteering work and some other achievements in the proper boxes. Here's my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7c8byo5qxzdhmhc/resume.pdf?dl=0) .

Please let me know if you have any advice about what I could have done better.

Today, I just came back from an interview. I had to write down a general application on myself. I lied that during my summer I did an unpaid internship at a hostel working as a receptionist for 3 months back in my home country. 

Now, I regret that I did such a thing. I had to sign my signature at the end of the application, however I am not sure if it meant consent for a background check.

Now I am pretty worried that the company will review my background and employment history for the 6 months internship placement on details of my 3 months receptionist job. From now on, I will not lie. I have edited my details on my resume now.

I wanted to ask, are they going to do an extensive check on my employment history?

This is in Hong Kong if that is if further help.

1.What else do I need to know for front end or is this enough? 

2. How do I go about learning backend? Because I heard python is used in both web development as well as in artificial intelligence. 

3. I want to learn AI in the next two years before I do my masters in this subject. What can I do to make my resume better wrt AI?

All this time, I thought that one day I would suddenly enjoy the programming side of my career since I want to stick within Software. I've tried learning my way around the full stack and have had experience in such a wide variety in software.

But I'm finally starting to realize that I don't like coding. Yes, I might be good at it...but I don't enjoy it. I feel like I wasted my current and previous co-ops as a software developer and my major where I want to get into product management now or stick with IT Project Management since they seem doable to me.

Hi guys! I graduated May 2015 from a major university in Florida with a degree in Information Technology. I wasn't able to do an internship during this time due to my full time job at my restaurant. 

Currently, I'm a manager/driver for a small restaurant. I've been with the restaurant for 9 years. Unfortunately, I'm unable to find an IT position here in central Florida. 

This is what I typically do every day for an hour or two (I work full time, so time is short!)

* Check all emails: All of the major sites send me emails with possible jobs based on location/keyword hits

* Check the top 50 companies locally for openings

* Manually check the major job sites just in case the emails missed stuff

* At the end of this month I will be going to a local tech meetup to pass out my resume

* I also have my resume being sent around to several big companies locally, but there aren't any positions available.

I'm applying for any help desk 1/2, any specialist 1/2, any ""junior"" position and I've even started applying for entry level programming positions even though I despise programming.  


I believe what is holding me back is my lack of experience as well as certifications. I'm currently pursuing my CCENT/CCNA, but I opted to skip over the A+/Network+ a while ago.

Here is my current [resume](http://imgur.com/osHW3LY).


Any recommendations? I've been on several interviews, and 2 out of the 4 thought I was over-qualified for an entry level help desk and they were worried I would get bored. We had started discussing some ccna/networking stuff during the interview.

The only position I was offered was an hour away for $13 an hour which wasn't enough to justify the drive.


Should I keep studying for my CCNA while looking? Any tips?

3oqims,1,2015-10-14,Unpaid Internship,d4ctyler,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3oqims/unpaid_internship/,"So i'm a junior who started looking for internships over the summer and the fall of next year and havent gotten much response from the companies i've applied to(~30). However one company called me in for an interview. Well, they offered me the part time internship for the fall of 2016, but the main problem is the fact that it is unpaid. 

I know a lot of people here are very negative about unpaid work, and would like to get your input. I feel like if I get experience from this internship, I could then get a paid internship in the summer with more ease. Also, I feel like this internship is the exact type of job that I would want (back- end development with rails) and the developers that I met with seemed super nice and were capable of helping me learn a lot. 

What would you say? I think I would learn a lot and am fearful that I won't be able to get a paid internship with my prior experience right now. Would working unpaid for a semester pay off it means an easier time getting offers in the summer? And is it too much of a risk to ask them for some sort of compensation? Thanks  guys."

3or5hb,409,2015-10-14,"If you were watching Buffalo Community TV last night and saw the reporter freaking out, it was me. I'm sorry.",manen_lyset,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3or5hb/if_you_were_watching_buffalo_community_tv_last/,"I'm not sure if anyone saw that happened last night. By the time things got *really* bad, I was hiding under the desk in the fetal position and bawling my eyes out, too busy to notice whether or not the camera was still rolling. I've got a feeling I'm going to wake up in a few days and find the footage on Youtube. **EPIC news fail**, it'll say. 2 million hits. Everyone will be laughing at me. This is the kind of shit that can ruin a career in the news industry before it even begins. No legitimate network will ever even consider *looking* at my portfolio, let alone hire me. God, I hope no one was watching last night, but if you were, I owe you an apology and an explanation. I need you to know exactly *what* lead up to the flurry of guttural screams and blood-curdling bellows you heard during the broadcast.

Last night, I stayed after work to get some studying done. The studio was quieter than my apartment and the producer didn't mind my presence, as long as I didn't disturb the crew. Most nights, I handled the 5:00 o'clock news segment, after which I found an empty desk in the back and studied until about 8:00 pm. Yesterday, however, I was so focused on mid-terms that I lost track of time. It was 10:30 pm when I finally started packing up. That's when the cameraman, Jeremy, approached me and said I was needed for the 11:00 o'clock news segment. The usual reporter apparently hadn't shown up.

Now, I probably should have been a little suspicious. To call Jeremy my ""rival"" would be giving him way too much credit, but it was no secret we didn't exactly see eye to eye. The guy had it out for me, and he'd often try to stump me mid-broadcast. You see, we were both in the same media class and both wanted to be reporters, but as they say, he had a face for radio. That ugly mug of his was the main reason I managed to beat him out and get the position of news anchor. He was none too happy about playing second fiddle, but kept his mouth shut around our colleagues. I guess he was hoping he'd get me to mess up enough times that they'd replace me with him. I was determined not to let that happen. Regardless of his many sabotage attempts, I kept a professional demeanor at all times. That's what they paid me for. Or, that's what they *would* have paid me for, if they paid me. Like I said, it was community TV, where almost everyone was a volunteer. The gig was just a stepping-stone for me. I was trying to catch the attention of a real news network. If I could show them that I could handle myself professionally, it'd help my prospects when applying for internships and, if all went well, a job as a news anchor. But back to Jeremy, the guy behind the camera. You could almost see the smoke blowing out of his ears whenever I managed to spin his curve balls back in his face. I was his *Gary Oak*, but he was just an annoying little mosquito buzzing in my ear.

So anyways, I agreed to fill in for the missing reporter. I took a seat at the news desk in our humble studio, and started reading the bulletins as they flew by on the teleprompter. I was halfway through a fluff piece â a story about a vegan pet food bake sale â when the teleprompter went on the fritz. I knew right away who was to blame for the malfunction. As text fizzled with static, I subtly shot a glare towards Jeremy, but realized he was gone. The camera was still on its tripod and pointing at me, the little red indicator light was still blinking to tell me it was recording, but there was no sign of Jeremy. Where had he gone? He'd been there moments before. *Whatever*, I thought, *he's probably taking a piss*.

With few options at my disposal, I flipped through my notes and moved on to sports. The last thing I wanted was for our viewers to see dead air. As I started listing stats and ad-libbing my way through the segment, I noticed Jeremy off in the distance. He was leering at me from across the studio, with so much hatred that I actually felt a twinge of pain in my chest. He looked just about ready to kill me. Was he *that* upset that his little stunt hadn't worked? I chose to ignore him and keep going, but as he limped closer like a half-baked zombie, I realized he was bleeding from the head. I could see sagging skin, darkened eyes, rotten flesh---he'd gone all out. *Fucking Jeremy*, I thought while keeping a stoic face, *always trying to mess with me*.

In hindsight, I should have realized this was beyond the scope what he was capable of, but you have to understand just how often this guy messed with me. I figured he got his hands on the Halloween decorations that the station owner bought earlier that day. Damned if I knew how he managed to apply the make-up *that* quickly, but this was just the kind of shit Jeremy would do. He wanted to scare me. He wanted to record me screaming on-camera. I wasn't going to give him the satisfaction.

Again, I ignored him and kept going. That is, until he reached the large glass wall that separated the recording studio from the office. Jeremy walked right through the thick soundproof glass, and though I tried to convince myself that the whole studio was in on the joke, that they had, together, removed the glass pane so they could play a Halloween prank on me, I knew the truth. In my heart, I knew the truth. I could still see my reflection as he walked through it. I knew it was still there, though I didn't want to admit it to myself. The goose bumps on my skin went from small hills to mountains as he continued his jagged path towards me. He stretched out a bloodied arm that trembled like a branch in the autumn breeze. I could see bones sticking out, but I still tried to deny what I was seeing.

Until I saw him step *through* the camera.

That's when the screaming started. My screams, I mean. If you were tuning in, that was the exact moment when my expression turned from a peaceful walk in the park to holy shit a chainsaw murderer is running after me. Screw the professional faÃ§ade: I was playing a game of supernatural chicken, and this *thing* was winning. I started chucking objects at the ghostly apparition. I mean, what else was I supposed to do? How was I supposed to defend myself? I threw my notes, my pen, the microphone, a decorative globe, and even my nametag. Everything I threw passed through him as though he was made of smoke. Though I wanted nothing more than to regain my composure and think through the situation like a rational adult, I just kept screaming like an overzealous teenager at a boy band concert, minus the ""MARRY ME"" sign full of glitter.

Then, the lights went out, plunging me in near-total darkness. All I could see was a tiny red dot straight in front of me. The camera was still on. I fell into my chair, legs too shaky to hold me upright. I felt a breath against the back of my neck. Cold, humid air that smelled like worms wriggling in the rain. I could hear a nauseating sound like that of gums smacking together repeatedly. At that point, I threw myself on the floor, rolled under the desk, curled up in the fetal position, and started crying hysterically. The lights came back on within moments, revealing an empty studio. Fucking empty. No Jeremy, no ghost, nothing. Just an empty room with a single camera on its tripod. The only evidence that anything had happened was the lingering stench of worms in the air, and the trail of blood leading from the back of the office to my desk.

I jumped over the desk and accidentally knocked the camera down as I ran out of the studio.

I have no intentions of going on the air tonight. Or any other night. I am *never* stepping foot in that studio ever again. All I can do now is sit back and hope that the footage doesn't get leaked, so I can put this behind me and hopefully find a job elsewhere.

Oh, and one last thing. I don't know how I didn't know this before, we don't even *have* an 11:00 o'clock news segment. The channel loops community ads from 7:00 pm to 6:00 am. Damned if I know whether the Jeremy that asked me to stay late was real, or if it was his horrific doppelgÃ¤nger. Either way, he got what he wanted: my job.

3ord4i,6,2015-10-14,I want to quit my job after 1.5 years.,ThrowAwayChampion1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ord4i/i_want_to_quit_my_job_after_15_years/,"This is somewhat to vent and somewhat to solicit real advice.

I've been in my current position for about a year and a half. It is my first software engineering job straight out of college. At the start it was great, I had a mentor about 2 years older than myself who helped me get the ropes of my current position and served well as a ""senior"" software engineer that I could learn from. I also worked with an intern who was pretty much my age in college and overall I was learning a ton and work was fun. 

Then what happened next was the senior software engineer who was serving as a mentor left for another team and I was left with only one other person on my team who was newer than me to the company but was also a bit more experienced as an engineer and significantly older. I found it hard to have much in common but we always got along and nothing to this day ever resulted in an argument. However I always felt it wasn't a clear mentor relationship before and I wasn't always comfortable asking questions from them since it seemed I should know these things since I was in the company 3 months before they were hired. Its turned into more of a competitive relationship where we try to solve problems and it feels they don't respect me enough to leave me to try to solve problems on my own, I don't feel very encouraged when if I can't solve a problem immediately they will pretty much take over. 

I feel without a direct mentor on my team I've been kind of left to my own for growth and while I feel I can do the job, I don't feel I am learning much anymore. My job is to write test automation software but in my day to day I hardly have to code, maybe update an options file or write a new test every few months that takes maybe a few days. Most of my time is dealing with the testing group and making sure the tests run smoothly, and much of that is just sending emails back and forth and communication. 

I feel this is not what I signed up for as a software engineer, I expected more mentorship and more coding and its gotten to the point where I am not interested in the projects I am given and I am absolutely frustrated by the lack of mentorship. I need to learn in my career and when there isn't a clear mentor I feel its time to leave.

Now those were the bad points, the good points is that I never work overtime and my manager is not a micromanager which I would hate. However I feel I am being micromanaged by my partner sometimes because they will check up every day on what I am doing which is understandable. I don't have BAD relationships with anyone in the office and I have not received a single word of negative review but in my own estimation I have not learned enough especially in this past year since I already know enough about BASH and coding to do the relatively simple test automation script changes we occasionally need. I also have to deal with a ton of office politics which I also feel as a first year software engineer I should not be this exposed to. What I mean is that a senior software engineer or manager should be the ones to deal with other departments but instead they are coming to me asking for software to be delivery dates and occasional requests to speed up releases to meet testing.

I want to quit my job, its gotten worse steadily over the months and I am looking for new jobs right now, just not hard enough. My dilemma is my marketable skills in JAVA have declined since I've only written in BASH scripts here and I have not kept up with coding outside of work. I am not sure if I can find a new job quickly that is to my liking so I would like to quit. However the reality is that I know it is hard to get a job once you quit and I feel like I can hang on until a better opportunity appears.

No TLDR but I would like feedback on whether this is normal for a new software engineer and how to find a better situation for my next job."

Guess I'm just ranting. I really hate sucking so much. I interviewed with Bloomberg for an internship and got rejected. I interviewed with Facebook for an internship and even after a guy at the company vouched for me I got rejected. 

I really, really, really hate being so bad at this shit that I can't seem to solve basic problems such as a rotated array or shit like that. I don't even see what the point of trying is anymore. I'm clearly never going to get anywhere that people give a shit about. I've been rejected by Google and Microsoft last year after interviews so clearly I am just not good at coding or computer science. 

It's really fucking with my head now. I have a test tomorrow, and all i can think about is how much I suck. Like what's the point, I'll end up working if I'm lucky at some no-name company with below-average to average salary in some cubicle and everything will be for naught. I almost want to just email the recruiter and ask what I did wrong, just so I can hear her say that ""you just are a terrible coder"", but obviously people don't give feedback. 

This is irrelevant but, usually before interviews or big events, I do these small things throughout my day that I think are magically going to help. Really small habits like landing on a specific foot when going down the stairs. Obviously it means nothing but sometimes if I do it enough I get convinced that it will actually work. At least the good thing that comes out of this is that I'll stop believing in stupid shit like that.

I just wish I didn't suck. It's clear it's impossible for me to ever get an internship at a big company.

**Hopeful major:** Public Health or Political Science



A couple questions:

*What are my chances at JHU RD vs ED? Can I get in RD?

*What should I be thinking about when making the choice whether or not to ED? I like Hopkins a lot, but I've heard about things like grade deflation that make me really worried for how well I would do there, especially considering GPA matters for things like grad school or med school

*Are there other schools similar to Hopkins but less cutthroat that I should be looking into?

*The other colleges I'm applying to are: Tufts, UChicago (EA), Duke, Cornell, Washington St. Louis, Princeton, Georgetown, Columbia, UMich (EA), Rutgers (EA). What do my chances look like for these, especially Tufts, Wash U, and UChicago?

So far, I've done a very minimal amount of C++ in highschool, a minimal amount of C in college, and a hefty majority of Java for the rest of my programming courses. And even with that, I haven't done very much ""actual"" application making at all. Nearly every project I've done has been in the console which, I'm assuming, is not going to be what I'd be doing if I got a job programming. So I'd like to get more familiar with programming with graphics/GUIs/etc.

 I feel like if I started my own personal project on an app or a game or something I could really start to develop some more skills in programming, and maybe even pickup another language in doing so. (Though it'd be fine to work in Java, it'd still just be nice practice. Maybe even preferred to start in Java if that's possible) Not really sure where to even begin with doing something like an iPhone app or doing something like a small computer game with graphics, though. I'm sure I could find loads of resources with a quick google search, but I feel like having someone give some actual recommendations for what would be best will be more beneficial than picking what I need at random."

I go to a top CS school and am doing relatively decent in my classes. I study hard so I usually manage to get a C+ or B without truly understanding the material. This is an issue that has haunted me since Freshman year. I've been ""passing"" by in my classes.

Now I'm taking much harder classes- include a notoriously hard algorithms class, and I'm having trouble with the material. I'm bottom in terms of class rank and honestly don't know what to do. This major is hard, but I've made it through 3 years and don't want to drop the ball when I really only have like 2 semesters worth classes left. 

I'll be graduating with a crud GPA. I am passionate about Computer Science. I managed to get an internship over the summer by showing my extracurricular projects off. But the reality is that I lack a fundamental understanding of basic topics. I try hard in my classes but I can't grasp a lot of concepts. I usually spend the summers trying to relearn the course material.

 Some interviewers can tell I lack a fundamental understanding, others see what I have accomplished in my extracurriculars and don't ask. Has anyone been in my situation that can share some light on how their experience was?

There are a lot of things I like about my job; my team is very laid back and generally very helpful, the hours are flexible, and the work-life balance is perfect for me. Also, the salary and benefits seem very fair for a new grad (~84k Boston area).

The main issue I'm having is the work itself.. The vast majority of the development work I do comes down to using a very specific tool to map data movement (Informatica) or writing batch scripts to automate ETL process (Autosys). I don't necessarily dislike using these technologies but I often feel like I'm not really ""coding"" at my job when using them. I've lately begun to lose a bit of steam/enthusiasm at work, using the GUI-based Informatica and writing simple bash scripts over and over. I worry that I might pigeonhole myself by kicking off my career using such a ETL-specific technology stack.

I loved using languages like Java and C# at past internships and school/personal projects (particulary enjoyed working on mobile app projects) and am starting to wonder if the ETL/Data Warehouse area is a good fit for me..

The main questions I have are:

* How difficult is it to transition between the different fields as a developer, when the stacks are very different? (such as from ETL to Mobile development)
*  How do you (personally) balance between things such as: salary, benefits, work-life balance VS work satisfaction/passion?


Any tips/thoughts are appreciated!

The job isn't the traditional ""consultant/analyst"" where you're mostly at the HQ with occasional travel. This job is basically Monday to Friday you're away for business wherever you're required to be.

They ask for 2-3 years experience with MBA/Masters being an asset.

Now, obviously I will use the key elements related to the company, position, etc.. but I feel like I'm walking into an interview where I have zero chance of getting the job, how do I change their mind?

What I do have:

I did my bachelor's in engineering and I have 4 internship terms under my belt, all at well renowned companies in the area. I don't have a masters but I applied to one part time starting in January. Finally, I will be doing the CAPM exam in the near future.

A big question for me is:

- Do I tell them I'm doing a masters part time or will that scare them off?

Also, what are key attributes a consulting recruiter would look at. I always get this question and don't know how to answer it perfectly:

""Why would we choose you instead of our other candidates? What makes you different?""

I usually cite my hard work, proven adaptability(I had diverse internships) and my willingness to continue learning(hence the CAPM certification and things of this nature).

Yet, I always feel as though it's not the answer they want. Any tips?"

3otwpq,5,2015-10-15,"With my education and military experience, but otherwise limited background, what kind of jobs should I search for?",MRistheBestRank,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3otwpq/with_my_education_and_military_experience_but/,"Here's the rundown minus identifying information since my peers don't know I'm getting out of the military and that kind of thing changes attitudes.


1. Started running out of money in college, enlisted in the military. Managed to finish my B.S. in physics via distance learning program at my university, but my GPA was nothing spectacular 2.7 maybe. Irrelevant liberal arts minor, sucked too bad at math test taking to consider that for minor. I got the concepts fine and handled everything perfectly when using computer software to do the heavy lifting but choked when there was a time limit on tests.

2. After finishing my B.S. I started looking for a program to use the military's tuition reimbursement for graduate school. Found a M.S. in Engineering Management from a legitimate university, which I thought was kind of like a MBA for engineers/scientists, and there were no other programs that looked remotely relevant that were online only. I took a few prerequisites and got in the program and worked my ass off to get A's in every class. I don't know if this degree will even help me, but it only cost me about $1,500 in books so I'm not out much if it doesn't.

3. I have taken a few college classes in programming, but otherwise no formal education.  However, I have done it extensively in my free time for more than a decade in multiple languages. I'm familiar with various operating systems.  I'm a definite nerd/tinkerer with electronics, making all kinds of random sensors and machines from off the shelf parts and open source platforms like Arduino, etc. Aside from that, I'm into personal finances, number crunching, and I love making spreadsheets for everything.

4. My job in the military hasn't had me do anything special, but I have done my job very well and moved up accordingly. That said, I am getting out without a doubt. Military life is not for me and I have no aspirations of staying in, even becoming and officer and getting paid more wouldn't persuade me to stay.  The experience from my military job is largely useless once I get out aside from supervising small teams (less than 10-15 people) and good characteristics such as punctuality, overt politeness, and the kind of calm demeanor that only comes from working in really shitty conditions. I have no debt 6-8 months expenses saved up, depending on where I live. I have a few family members scattered around in different states that have offered to take me in while I job hunt so I might not even have to dip into it.

5. I haven't used my GI Bill, the military's equivalent of tuition reimbursement has paid for everything so far. So that can be used for further education if need be. It fully pays tuition, book allowance, and a monthly living allowance for 36 months (4 academic years). I think I have 10-15 years after leaving service to use this.


Now that the background/circumstances are out of the way, my problem can be summed up pretty easily: **I have no idea what kind of job to look for or what I would even be qualified for. I'm not even sure what fields I should be considering.**

Unfortunately, I have no real experience or internships outside of the military other than the multiple part time jobs I had through college.  I'm willing to work my way up from the bottom if I have to, although I would hope I could at least start somewhere reasonable in pay. 

If my options don't pan out in the first few years, my plan B is to go back and get a computer science degree and just cash in on being a programmer / software engineer which is what I probably should have done from the start. But at this point in my life, I'd like to avoid having to do a full restart like that.


**tl;dr:** B.S. physics mediocre gpa and M.S. engineering management (from real schools, not for-profit places), programming hobbyist without formal education, some years in the military but no other experience/internships. Want to make money without weapons and camouflage. No debt and still have GI Bill if I need to pop smoke and start over. No clue what kind of job options I have."

Basically I have 2 Workbooks or even 2 sheets in one workbook. 
There are values in column A of the first book that I want to look up in the second book. However in the second book, also column A, the values occur multiple times/duplicates so a simple vlookup doesn't work properly. 
I want to output the values from column B of the second book in column D of the first one. In case of duplicates I want the extra values to be output in column E, F and so on.
As a side not the first book has about 3000 rows, the second one 1800+ so the less processing it takes the better I guess.

My only worry is that I thought I was applying for a software developer internship, but it turns out the position is a more general IT job. 

During the interview they told me what my responsibilities would be: I would essentially be a junior developer developer (not really an intern) working directly with the team on any of the projects the company has, which includes internal tools used by the non-IT staff, 'devops' (not sure if the correct term) projects used by the IT staff (for example, Jenkins scripts and other tools), public-facing and internal servers running the company's tools and websites, and a few software projects like internal and public websites and APIs. 

They showed me a list of potential projects I would be working on and practically none of them involved programming, except for the occasional bash script or something. The interview sort of confirmed this; for example, of the three whiteboard problems I was asked, one was a trivial fizz-buzz-esque programming question and the other two were discussing how I would manage and design a certain network or server. 

The pay is good, it's close to where I live and it doesn't sound like it'll be boring. My only issue is that if the work is primarily sysadmin work, I'm not sure how I would be able to sell it as a relevant internship to employers after I graduate. It's pretty early in the school year and I haven't yet been able to get any other internship. I'm worried that if I accept this offer, I may get an offer in the next few months for a software development internship that I won't be able to do, and I'll be stuck with something on my resume that's not really relevant.

Since I haven't taken this class yet, I am terrified that I will not do well in my upcoming interviews due to a lack of knowledge. By the time summer arrives I will have this knowledge and do well! However, I need to secure an internship now. Advise???"
3ovedc,51,2015-10-15,"Internship Shenanigans, if you have interns PLEASE don't ever jerk them around like this",Higglypuff,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ovedc/internship_shenanigans_if_you_have_interns_please/,"I spent this past summer interning for a small, kickass, start-up that's very well connected in my field. I picked them over two other (more lucrative) offers because their VP &amp; CEO assured me from the first interview, that even if they chose not to hire me, they would make sure I was ""introduced to their partners in the industry"".


*Fast forward 3 weeks into the job*, The CEO is impressed &amp; makes me a verbal offer. He says, Higglypuff, you are the future of this company and I would love for you to join our team.


*As the summer goes on*, The CEO repeats these sentiments at least once a week. We negotiate a job title and salary, which he claims he's comfortable with. I ask for it in writing; he turns into Carmen Sandiego. Every week he says that he just ""needs one more week to finalize the paperwork"". I foolishly believe him and don't go job-hunting. 


*One week left in the internship*, The VP asks if I can do some side projects for her.  I have zero interest; the work she was asking me to do is something I'm good at but particularly dislike.   Still... I feel I have no choice but to say yes. Anything to get that full time written offer. I send her a budget and a timetable which she enthusiastically agrees to. I work hard to produce a good product and many drafts/proofs for her.


*End of internship*- I walk out of the internship with nothing but a plant and a cheesy note reading "" I hope we can grow together"". I'm not super worried though, because hey, I'm still getting a check for the side project. That should tide me over while I job-hunt.


*Two weeks post internship*, Since the internship ended, every single person in the 7 person company has been sending me emailed updates about how close they are to hiring me. Finally, CEO asks if we can meet up for sake &amp; sushi. I was SO excited, it sounds like he finally got the paperwork together and wants to celebrate. But he forgets about the meeting and leaves me sitting there for a half hour before emailing a reschedule request. At that second meeting there is no paperwork. Instead, he pumps me for suggestions about a critical project I was working on. In frustration, I ask him about the big industry conference coming up. Am I going as a company rep or as a job-seeker? He looks sheepish and informs me I'm going as a job-seeker (""but he's working as hard as he can on it"").

*This morning*, I received two emails. The icing on the cake so to speak.  Another one from the CEO updating me about his (lack of) progress. One from the VP, who is almost a month behind on paying me, informing me that she has decided that one part of the eight piece project is not to her liking. As a result, she will only be paying me half of what we agreed upon. Now, I've been meticulous about sending her lots of updates and proofs before the final version. She'd already said she was cool with the project part in contention. This is unprofessional behavior and I'm angry. She's taking my labor &amp; not paying me for it. Frankly, I have no desire to work with her again in any capacity because of this.


So basically, I'm done with the internship company even though they still claim they want to hire me. I've been job hunting but it's not getting as far as I'd like. It would be way more effective if I had the C-Suite making introductions for me as they had *initially claimed they would*. It's a tricky situation because of the history and I'm not sure how to handle it. Does any one have any suggestions for how I could ask him to do this for me? Should I just keep looking on my own?

tl;dr Do I ask my old boss, who maybe still wants to hire me, for introductions to people so I can jobhunt more effectively?"

People who hired for back end developing looking for dudes strong in C++, Java and sometimes c# to complement.

And then there were the ones who hired front end developers... And the languages varied wildly as  far as requirements. It could have been literally anything that is high level programming.


Right now I am doing lots of planning for my winter project with some friends. And it will be a very flashy project that is Arduino oriented. We will make a proof of concept and maybe commercialize it.

I want to focus in one: Either front end or back end development and I want to know if a project with Arduinos that involves sensors, motors, and programming would maybe help me get an internship in National Instruments, Texas Instruments or other software-Hardware companies. As well as maybe a job in purely c++.

Should I change the kind of project for my winter break?"

3owawm,0,2015-10-15,Appdevelopment at a community college,clyzev1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3owawm/appdevelopment_at_a_community_college/,"Afcourse i dont blame the school or the teachers in the end, because i am the one who needs to learn. 

But what to do when you joined a bad school? 

You want to become a better programmer, but the lessons are unorganised and low quality. Most of the students are just playing games or checking facebook.

It's hard to study because of low quality lessons and the noise of the students or the teacher that is talking about hes experience but didnt realise that it took him 5 weeks to guide the class into install a framework, 5 weeks long.. There are even worse teachers. But i rather keep quit and say it is a bad school.

Even if you want to do some extra work because you finished your own work that school gives you it is hard to keep your focus because the class is so fuking loud and lazy and everything but learbing how to code except a small group of 2-3 people who litaterelly said fuk you to the teacher this day because they told us to search an internship in 10 weeks instead of atleast 6 months.

It's a community college in Holland that i follow my  3 year long course called appdevelopment. We focus on webdevelopment.

My next goal is a bachelor in software engineering and a master in computer science. I think those courses will be much higher in quality and much more fun."
3owicu,7,2015-10-15,Strange feedback from Deloitte following an interview,throwaway_627_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3owicu/strange_feedback_from_deloitte_following_an/,"So basically, I've been trying to look for a job for about 3-4 months after graduating, not had the best of luck so far.

I was contacted the other week by a recruitment agency asking me if I wanted to apply for a temporary 4-5 month contracting position with Deloitte (in the UK) as a first line data analyst (mostly excel and SQL stuff), specifically for graduates, which I of course wanted to go for, as this was exactly the sort of thing I wanted.


So I have my interview, they ask me to solve a few problems, however, I didn't really realise that they wanted me to use excel or SQL functions to answer most of the questions with, so I loosely described how I would answer each of these questions with Java, I got all of them right and the interviewer seemed happy with my answers. I thought that these questions were more complicated than they were, so I think I may have overlooked some easier solutions. However, my answers were nothing outstanding at all, they were still very basic (the questions were pretty simple - how would you find the largest number in a list of numbers, things like that).


I had a second interview straight after my first, and this is about my experiences and whether I'd fit in. During this part, the interviewer stressed heavily how good Deloitte would be on a CV/Resume. I had also mentioned to both interviewers that I was planning on doing an internship in New York next August, and that this temporary role would therefore be perfect. I even asked if they would see this as a hindrance in their decision, to which they said no. They also said that I should apply for one of their graduate schemes (basically a 2-3 year graduate role) but as I was planning to move to NYC, I haven't applied to these - which I made clear to them, and they understood. However I did say that I may apply to that after coming back from NYC - and the interviewer said how good this role would be as an experience if I wanted to go for the graduate scheme in the future.


Additionally, when I asked towards the end of the interview when I may hear back, i was told it would be next week (as in this week now), and shortly after, the guy said to me something along the lines of 'we're looking to grow the team by 15-20, you're a smart man, you can work out what that means', which I interpreted as him strongly implying that they were going to offer it to me - particularly as we had just had a lengthy chat about how good this role would be for my future aspirations. 


So I contacted the recruitment agency today (as the role was dealt with through them) - they didn't contact me about it first, which I found odd, and they told me that Deloitte said that I have been rejected because they thought I would not fit in to the team - stating that this was because I was 'overqualified' and would be difficult to manage due to my skills and that I should apply for their graduate schemes instead.


I am absolutely perplexed by this decision. It completely contradicts what went on in my interview. I am certainly not overqualified for this role, the only indication that I may be slightly overqualified is that I answered the questions with explaining what I would do in java - but in the job description, it states that knowledge of object oriented programming languages is not a requirement, but would be beneficial! In any case, this sounds like a fairly technical job, specifically for graduates. If anything, I would consider myself under qualified - I barely even know java any more anyway, it has gone completely rusty and I was not great at it in the first place. 

I have my degree (Computer Science and Business, first class) and a few extra curricular things, and an internship as a software tester - nothing particularly special about any of these things, and these are all qualifications they were aware of before I even had my interview.

I also stated that I would not be able to apply for their graduate scheme because I would be in New York by the time that it started, and that was fully discussed and understood during the interview.

The interview was also extremely positive, possibly the best I've ever had. I cannot think of anything that I would have done to give them a reason to reject me. I did not come across as dominant or difficult to manage at all, my 'soft skills' were very in check for this interview.

I have responded to the recruitment agency explaining what has happened and I have asked for a reconsideration or for more reasoning as I am not really prepared to just accept a rejection after that interview. I'm not very hopeful at all though, I can't imagine they will give me much more of an explanation or go back on their original decision. It's totally confusing. It almost feels like there is another reason that they aren't telling me - but I can't think what it would be at all.

Anyone have any idea what it may be?"

3owk01,2,2015-10-15,Dealing with my past.,S1DEC0NtR0L,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3owk01/dealing_with_my_past/,"Hello all, 

I am looking for some advice. To start with some background: I am almost 30 years old, I graduated college 3 years ago after I went back to school to pursue a my dream of working in public policy. My last semester I landed a very prestigious internship with a top state lobbying firm, graduated, went to work for a state agency, and then transitioned back to working for a small contract lobbying firm- which I loved.

 Also, around the time that I graduated school I sustained a significant spinal cord injury that severely affected my work performance and my quality of life. Most days I was in so much pain I could barely get out of bed, walk, function. 

My employer was a small firm that didn't offer any type of short term disability, and I have two kids to support, so I tried to bite down on my mouthpiece and gut it out. At first, my employer was understanding enough to give me time off from work unpaid so I could have the first of what would be 3 back surgeries.

 A long story short, the surgery was not successful and I was still in an incredible amount of pain all the time, and my work performance continued to suffer dramatically. Eventually, they let me go with a severance, but were nice enough to continue to pay for my health insurance so I could have surgery #2 (and #3). During that time I was desperate, in pain, and not thinking clearly at all. I had been taking serious pain medication for going on two years and had developed a physical dependency. So, in a moment of desperation, I looked for alternatives, which ultimately drove me to substitute cannabis for the nerve inhibitors and narcotic pain medication that I was taking. 

Around the same time, A police officer pulled me over for driving without my headlights on and asked me to submit to a sobriety test. This was when I was at my worst physically and I could barely get in and out of the car, let alone walk a line. 
As such, I was asked to submit to a blood test. In my state you can be found guilty of a dui solely on the grounds of refusing to submit to a blood or breath test because of implied consent laws. Because my state has statutes that charges cannabis offenders with the most severe DUI charges if they have any detectable amount of the substance in their system, I was charged, ultimately convicted, and went to jail. 

Now I am trying to put the pieces of my life back together. I was able to finally resolve my health issues with a 3rd surgery before I went to jail, and was able to take the time to rehab during my house arrest.  I am trying to find work again and this is already coming back to haunt me. 

I have been interviewing with a large national non-profit that offered me a position contingent upon a background screening - but just today they rescinded the offer based on the criminal background check. They have given me the option to submit in writing to them why I should still be a viable candidate, but I am crushed and don't know where to begin addressing with without sounding as if I am minimizing my actions. I know what I did was wrong. Will this haunt me forever? 

Any advice from any hiring professionals or people that have been in similar circumstances would be appreciated.

[What do you enjoy most about your job? Did you enjoy watching the Martian? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0ykj6?context=5)|What I enjoy most about my job is putting it together and seeing our work actually fly in space when we are done. That is a satisfaction in engineering to actually have tangible products at the end and we get to do it in the most challenging environment possible to the benefit of humanity. - Nujoud.
 |JC- Working with a team of NASA and industry partners to translate Mars plans into reality.  Yes, I loved watching the Martian, everytime I've seen it...
 |The opportunity to be a part of something truly historic. To know I am a part of extending human presence beyond our planet. -- andy.
 |Knowing that we are all working on the mission of a lifetime ... building the systems and teams that will one day take the first humans beyond low earth orbit, beyond the moon, eventually to Mars.  For most of us involved in the space program, working on these programs and projects are the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.  I loved the Martian!!!  It captured many aspects of a future Mars mission very accurately.
 |Darby- What's not to love about working on the rocket to Mars?! Rick- I like searching for innovative solutions to enduring problems.  The Martian - We loved it!
 |Totally enjoyed watching the film and I thought it captured the spirit of NASA in an entertaining yet informative way. Clearly communicated the ability of the team to collectively come together and solve problems that needed to be solved, no matter the challenges. Matt Damon for an Oscar. -- andy.
 |MT - Coming to work with such a capable, passionate and dedicated group of team members every day.  Plus, the ""yes, I am a rocket scientist"" line is fun to use.
 |Bill Pratt - I love physics and math!  Being able to come to work and apply that to real problems gives be great satisfaction.  Knowing that what I work will make a lasting difference is also not bad : )  Haven't seen the movie yet so no spoilers (I did read the book though, loved it)!
[Outside of funding, what do you consider to be the biggest problems facing the EM-1 launch of SLS and Orion? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0yxku?context=5)|In your question, you've hit on the biggest issue ... when managing a large, complex multi-year development program, budget and schedule are major challenges. I have complete confidence in the technical abilities of our team to meet those challenges. Appropriate testing and analysis have been completed and/or are underway to confirm we have a safe vehicle to go fly. - Andy Schorr.
 |Doing something we haven't done in 40 years - developing a human rated launch vehicle and leaving low Earth orbit. The success of the major milestone reviews show we have addressed all of the engineering challenges and are moving to production. Keep the support coming and we'll fly in 2018.  - Darby/Rick.
 |MT - Assembling and preparing space hardware for flight is tough business, especially the first time you build up a brand new vehicle.  We like to say the devil is in the details.  So getting all the interfaces and all the parts and all the systems to work flawlessly can take more time than you plan for.  This is why we carry some schedule margin to handle surprises.  So far, we are on schedule and the major technical challenges have been addressed.
[Hey NASA, I have a couple questions about the launch sequence and staging of SLS and Orion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0y4uf?context=5)|SLS will fly similar to current launch vehicles so generally the 2nd stage completes the mission. Look to see you at the Cape. - Rick and Darby.
[With both the 70T and 130T launch Systems, will the Core stage go orbital, or will the 2nd stage complete the LEO burn? Will any of the stages be reusable for future launches? What would be a mission that would realistically max out the 70Tâs and the 130Tâs performance?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0y4uf?context=5)|MT - The core stage does make orbit for both configurations but it is not sustainable and falls back to earth, partially burning up and landing in the ocean.  The 70 mT configuration does not have a true second stage, but the 105 mT and 130 mT configs will.  This second stage will be what takes us beyond low earth orbit on to places like the Moon or Mars.  None of the stages are planning on being reusable at this time.  The SLS is designed to handle the heavy Mars missions which is roughly what sized the 130mT configuration.
[Canât wait to see these things launch in person come 2017!  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0y4uf?context=5)|The core stage will re-enter earth atmosphere and burn up like the External Tank for the Space Shuttle. The Upper Stage will provide the insertion burn specific to the mission, for EM-1 it's the translunar injection. For asteroid return, the Upper Stage provides that mission specific burn. Orion is the only reusable part of the system. -- andy schorr.
[How will the astronauts be shielded from radiation while in the Mars Transit Vehicle?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0yu0a?context=5)|Bill Pratt â Radiation protection is a critical system needed for long duration deep space transit.  Many ideas exist on how to mitigate it but so far no one has been able to test them in a deep space environment.  There are two types of space radiation.  The first is created by solar particle events.  Orion is actually built to provide a safe haven in the event of one of those.  The other is whatâs called galactic cosmic rays.  Those are particles from outside the solar system that are constantly streaming in (although the earthâs magnetic field does a good job of shielding astronauts on the ISS from theseânot the case in deep space).  The ideas for mitigating that radiation type range from using recycled plastic trash, to recycling the astronautsâ solid waste.  Could be the first deep space stucco habitat in history!  (sorry, couldnât help it : ) )
[Will the martian version of Orion vary from EM-1/EM-2 Orion (I ask about communications systems, guidance systems etc.\) or would EM-1 version of Orion be ready to go to Mars?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw10fdz?context=5)|We are building Orion with the explicit capabilities to support long duration (including Mars missions) with ability to be upgraded over time for specific systems. Given budget and schedule resources it doesn't make sense to build ""everything and the kitchen sink"" on the first versions. The EM1 Orion will be the primary ""base"" vehicle design with the comm, guidance, and propulsion systems, etc. EM2 adds additional human and environmental control systems. Follow on additions will include docking systems, kits for added thermal control, or potentially other equipment such as for additional people, and specifically a comm system upgrade for long distances (as in even farther than the moon which EM1/2 will support). So the plan is to build a base vehicle design that support Mars missions now, but add on systems as future missions need. - Nujoud.
[I'm interested in doing stuff like this when I grow up- what classes should I take in high school and what major should I pursue to get a career in this field? Space travel has always been amazing to me, and I'd love to help humanity in the way that you guys are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw105v7?context=5)|My journey to the space program was enabled by my mechanical engineering degree, as I was interested in structures and propulsion systems. However, what you are most interested in is what you will most enjoy and be able to contribute as a result. While technical degrees will always have a place, it takes a family of disciplines, such as budgeting, industrial safety, human factors, etc., for mission success. - Andy Schorr.
 |Much of what we do at NASA involves engineering and science.  You should consider taking as many science and math courses as possible such as physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, algebra, trigonometry, statistics and my favorite, calculus.   These classes will help you prepare for a degree in science and/or engineering.  Internships in science and engineering are also a great way to learn more about a potential career.  Shawn, Charlie and Amber.
[What kind of fuel and how much of it will be needed to get there? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0y0vz?context=5)|MT- The type of fuel is really dependent on which part of the propulsion system you are looking at.  For example, the core stage uses liquid hydrogen and oxygen.  The boosters use solid propellant.  Solar electric propulsion systems are being strongly considered for in-space propulsion.  These systems would use Xenon.  How much fuel again depends on the type of propulsion but suffice it to say it's millions of pounds to get out of earth orbit and thousands and thousands to transit to Mars.
 |JC- Current plans include solar electric propulsion (SEP) for transporting cargo that will use xenon.  Also, will need hydrogen and oxygen and storeable propellants, like hydrazine for crew transfer.  By using SEP, you can save more than 50% of propellant mass launched.
[Comparatively speaking, how much more or less powerful is the first stage of the SLS versus the SV, the Soviet N1, or the Shuttle?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0z1nx?context=5)|Comparatively speaking, the SLS will be approximately 10% more powerful than either Shuttle or Apollo. This is primarily due to taking the proven 4-segment shuttle solid rocket motors and extending them to 5 segments to up the power from approximately 2.8 million pounds of thrust to 3.6 million. Comparisons to the Russians - do not have any information for that. - Andy Schorr.
 |MT - The SLS first is comprised of the boosters and the core stage (with the core stage continuing to burn as the second stage after booster separation).  The boosters are 25% more powerful than Shuttle and the core stage has one more SSME than the Shuttle orbiter had.  Not sure of the exact N1 total thrust level but it was comparable to Saturn V.  SLS is more capable than Saturn V.
[Given this power increase, are the burn times or staging affected, or does an increased payload make up for the gains over the SV launch vehicle? I guess what I'm asking is - where is this extra power used?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0zmb1?context=5)|MT - The staging and burn times are all specific to the SLS vehicle.  All of the extra power is either being used directly for payload gain or to place payloads into higher energy orbits.
[How many astronauts will be able to fit in Orion, and how long will it take for Orion to get to Mars, and are you considering a flyby mission (manned or unmanned\) before sending crews to the surface?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ow2is/were_engineers_working_on_the_launch_vehicle_and/cw0y8pt?context=5)|Initially, we are designing for 4 astronauts to fit in Orion with all the food, air, water, and life support needed for 21 days. Space wise, there is the potential to add 2 crew for a total of 6 if mission plans call for it in the future. A one-way trip to Mars will take around 9 months, so clearly Orion can't do this all by ourselves. Mission architectures call for additional habitat modules and equipment to support the Mars mission and the primary Orion function will be to take the crew safely to and from Earth to space. Our first mission will be to cis-lunar space unscrewed to test all the systems out in 2018, followed by a crewed flight in 2021.

I recently posted on here and /r/cscareerquestions about how I've been out of college for over a decade and have mostly been doing retail work.  I've also been on occasion trying to teach myself different things to get back into IT/CS, such as web programming, app programming, game programming, and most recently I got CCNA certified.

Someone suggested that I've spread myself out to much, and should find one thing to really become an expert in.  The problem is I'm not sure which.  I find programming interesting, and I find networking interesting.

The thing is I want to get a job in either ASAP.  I feel the more time I spend in retail the less desirable I am by any tech company.  I don't care about getting a high paying job, I want the experience.  I've tried applying to internships and co-ops but I never get responses.  Experience in any sort of IT/CS role I'm sure is much better than retail.  I've been looking in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area because I have family there, and I hear it is a great place to find this kind of job.  

I do feel like focusing would be a good idea, but I'm not sure which way to go.  I wonder if it would be easier to return to programming as I can easily just get on something like GitHub and start working on a project, or do something on my own.  I'm not sure what I can do on my own with networking other than going for more certs.

I also worry my resume is weak since most of it is about my retail jobs, which are not really relevant.  Other than that I taught myself Cisco in order to earn my CCNA, I don't think there's much I can say about it.

I see this post has become more of a wall of text than I wanted, and I feel like I repeated a lot from the original post. Thank you for making it through this.  Any advice or PMs would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Graduated almost 10 years ago; have been almost exclusively working retail; want to work in programming, networking, or help desk; which is easiest to break into and what can I do to make me more employable?"

Now, my coding skills are only junior (to the extent I've completed at uni.. so some python/java and basic hmtl/css) and I'm probably not eligible for an entry level role yet (and not an internship because my marks weren't good enough). 


As such, will it be feasible to spend a few months or so working on projects after I graduate? My only fear is that I won't be productive and I will end up wasting time. Perhaps it is better to just get a role in support or helpdesk and try to build my coding skills after work?"

I completed an internship over the summer for a startup and they gave me an offer to return after I graduate (yay!).  I expressed my wishes to join the data science team when I return (the internship was really just data analytics/analysis, but my major has really over prepared me for a role like that.  I'm also currently doing research at my uni, etc.), but they told me that they want me to return on a team closer to marketing.  A few days ago they posted on their careers page a role identical to a role that I explained to them would be my ideal role.  They also denied my request for higher pay and title of data scientist.  They would like me to be an analyst, and work with the other analysts who have no formal math background. I literally know more about programming/math/data science than the entire team put together.  

Yesterday, someone else gave me an offer.  Less pay, worse benefits, no equity, but in a data science role.

I've already accepted the first offer.  

Here are my concerns:  I'm worried that working as an ""analyst"" will hinder my chances of moving into DS successfully, especially because I'm an undergrad only.  If I come out of school as a data scientist, it looks better.  Also I believe that the first company may not have my best interests in mind, seeing as they are willing to disregard what I want and put me somewhere else.

I need some advice, thanks."

So, I'm an intern with the local county government. The IT department here consists of one dedicated helpdesk tech, two field techs, a server admin/sysop, a network admin, a database admin, the CIO, and myself.

A few weeks ago, my direct supervisor (hereafter known as Field Guru) gets a call forwarded to him from Helpdesk. Evidently, one of the county employees has lost all network connectivity for her desktop, but her phone (VoIP system) is still working. So Field Guru gets her IP (the third-party RD client we use bases connections off IP) and tries to connect remotely.

No response.

Field Guru tries to ping.

No response.

Right, so it looks like this is going to be a field call after all. We pack up and move out. Out of the building, we march. Across two city blocks, we march.

We get to the building wherein the problematic connection lies, fully prepared to deal with whatever cabling nightmares might be waiting. We proceed up the stairs (as there's no elevator).

Just as we're stepping into the office, the user says to us, ""Oh, hey. I was just about to call you.""

As it turns out, she'd accidentally kicked her desktop's Ethernet cable out of the port and had figured it out just before we arrived."

Stats:

SAT I: 2360 (800 M, 780 W and 780 R)

SAT II: Math 2 (790), Physics (750) - Math 2 was pretty bad, but I took it a long time after having finished precalculus with no preparation, and was banned from taking it again by my college counselor (he said retaking it would be like grade grubbing).

AP's: Calculus BC (5), Spanish Lang (5), US History (4), Physics 2 (4), Statistics (5), MacroEcon (5), MicroEcon (4).
EDIT: Just wanted to add that I self-studied BC and both Econ exams (not sure if this is relevant).

Senior Year Courseload: Honors English, AP Comp Sci, Non-Euclidian Geometry, AP Physics C, Astronomy, Theatrical Production: Fall.

Financial Aid: No

Income Bracket: 300,000+

Ethnicity: Indian

40 hours as an intern in Argentina's national observatory

40+ hours as an admissions officer for my HS (giving tours, working school fairs, open houses, speaking on panels,etc.)

100+ hours teaching and educating kids from slum's and villages in India

I don't even know how many hours from classmate tutoring through our school's program, elementary school tutoring, and middle school tutoring - probably north of 100 easily.

Theater (have been in multiple productions)

Admissions Officer for School

On Admissions Committee for nonprofit that supplements the education of kids with very few resources

Co-President of Debate club

Co-President of club that goes and tutors at a local middle school

Essays: Fairly personal, so I'm not going to share. 8/10 at least.

Other:

My hope, if accepted at one of these universities, would be to pursue a degree in math. While my senior year course load seems light in terms in ""hardcore"" math, that's only because I have already finished Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations (the last two were taken at UCLA, where the professor was blown away that I was only 16 when I took them, considering I was in the top 5-7 enrolled kids). I also may have repeated a couple things across categories the categories I created above - might have overdone it in an attempt to be accurate about everything.

I am a 23 year old, and I got my degree from a small school in Oregon (def not top tier by any means) with a 3.36 Major GPA, I felt like I was middle of the pack in terms of students there. I have no internship experience, the only real projects I have are my capstone project a, Java application that made calls to Tumblr API to visualize a blogs ""post"" history, checking for post type and time, and a silly snake game I worked on with an artist friend of mine(which I hesitate to put on this list as a lot of the base code for the game is already plasterd everywhere on the web). Both of the projects have fairly messy code. I mostly have worked in Java. I know moderate amounts of HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL. Taken classes with C/C++, python, php, ruby/rails, and probably some more that I can't think of at the moment. Other job experience is pretty minimal a Lifeguard gig when I was in high school and the first part of college. Then I just did odd jobs for a couple of years after that.

I would really like to get a job in Portland or at the very least in the Pacific Northwest, but I don't know if it is even possible with my resume. Everyone on this subreddit says ""APPLY APPLY APPLY"" but I'm nervous of applying to places because I feel like I don't know enough to get the job or even for companies to spend more then a second on my resume. Browsing this subreddit has made me either feel good about myself or super bad about myself(I know I shouldn't compare myself to everyone but when you're competing for jobs it's hard not to.) 

Not really sure how much of the above information is useful to my post...

tldr: I'm a recent CS graduate that often feels inadequate when comes to the tech scene. Should I be applying for jobs anyway? and if not what should I do to help my case?

3p2gzr,5,2015-10-16,TIFU by making my middle school teacher quit [xl],teachquit,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3p2gzr/tifu_by_making_my_middle_school_teacher_quit_xl/,"This memory was resurfaced by a recent post on this sub. However, unlike the other guy, I really did FU. This was my fault.

In 8th grade I had the nicest civics (American government class) teacher who had been with the school forever. She was a bit older than most staff and to be honest was probably old enough where she sometimes experienced culture shock with the students. Well, her final year of teaching, she had a 7th period class with me and my friends Brian, Ryan, Alvin, Darren, Alec, and Rick. Across the 7 of us, we were the ultimate stereotypical middle school boys, and our teacher Ms. S had the distinct displeasure of having all of us in the same class. Through the course of the school year we progressed from normal dumb middle school shit like yelling jokes in the middle of lessons, laughing uncontrollably at each other's jokes, and yelling across the room when we weren't supposed to be talking and into more progressive, experimental, new-age dumb shit. One day we convinced half the class in joining us in sitting on our desks facing the back of the room. We sat facing the wrong way silently for the entirety of the class and pretended we couldn't hear the teacher. At the time we reasoned that Ms. S was one of the nicest teachers and she never got mad at us. To our middle school minds, that didn't mean we should be nice to her, it meant that we could really push the dumb shit limit. Thirty minutes into the class, with only a few kids paying attention to her, and still over 10 of us pretending she didn't exist, she had her first breakdown. She exited the room. Nobody knew what to do - none of us had seen an adult just snap like that before. So we sat down normally, and when she came back in 5 minutes later to continue the lesson, we pretended nothing had happened.

Fast forward a few weeks, we had slowly eased back into psychologically tormenting this poor woman. Our new idea involved just the 7 of us - we got to class early, and Ms. S was out of the room so we decided to take advantage of our opportunity to stage a new prank. All 7 of us hid behind a bookshelf in the back of the room. The class started with all of us being marked absent. Ms. S commented on how strange that was then quickly moved forward with the class. Then after five minutes, with Ms. S back to the board, Brian walked out from behind the shelf to his desk and sat down. ""What? Where have you been Brian?"" ""What do you mean Ms. S? I've been here the whole time."" A few classmates who had suddenly become wise to what was going on assured Ms. S that he had definitely been there the whole time. Slowly after another five minutes, Ryan stepped out and went through the same process again. This happened a few more times. Finally it was Alec's turn. Alec didn't check to see if Ms. S was looking or not, he just stood up and strolled to the desk staring her straight in the eye. This motherfucker even whistled as he was lollygagging. Ms. S did a hard stop in the lesson and glared Alec down. She demanded an explanation with her gaze but he completely reflected it, perfectly playing the part of the oblivious student. There was no storming out by the teacher this time but I could tell in that instant her spirit had fallen another five stories.

The final joke that ended her career was Alvin's idea. We all bought water bottles during lunch and carried them with us til Civics. Sporadically throughout the class - every few minutes - one of us would purposefully knock our water bottle off our desk. We would then make a big Mr. Bean-esque display of trying to pick it back up, throwing books on the ground and knocking our chairs over all the while yelling, ""Sorry! Sorry! Oh God I'm so sorry!"" (think of the frog intern from Bojack Horseman). Almost a third of the class time was being lost to these displays. After twenty minutes, Ms. S lost it. ""ENOUGH! STOP JUST PLEASE STOP!"" 

It had been my turn and I stopped mid fumble to look up at the now delirious woman that had once been our kind heart-ed teacher. I couldn't think of anything to say or do, so I just put on my most convincing apologetic voice and said, ""Ms. S I swear I can't help it, this water bottle is just too slippery!"" and then swiped a text book off my desk. As it crashed into the floor, Ms. S burst into tears and walked out of the room.

It was the third quarter of the school year, and we never saw Ms. S again. I guess she never made a specific complaint about which students drove her to quit, because none of us ever got in trouble. We had a permanent substitute til the end of the term, and that was it. One of the innocent kids in our class asked the sub about Ms. S once, and we were informed that she started teaching adults at a local community center because she wanted more mature students.

I'm now a young 20's adult working full time at my first real job, and over a decade later I'm remembering this incident for the first time in years. I don't know why we were ever so cruel or how we were able to ignore this woman's feelings so consistently for almost a full school year, but we did. I don't now how she had it in heart to not blame us, to understand that we were immature and still young. I'll never see her again and I'm not even sure she's still alive. I feel guilty thinking about it right now, but I mean I had forgotten about it until I saw that other post so I don't really know. It's just a very absurd incident in my history and a shocking display of juvenile cruelty. Anyways, IFU

TL;DR: Heartless school children drive a grown woman into abandoning her career in a series of escalating pranks.

I'm totally new to CS up until this year, when it was a required part of my planned major. I was premed, but I'm thinking that I'll almost surely switch to CS. I'm about a year behind a lot of other students, and I don't have that codebase that some people enter college with. That said, I'm willing to work my ass off to get back on track and build the basis for a solid career in CS in the future.

My intro class is learning Java right now. What else would you recommend I learn? I was thinking HTTP/REST APIs, to help with Android applications? ([Idea came from here](https://medium.com/@qrazhan/cs-internship-recruiting-guide-aebb68912808)). Should I be applying for internships right now? I'm from Seattle and we've got a networking trip in Silicon Valley coming up which I applied for.

I've started to make a calendar/scheduling application that will record the amount of time it takes students to do X amount of pages of reading for an assignment and then guess how long other assignments will take them. It will then build their schedule of doing homework around their activities, which other people can add onto their schedules (leaders of their extracurriculars for example). This is just a project that sounded neat to me; I know some parts like other people passing stuff through the web will probably be hard (I have no knowledge of it).

I've wanted to go to University of Chicago for a long time and it is my number school one by far. It's also the most competitive I'm applying to. My essays are pretty good (I took a unique approach to the ""What paradoxes do you live with?"" prompt) and I've had my english teach working with me. Both teachers giving me letters of rec I've had for two years (English and Biology). I'm just nervous about the whole thing. Thank you!

I was thinking it would be beneficial if I were to get a dual major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I'm currently just doing computer engineering and I feel like it puts me at a disadvantage for the positions I want.

I'm looking to do embedded development for not only low-level programming but higher-level as well. Most of my work experience has been in writing drivers in C and sometimes Assembly. I recently interviewed at a big company I was really hoping to work for but they sounded disappointed in my current experience because I wasn't working with data structures or algorithms. I know how to use them but I haven't gotten to use them where I work.

I'm feeling frustrated trying to prove my abilities to program. I've recently picked up a contract gig that may be similar to what I want to do but I haven't worked out the details yet. Its too early to talk about it for any internships I may interviewing for. I'm currently a junior and this was my last summer to get internships and I feel like I can now never get the type of positions I want because the expectations are going to be even higher than they are now.

Any help or tips are greatly appreciated, Thank you.

*Graduated in May with a degree in sociology, a minor in public health, and lots of undergraduate research experience and a little job and internship experience.  I'm 25 right now and have about 8 months left that I can spend on my parents' insurance until I have to have my own.  Should I stick it out and keep trying for something I like more or do I (maybe, if I get an offer) take this soul-sucking medical document retrieval job just to get started in SOMETHING?*

*Am living with parents, no debt (very fortunate and thankful for this), and no expenses aside from gas and some food and I have a little bit of money saved for that.  A have my GREs done but think it would be smarter to get some experience and money in the bank before deciding if I'd wanna consider graduate school.  I wanna stay local to stay with my parents to stay debt-free and because my girlfriend is situated here and she's getting a nice start here already.*

FULL VERSION


I went to a good community college (in which I got very involved), earned my associate's, and then transferred to a competitive state college.  While at community college, I worked at a major retailer as a PC technician doing upgrades, repairs, and virus removals, etc.  That job gave me a good amount of useful computer knowledge but nothing in terms of coding, programming, or anything extensive.  Still, I'd say I'm a quick learner when it comes to working with computers.

Now, while at community college, I became interested in biology.  I took just about every class I would have needed for an associate's in biology but, I didn't take calc or organic chemistry so instead, I graduated with a degree in the liberal arts and figured I'd pursue my BS in biology at the four-year school.

So, I transfer to my four-year institution into the biology program because I (at this time) want to help people in my future job and think that science or medicine is the only way this goes.  I end up not liking biology without having it within the context of my previous liberal arts classwork.  I switch into the sociology program and pick up a public health minor and a concentration in health and environment.

I get involved with the environmental club on campus, get involved in research using both quantitative and qualitative research methods (SPSS, some GIS), study epidemiology, environmental sociology, U.S. public health, global public health, etc.  During this time, I start working at a health food store in a low-income, mostly black neighborhood nearby.  I had always been told that the ""ghetto"" is a scary place to avoid but quickly come in contact with super friendly, down-to-earth, good people every day at this job.  Well, being in that neighborhood but working at a health food store is a sort of a unique situation to be in as low-income, mostly black neighborhoods tend to be filled with liquor stores and fast food but, devoid of fresh healthy foods.  

While learning evaluation research in a research section with a professor I had become close with, and while studying epidemiology with another professor I became very close with, I decide to design and conduct my own senior thesis using quantitative and qualitative methods.  I wanted to find out why ""food deserts"" truly exist and my research was showing me other reasons beside purely availability, as food desert research has suggested.  I excel in my coursework, start my thesis, and become involved in some qualitative research as a partnership between my state school and a major institution in the northwest.  I become more and more interested in how one's socioeconomic status determines their health outcomes.  A year of my thesis goes by, I present my early research design at a few on-campus events, continue working at the health food store, and begin the actual research by surveying people and analyzing data in SPSS.  I continue progressing through my coursework, complete my thesis, and present it at a conference in NYC.  After this, I decide I wanted to do an internship in addition in my last semester (graduation requires either a thesis or an internship; I decided to do both).  I also considered graduate school so, I studied for and took my GREs just to have them under my belt in came I wanted to go back into academia for an advanced degree.

I intern at an ACO.  I research health legislation, homelessness, and perform telephone audits.  Now, I liked the research aspect of the internship but, it got a bit boring because I felt I wasn't contributing much (although, it was just an internship after all).  

I graduate, father has major surgery, I'm now taking care of him from June unto August.  I'm living back home with my parents.  It's a pretty good experience, honestly.  It brought us closer in some ways, as we always butted heads.  However, I put off my job search while taking care of him.  In August, I started applying to positions at the township courthouse, administrative assistant jobs, another PC technician job, a grant-writing agency - I get one interview but no hire.  I just wanted any job and felt sorta lost.  The internship kinda took the steam out of my will to continue work in this food desert/obesity/health intersection.

I decide to go back to applying for jobs that are more relevant to my research and thesis of my undergrad.  I apply for a job working a job that's a combination of health, environment, and education.  Would have been a dream job starting out.  Had a phone interview, I thought it went well.  They end up hiring someone more experienced.  I'm sad and the professor who recommended me is sad that I didn't get the job but, hey - maybe I gotta start smaller.  

I contemplate looking for work outside of my state as per advice of a career services counselor from my community college.  There is work in the ""food rescue"" and public health area up north but, I decide that living at home is the smartest decision.

I am fortunate and have ZERO debt and my parents do not charge me rent.  Although I worked all throughout college, I only have about $500 saved up because I was using my income to pay any bills I could while at school.  It would be ridiculous to move out and start paying rent and racking up debt.  Also, I have a girlfriend that I met at the four-year institution and we've become very, very close and we're thinking things are gonna be quite long term.  She's happily employed in her first year of teaching and we see each other each weekend.  Keeps me going and encouraged.  

Now, being that I was so involved in research with faculty and I've always been a good student, I decided I'd apply to a few administrative jobs at the community college I graduated from.  I like the academic atmosphere, although plenty of people do.  Haven't heard anything back yet on the most recent and other positions were filled by more experienced people.

Last week, I'm on LinkedIn and see a friend I used to work at the PC technician jobs with.  He's working at a health care cost containment company doing IT.  He tells me I should apply in either medical document retrieval or medical claims negotiation.  I look the positions up and they're not particularly appealing.  Lots of filing records and talking on the phone.  However, I want a job.  It's been 5 months since graduation and 3 since I've begun my search (that's not long but it feels like a lot because I like to stay busy, as I'm sure many of us do).

I call up and ask about the medical document retrieval and medical claims negotiation jobs.  The woman on the phone is very nice, asks me a little background, and tells me the job would likely start at $13/hour (~$25k, basic health care, 401k, PTO) in medical document retrieval and that the claims negotiation job is the job you can move up into if you do well in claims negotiation.  

I'm not thrilled but, I do really want an income and this is an opportunity.  I submit an application and have an interview next week.  My friend believes I can get the job easy but, I really think I'd be miserable doing it.  Now, if the job gives me genuinely useful experience that I can move on with, then it might be worthwhile but, I'm starting to think that the job really could be just miserable and dead-end.  However, I'm going to go to the interview to get a better idea of the job and to get the experience.

In the meanwhile, I still have this recently submitted application for a job at my community college alma mater which would involve advising and registering students and helping students transfer.  I feel this would be a really good fit or starting platform for me but, they want 3 years experience in a registrar's office so, even with my research background and computer tech background, they may want that very specific registrar's office experience.

Now, there's a job fair at my community college alma mater next week the day before my interview with the other job and I'm going to go and see if I can maybe bump into some of the faculty and staff I used to know while studying there and mention I applied for the registrar position there.

So, here I am confused because I feel I worked pretty hard to get to a good four-year school, I worked hard while at it, I have definite passions for public health and for higher education yet, I'm not quite sure what to apply for and this job that I might be able to get in medical document retrieval sounds awful.  I don't expect a big salary right out of college but, I do feel I perform better when I'm doing something I have a genuine passion for and understanding of.  I enjoy being around people and sitting in an office all day on the phone would be soul-sucking to me but, I also am not quite sure what to even look for anymore in terms of jobs to apply to.

Granted that I get the basic requirements a gpa of 3 or more/ letter of recommendations. Will I be able to pursue an MSc in computer science at Ryerson university in Canada? Also, is it worth the time that I lost to switch to Computer science and forget about computer engineering?

3p5lf9,12,2015-10-17,TIFU by going on a 'Solo Mission' in China,XiaoXiaoHei,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3p5lf9/tifu_by_going_on_a_solo_mission_in_china/,"This glorious TIFU happened a little over a year ago, during the beginning quarter of my 19th year alive. I'd been in china for around 7 weeks leading up to this FU, on an internship at a local mobile games company in the southwestern chinese metropolis of Chengdu. Many Fups Occurred during this time, but I think this is the most memorable. The day started like most others. Go to internship. Get back to the apartment. Get ready, meet the other interns and then scour the city for the free drink offerings that bars and clubs offer to attract foreigners. On this particular day it was the birthday of a canadian intern so many more people came than the usual 3 or 4.
 

The drinking began at Helen's bar, a bar full of smoke in the air with Free 500ml Tsingtao beers until 10pm. We arrived nice and early to make the most of the free beer, downing drinks as fast as socially acceptable, maybe 3 bottles in a hour, before buying strong mojitos and deciding to head off to our next favourite spot. Miu was our next spot on the list. We knew all the staff and this meant we got free vodka with some fancy watermelon juice. The mixture of both these ingredients was called the devils juice by us interns as the alcohol had the effect of suddenly hitting you after a while. 


Over the next 4 hours we Gambei'd glasses of the concoction and mingled with the locals. One by one the others gave in to the juice and headed home, leaving just 4 of us in miu. For some reason the club was empty at 2 which was odd as most days it would die down around 3 and other clubs would die after 5. After some discussing the others had decided to call it a day. Being the youngest of the interns and also the newest to drinking I naively decided I didn't need the others to have a good time.

And so I began the march of solitude to a bar I'd been to once before with my buddy, called Only. The name was fitting for my first 'Solo Mission' as I like to call them. I walked in to the club and walked straight to the bar. Now most chinese clubs won't let you order a single beer, you have to order in multiples of 6, ain't nobody got that kind of money as a student and intern, so instead I decide to order my new favorite drink. Long Island Iced Tea... Now as a novice at drinking I underestimated the 500ml-ish glass of the stuff and how much alcohol was in it. I proceed to down my first glass within a minute or two and wave the bartender over to order another.I get my second drink and down that too. At this point the bartender points at me while discussing with his colleague, both with the look of surprise on their faces. I was assuming this was them being surprised at seeing a brown guy for the first time (not very common in sichuan). So I ignored this and went to take a leak. Enroute to the toilet I say 'Ni hao' to some locals who stared at me in a curious manner, joining some for a drink on my way back.


After some time, I open my eyes to the sight of one of the rivers that dissects the city. I didn't know what had happened or how I'd got there.majorly confused, I slowly got up and went to check the time on my phone which was noticeably missing, I then go to check my watch which was also missing. I start panicking as the address to my place was on my phone. I kind of knew the subway stop but i didn't know where the closest subway station was. I then go to check my wallet so see if I had cash to get a cab to the subway...You can see where this is going...


After 20 minutes of gazing at the river and trying to piece together what had happened during the hours i'd black out. I decided to start walking in a random direction. shouldn't be hard to find the subway station i figured. Boy was I wrong. Chengdu a city the size of london with 14 million people only has 2 subway lines ~30 stations. Finding one would be like finding a needle in a haystack. I change goals and decide to talk to every person I saw. The problem was the chinese I spoke consisted of 'I like your big ass' and 'Thanks',also not many chinese people speak or understand english, so what I thought would be a simple task became a monumental headache amplified by the slow onset of my hangover. After two hours of harassing people by saying 'English?', I had finally found a english speaker who pointed me in the vague direction of the subway. After 90 long minutes of shame walking I find my apartment complex, just in time to get ready for work...


One long, unlucky night.


TLDR - Got hammered in china. Lost my stuff... and myself."
3p5m2t,1,2015-10-17,"Been reading here for months, trying to choose between startups or established companies now.",YelluhJelluh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3p5m2t/been_reading_here_for_months_trying_to_choose/,"Hey everyone,  
  
I've been reading through this sub for quite a few months now and it has always been a great source of 'insider info' about what it's really like to work at different types of companies in the industry.  
It seems that many people who end up at established companies don't really get to work on projects where they're implementing new stuff a user will actually interact with (or if they work back end, that a user would use unknowingly even). Many people here complain about not being able to make new stuff, or touch existing front end stuff if they work at established companies (i.e. Microsoft).  
  
On the other hand, there are startups - TONS of room for nothing but development that will actually be used by the masses! But it's inherently more risky to work for a startup.  
  
I'm only a sophomore in college, so I have plenty of time to get internships and make my choice, I'd just like to see a discussion of the actual differences between startups and established companies when it comes to implementing 'new' code instead of updating existing code, which is not something I see myself being interested in. Which environment would I be most satisfied with if I want to make new interfaces, new content, that kind of stuff?  
Personally, my dream is to work at Google, so I'm not too sure if I'd ever be able to push something out that they'd want millions/billions of people to be able to see. But that'd certainly appeal to me more than updating stuff.  
  
Thanks in advance."
3p5muk,2,2015-10-17,I took a job six months ago and didn't realize I was being underpaid until now.

It is a junior web developer job that pays $35k annually in a Midwest city. Now I came to realize after reading this sub, and going to Indeed for jobs for the first time, that I am getting paid under average in the city. I should be getting at least $50-60k.

The reason I didn't know about this beforehand is that I graduated with a New Media degree, don't have any proper CS connections, and because I live with my family (and also during the entire time I was in college), I was complacent with a $35k salary and started saving up a lot of money to get ready to move out. I didn't take any internships. Before this job my highest paying job was $12 an hour. But it looks like I need more if I want to comfortably live in my own apartment.

Did I set myself up for more difficult salary climb? I do not want to state my current salary but I don't know why some recruiters think it's so important (for me, anyways). Can I afford to be as selective as people who got paid $60k on their first developer job?"

That out of the way, I have some questions (judge me later):

1. How much of a ""college town"" is Orlando (specifically the area around UCF)? Are the bars live every weekend? Clubs? Can I bar hop reliably? Are there shuttles for drunk people?

2. I've heard that it's hard NOT to find a house party, especially if you live off but near campus. How accurate is this? If you have no plans and you just walk out of your apartment can you expect to find parties?

3. How are the tailgates?

3. How is the Information Technology/Computer Science program? Internship opportunities?

I didn't know what DevOps was before I started, but I was hungry for any kind of experience I could get. It's been a mixed experience for me. Some of the work (namely, the more operations side of things) I cannot stand, but I have enjoyed wiring up automation (with Bash, Ruby, Puppet, etc.), tinkering with tooling and processes, and experimenting with tech like Docker. 

My boss recently offered me a full time position, essentially doing what I'm doing now but with a much better paycheck. The company is also just about to start a whole lot of AWS work, and I would be heavily involved with that going forward. This would be my first job in the industry and I think it's a great opportunity for me.

That said, I'm also of two minds about it. I consider myself a developer first and foremost, and scripting just doesn't fully scratch that itch (although I do keep myself occupied in that area in my own time). I'm worried that I'll be stuck in DevOps for the rest of my career without more ""real"" development experience - and I definitely don't want that!

How difficult do you think it would be for someone with DevOps experience to transition into a more fully Software Development role? Not necessarily within the same company (although there are some opportunities like that within mine), but also when applying for other jobs in the future, etc."

I've watched my program evaluation like a hawk as I've went along to make sure I'm taking appropriate classes as well as to just stay informed. But after meeting with my adviser and department head because I needed waivers to take a class without the prerequisite since I have all my general education courses knocked out, they found a major issue with my projected course load. 

I've consistently taken 16-18 credit hours a semester so if I don't add one more class onto it the next three semesters I wouldn't be full time for my very last semester and I'd be graduating later than I should be. I know for a fact that I can take one extra course with ease because I'm smart enough to learn as I go so that's not my issue.

My issue arises by the fact that last week we had an Epic recruiter in our math and business department talking to the soon to be graduates from the business school and any CS student he found. He was super nice and from the sounds of it they have a nice campus and wanted interns, but I'm under qualified as of now. Next semester I'll be taking data systems, database administration, and intro to C++. Should I meet with my career services office and fix a resume and get in touch with him about an internship next summer or just hope I can land a job after graduation without one?

He didn't tell us any deadlines about applying so I think I may still have time. I only have very basic python knowledge as of now so I don't even know how I'd begin to make a resume right now. I'd love any tips on that one from you all since most of you work in this field.

I'm beyond glad that I can graduate sooner than expected but now I'm panicking about what to do about experience and jobs. My CS department has wonderful staff but unfortunately we're a liberal arts school so we don't have the same resources and assistance as other majors, which is why I'm turning to you all instead of them right off the bat.

I attended UC Berkeley studying CS for 1.5 years until I got really sick due to a pretty bad infection. Being too worried about my health I forgot about getting my grades cleared for the semester I was out being sick and received an F and an NP. I ended up completely withdrawing from the university after that, but those grades are still there on my record. 

Now like most of you know, a degree is pretty important in being able to get a job/internship in software engineering due to HR filters. I thought I could just ""start over"" and just apply as a freshman to a less selective university with my high school transcript and other test scores. It turns out universities use a background-checking tool for previous school attendance to prevent such a thing from happening. 

So right now, I'm pretty frustrated. I can't really destroy Berkeley from my records or even get an internship. (I've applied to quite a lot..looks like most companies want students). I'm not sure what to do. Any help would be awesome. "
3p6vxl,10,2015-10-17,Moving From 8 to 32-bit... Advice?,odougs,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/3p6vxl/moving_from_8_to_32bit_advice/,"Hello,

I've done a decent amount of experimentation (and a few simple projects) with AVRs. I am pretty comfortable with programming them in C and assembly, using interrupts, reading the datasheet and writing my own drivers, and working with my toolchain (GCC, Make, Binutils). 

I have a Tiva C board (Connected Launchpad) which I've done a few very simple things with (blinky, UART echo, etc), and I'm comfortable with the toolchain and debugger as well.

Now I want to get serious about working with the Tiva C board, but it ARM Cortex-M4 seems like a whole different game from AVR, and I'm not sure what the most productive way to approach it is...

* Should I learn ARM assembly, and study the architecture in depth? Or just stick with C for now?

* Should I use driverlib (and other libraries) and focus on getting projects done? Or should I use the datasheet and header files to write all of my own drivers (program registers directly)? 

* Should I try and learn an RTOS? Write my own simple scheduler? Or neither?

In the long term I'd like to do all of the above, but as an ECE student, time is limited - and I'd like to do whatever is most helpful towards getting an internship and job in firmware development in the next few years.

Thanks!"

My question is, as someone who does not know much CS/Programming, is it still possible to land an internship? I know java pretty well and I am currently learning Python and HTML/CSS through Codecademy, and intend on learning about/practicing algorithms on Topcoder after I am done learning these languages (I don't take my first algorithms class until next semester so I'm trying to get a head start). As far as personal projects, the only projects I have under my belt are the projects done in my AP Computer Science class in high school. The only other thing I can think of to put on my resume is that I have published several decent-selling books on Amazon, but clearly this isn't even CS related.

3p9gqb,4,2015-10-18,Got an idea? - How to Start a Hardware Start-up,FITGuard,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3p9gqb/got_an_idea_how_to_start_a_hardware_startup/,"Hello,

As the founder of a [hardware start-up](www.fitguard.me) I am constantly contact by people who have an idea/concept/device/product/solution that they think they want to make. Therefore, I am creating this post to explain what has helped for me, what one might need, and how it might be accomplished. This is specifically for the US.

**What you need in your Company:**

**Tangible Business Model Canvas**: This should be the first thing you do, this is your roadmap for success. It should be constantly visible and constantly updated with your progress. It is a dynamic, visual representation, of what you have and where you need to be. I am not going to get into how or why it is important, as there are plenty of talks about it. (Also don't pay for this, grab some post-it notes and draw you own.) I highly recommend you do not have a virtual BMC, see: http://www.alexandercowan.com/business-model-canvas-templates/

**Co-founder / Team:** You cannot do this on your own, regardless of how smart, how well connected, how diligent, this isn't feasible. However, you don't need to split something 50/50. Personally, I know people who have as much as 90% and each other co-founder has 5%. The important part is that they have long term vested interest and derisk the start-up from being so heavily reliant on a single individual. 
It should be noted that co-founders should have a different background than yourself, this helps diversify the team's knowledge base. 

**Electrical Engineer**: This individual needs to be sufficiently competent to develop schematics, design, layout PCB, communicate with a contract manufacturer, and handle producing PCB prototypes. Don't expect this individual to be an expert in all areas. He may not know inductive charging, or the ideal chemical composition for battery, however, he needs to be able to talk the talk and find out who can. There is nothing wrong with your EE contracting our specific EE work to someone who has a better core-competency than they do. You as the non-technical co-founder should not be that person. 

**Embedded System Engineer**: This person should be able to code firmware, develop algorithm, RF, NFC, Wifi, System architect dev, Bluetooth Stack, and is the bridge between your Mobile app dev and your EE. This position can be split between your EE and Mobile guy if they are sufficiently able to do so, but often times that is not the case. 

**Mobile Application Developer**: These guys are CONSTANTLY asked to ""work for free"" or ""work for equity"" so be sure that you do NOT make that proposition. I would recommend asking for their hourly wage, ask if they will take a 20% reduction in exchange for a finite amount of equity. For us, we gave our Mobile developer 2% of the company and he charges us $80/hr instead of $100/hr. Again this may not work for everyone, but it is what worked for us. Alternatively, you can just pay them out right for their work, however, they do not have long-term vested interest in the company. You're just another project, in my personal experience if they don't care about the long term vision of the project then they don't always produce the best work for the price. 

**Industrial Designer**: Depending on the complexity of your product you are going to have to decide if bringing this individual on as co-founder is worth it. Frankly, good design is undervalued, people tend to think they don't need a designer or should follow design principles, but having the foresight to see things through a designers-eye could save a lot of money down the road. 

**CEO/MBA/ Business Extrovert**: This is your schmoozer, your extrovert, your cheerleader, fund-raiser, networker, sales, and company face. Do you NEED an MBA? No. But this individual should be able to create a professional budget, manage a supply-chain, optimize procurement, shipping/logistics, fund-raise, pitch, sale, network, and manage the project with all of its intricacies. This person should ideally be in the co-founder category. 

**Industry Expert**: This should be your PhD, guru, subject matter expert, or executive. They can be a mentor, advisor, board member, or equity holding consultant. No matter what you are making there is someone smarter than you who can help. Don't be afraid to find an expert and bring him on board. 


**ESOP** An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is an employee-owner program that provides a company's workforce with an ownership interest in the company. Consider taking 10% of your company and giving it away to your first 5-10 employees. Mentally, it allows you to budget how much of the company you retain and how much you have put aside for investment and or employees. This is different than the equity you give to your co-founders.

**What you need FOR your Company:**

**Contract Manufacturer** Form this partnership early. Bring them in the loop, get them engaged, have them evaluate their project and explain the value they can provide. We use Jabil: http://www.blueskycenter.com/

**Local Distributors Account Manger/FAE**: Arrow and Avnet are the two big distys. They can provide sample parts, make recommendations, and often act as the liaison between the OEM and the customer. Leverage all the value they can provide. If you are unsure what LED to use, but you know you need one with specific parameters, you should be off-loading that work to you Account Manger, that is what they are therefore.

**PR/Marketing/Social Media/ Community Outreach** this is especially important if you are crowdfunding. You don't want your EE spending his time answer customer emails about ship-dates. This can be easily outsourced, or even more easily done by a recent college grad. Offer an internship program, pay them $10-15/hr and let them do their thing. Give them direction and independence. Consider them as possible future hires. 

**A Community** It is never too early to start building a community. This is the best way to receive quick feedback, build brand ambassadors, and find out who is going to be the most passionate about your product. Community is the best way to understand what problem your customers are facing. 


**Email List**Want to know how to raise a 7-figure crowdfunding campaign? You are going to need 5k plus emails. Put an email opt-in somewhere easily seen on your homepage. This can be down in less than a 30 mins. I would highly recommend as soon as possible you set up a landing page with an email opt to start generating your email list as soon as possible. 

**Other things that need to be consider**

**Patents/ Intellectual Property**: Don't over value the protection of your patent, chances are it isn't that strong and it takes way too long to wait and around and see if it will be issued. You should spend a diligent amount of time in this, but don't act like this will protect you from everything. If someone does infringe you have to pay to stop them.
 
**Accelerator/Incubator Programs:** Don't underestimate the value of being surrounded by other like-minded individuals. It isn't about the $x for y%, it's about spending 12 weeks with other entrepreneurs. Just like business school, you don't go for the curriculum you go for the networking. 

**Social Media** I would not recommend spending ANY money on this until you have a Minimum Viable Prototype. Don't hire a PR firm, don't pay for a ""growth hacker"", don't run FB ads, spend your money on creating your product, all of that stuff can be saved for a later date, your main focus should be on building what you set out to build.  

**Money**: You're going to need money, and you're going to need a good amount of it. Hardware start-ups don't come cheap, it is expensive to make prototype, and there are a lot of expensive task at hand. I would recommend you apply to start-competitions, student grants, and raise money from friends and family before looking for an angel. VC's don't invest in early age start up and you look silly when you say you need ""VC $"" Unless you are raising 7 figures, you're not raising VC money.


**In Conculsion**
This is by no means a fully comprehensive list, just enough to get the creative juices going. My personal email is Anthony@fitguard.me if you have any specific questions or want to discuss any of the topics I wrote about above. I am not selling anything I don't ""consult"" for cash. I just wanted to give back to someone who might be looking for some guidance. 


Cheers!

I didn't think that was terrible but I guess I'm obviously biased.

So was Zappos looking for straight 100% for an internship? I read somewhere on here that they only take 1 person per internship slot but that's pretty surprising and I didn't know if that was true.

I have a per diem offer right away from a place that I interned at last year. I enjoyed my internship there quite a bit. It's a much smaller company with much better management. They didn't have an opening at the time so I moved on and found a full time job else where with a bigger, more reputable, company. 

I was SUPER excited about the full time job. But unfortnately the reality isn't quite as rosy. The bigger company has terrible managment. Their scale of work is immense; it's an incredible place to learn, but an awful place to have a career. There's an awful lot of friction between departments and plenty of politics simply due to the number of employees and departments.

There is a VERY high chance that the per diem job will transition into a full time job EVENTUALLY. 

I feel guity leaving the job at the reputable place only after three months. It's one of those companies that everyone wants to get in to. I was ecstatic when I was offered the job! Though it is not at all what I had in mind.

Salary wise; the bigger company pays $18.50/hr, with 3% raise every three months (it will eventually go up to $22.50 maximum), full health coverage, and 403(b) plan. 

The per diem job pays $22.50/hr but no benefits or anythhing else. The full time position will start at $22.50/hr, full health coverage, 403(b) plan, and also a 3% raise every three months. Pretty similar, that's IF I get the full time position eventually.

I want to quit this job, get the per diem position, go back to the staffing agency for more regular hours of work.

Please chime in. Any opinions or critiques will be welcomed."

EM = Engineering Manager

EM: ""My computer is still being so slow! Can I please get more RAM? I have to be able to run these simulations.""

Me: ""You have 32GB of 2133mhz RAM, and there isn't a lot more we can do to upgrade you. Have you rebooted the machine recently?""

EM: ""Yes, and I rebooted it last week when I complained to $otherguyinIT. I don't know why you keep telling me to restart, it never fixes anything. I'm about to go into a meeting, can you just come fix it?""

So I walk over to the computer. Ctrl+shift+escape to pull up task manager, go to performance tab... 45 days of uptime (31.8 GB of RAM in use. ~22 autocad drawings open, three VMs running). Restarted it and walked away.

I've always liked programming, but the harder and harder it gets, the less I find myself liking it and the more I find myself just trying to get through it. However, my 1st year at UIC, I got a student technician job at the UIC College of Pharmacy IT Unit. I thought that it was just going to be a job just to get me by during college, but it has quickly become more than that; I've discovered that I'm really good at it. Under the guidance of my great supervisor and director (who for some reason seems to have a particular liking in nurturing my skillset) I quickly rose to my current position as senior technician. Not only that, but starting in my second year, I was given duties really beyond the scope of the job of a student technician. This included configuring group policies, having volume software serial numbers in my hands, and in general being given much more responsibility. I feel like a know a good chunk of Active Directory as a result. This past summer, I actually was recommended to an internship by my Director at another college, but I was the only student there. There I learned quite a bit about SCCM and managing machines using that software. I'm still currently there because they wanted to keep me on, and as a result, I have begun learning the basics of absolute manage, a management suite for macs as well. I consider myself technically proficient in both Windows and OSX, as I even invested in an Macbook Air a year ago simply to get over being OSX phobic. Over the past year or so now, I've even been given the green light to start developing GP's from scratch and been given straight up management duties such as task delegation and shift scheduling. All of the above, plus the fact that I genuinely love what I do leads me to believe that perhaps my career might just be better suited in IT. Yes I know the pay is less in the IT field. I also want to finish my CS degree regardless. My question is, to advance myself in the eyes of the IT industry, what are some certifications that I should be investing in?

I attempted to explain an optimal solution. He couldn't understand/didn't believe it, and was adamant on a less optimal approach and dismissive of mine. Spent the rest of the interview attempting to explain the optimal approach, ultimately failed and was rejected. Should I email the recruiter and inform them? See bottom of post for the question.**

This is probably more of a rant than anything else.

I had a recent interview for an internship at a decently funded (but small - ~100 people) startup that seems to have promise. I had a final round phone interview. My interviewer asked several technical live-coding questions.

The last question was one I'd heard before so I told him I'd heard it before. He said that's OK, and to try it anyway. I began explaining several approaches, one of which was the optimal one. He basically rejected the optimal solution and was completely confused/unable to understand me when I attempted to explain it. I spent the next ~30 minutes attempting to explain it to him (with comments/diagrams in the coderpad as well), but it seemed to me he was adamant on a less optimal solution because he didn't believe my solution and was unwilling to entertain it. Ultimately, we ran out of time and I was just told to implement the most naive solution possible.

To be fair, the optimal solution is a little bit obscure and I only know it because I've studied the shit out of interview questions for the past 2 years. I think it's pretty embarrassing for an interviewer to not even know the optimal solution to his own interview question, and even more embarrassing that he was unwilling to listen to/very dismissive of a potential candidate's explanation.

I want to email the recruiter to let them know this is happening with one of their interviewers, but that might be overstepping my bounds. Also, after the interview, I accepted an offer at a top 4 company because I wouldn't work at this company anyway due to the way this interviewer acted.

So, what should I do? Should I email the recruiter and inform them? If so, what should I say? (Also, if people are interested I'll post the interview question)

Here's the question: ""Sampling from an arbitrary discrete distribution"" (with preprocessing): http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/26858/how-to-generate-numbers-based-on-an-arbitrary-discrete-distribution

Note that the accepted solution there isn't the optimal one! The optimal one is O(n) preprocessing time with O(1) sampling time (the 2nd top answer in the stackexchange question), as opposed to the O(nlogn) preprocessing and O(logn) sampling time for the binary search approach (the one my interviewer was advocating). The optimal solution is called the ""Alias method"" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method and http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/08/lab-notes-the-a.html for writeups."

I've been a member of this sub for over 3 years. Many of us focus quite hard on obtaining *the job*. The job that will pull you out of whatever situation you are in now. It's the light at the end of the tunnel that we fantasize about. 

Well, I ended up getting *the job*, and I felt that I should share my experience.  

I went to a standard state school in a non-techhub area. It's a school that you would know of if you lived in the region, but nothing known nationally. 

I worked my ass off. I didn't even have prior coding experience coming in to university, but practiced and practiced, until I landed at a lowly dev intern position paying ~10/hr. I tried to take ownership of anything that I could, putting in overtime (luckily paid), and sacrificing most of my free time. I slowly climbed positions/companies while in school and by the time I graduated, I was lead of a small division at a local startup pushing real products to real customers and making 60k+. Before graduation, I didn't even have to apply anywhere, recruiters reached out to *me*. I studied enough to blow through (most) interviews and ended up having several offers in hand before needing to decide. 

I graduated in under 4 years (at age 21) and worked around 35 hours a week the entire time in school. Now I work for one of the Big 4 in the Pacific NW on the core of their biggest service. I am the only member of my team with a bachelors, most having a PhD, and I came in with an outstanding offer, roughly 140k/year (base+bonuses). 

Awesome, right? This is what many of you strive for in this sub, at least, I know I strived for this. But the truth is that I'm not happy. I strived for where I am at now because I wasn't happy where I was. But getting a high paying job and moving across the country didn't solve my unhappiness. And now, I feel that I wasted the crucial social time that you get when in college. I truly regret how much time I spent working instead of meeting and connecting with people, and now in a new city, it is *hard* to really meet new people that you can truly connect with. 

You can get to the goal/job/dream of your choice, but just be aware that you are sacrificing. It may not be readily apparent to you now, but everything comes with a trade-off.

3pec4q,1,2015-10-19,Questions about email forwarding project??,YungKob,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/3pec4q/questions_about_email_forwarding_project/,"Hey all, a bit of background first: I am a junior CS student and I have an internship for a company that supplies most of the internet to public facilities/all schools in my state. 

I was just handed a project to finish by myself. By having so many customers across a broad area, we frequently receive (maybe 10-15 a day) copyright infringement notices from studios like Paramount and Columbia. These notices are long, mostly redundant information. The key piece of data provided in these notices are obviously the violators IP address.

Right now, to respond to these notices, I must first manually lookup this IP address in one database to determine who the owner of that IP address is within our domain. For example: ""abc.de.fgh"" IP is owned by Faketown High School. Unfortunately, this first DB only contains our owned IPs and customer names. I must use that name and then go into *another* DB to determine who the Primary Tech contact for that location is. Then I need to go back into my mail client, copy over the necessary email addresses and forward them the Copyright infringement notice along with a generic message coming from our side urging them to take action before further more disciplinary action will be taken. 

We want to automate this entire process. Now I have a moderately good understanding of some programming languages, but I just wanted to reach out to this community to see what the best, most efficient way to solve this relatively easy project would be.

I have not had much experience with scripting languages like Python, but that was my first plan since using anything like Java or C++ would be redundant. I started looking through the APIs of our DB providers (They're both small and less-popular so I am trying to get familiar with them....how I wish it was MySQL :/).

All Im asking is for somebody to point me in the right direction and maybe provide a ""blueprint"" as to how you think this would work. I imagine that I will use SQL in combination with a scripting language such as Python to first search for the IP in DB1, relay that info and use more SQL commands to search for it in DB2 at which point the contacts *should* be extracted from. Then all that is left to do is automatic email forwarding, which I am totally unaware of how to do but I'm sure is not that tough of a challenge.

Let me know, and than you in advance to everyone!!

The interviewer only asked a few programming questions but they were all difficult to me. The sad thing is that I completed similar projects in the past- 1 of which is on my resume. However their implementations required extra stuff and it threw me off completely. 


That, coupled with the fact that I only had a certain amount of time for each question, really just messed me up. 


The person interviewing me was nice and said they'll call me about my results but I already know how its going to end up. I had to psuedocode everything and all my methods were extremely inefficient. In my head I was thinking of a recursive definition but I just couldn't come up with anything to simplify it. 



I explained all my logic and I feel strongly that my logic works- but that doesn't help the fact that my code is absolute fucking shit. I'm embarrassed to have even presented that to a company interested in hiring me. 


I have no idea what to do anymore. This was a company I really wanted to intern for and it's not a bigname company. No big 4 or anything. Just a mid-sized company whose interview I bombed. I took so much time preparing for all the interviews for this company that I'm behind in schoolwork. I failed my last programming project and feel like my gpa will drop. At the cost of what? Failing an interview process?



I dont know what companies to look at applying to after I get rejected. If I can't pass a smaller companies interview test then how will I be able to apply to bigger companies? But then again lots of smaller companies look for juniors or other experienced folk. 




I've been doubting my major since I started as a cs major freshman year but I've never felt so defeated before. I'm retarded when it comes to programming. Is there anything I can do to redeem myself? I tried preparing with hackerrank and the interview book everyone recommends but it didn't help me from failing. And obviously I didn't have enough time to go through the entire site or entire book before my technical interview.

What do you guys think? Apply regardless of my next-to-none programming skills or just don't bother and wait until next year?

Also, I was curious, how much training do you get at an internship. Do they just say ""Do this!"" and you do it, or do they teach you for the most part? I'm a very solid and quick learner. Always got great grades, I just happened to finish all of my liberal studies before deciding I wanted to be a CS major so I guess I am little behind in terms of actual CS courses."

I'm a student and I'm in need of a new computer. I like to think I'm fairly savvy, although hardware is not my strong suit. The market is killing me at the moment because from what I can see, any computer I find either has one or another feature I need and then cuts a huge corner on the next. It only seems to get better with an outrageous price tag. I'm hoping you folks can help me reach a reasonable compromise.

I'm currently using an Acer (I know...) 571G with an i7QM, GT640M and 4GB of DDR3 RAM. These specs sound great on paper, but the screen, keyboard and general build quality are revolting and it also overheats like a son of a... well anyway, I feel it's on it's last legs.

Here goes,

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: Denmark (Romania possible, but not preferred)

* Budget range: Up to, but hopefully less than 550 Euro, I'm looking at a maximum of 4000 DKK. I would take the dirt-cheapest one which fits the requirements. Money doesn't come easy.

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): It will be used for web development stuff at the moment and I plan on learning more C# or something fresh. General web browsing, running LAMPP and watching cat videos. I tend to have many tabs open so there goes the CPU. Portability is important because this Acer is breaking my back 2.5 hours a day during my commute, if you count accessories.

* Screen size preference: 14"" is ideal. Anything less is too small and 15.6 in my budget range is the same resolution on a crappier, but larger screen. Just like my Acer.

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Linux

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): None
* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Just general IDEs and running LAMP. Nothing fancy.

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): It gets tossed in the backpack (got a slot for it, but it isn't padded) then I work at a desk. It's main purpose is to be portable because I'm an intern at the moment.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I would like to avoid Acer, but I'll take it if I must. I bought a 13.3"" model for someone and it was pretty nice for the price. ThinkPads are pretty great and I have a thing for Asus as well, but I would take anything because budget.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): What I like is out of budget. Some type of alloy casing or tough matte plastic would be nice and a 1080p matte screen. 

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Performance is most important considering there isn't much of it at this price point. Low weight comes second. 

* Build quality -vs- Low price: I really need a balance of both, otherwise it's money out the window either way. I'm willing to accept compromise.

**List any critical features:**

Decent build quality is important. If it takes a couple seconds more to do the work, so be it. I hate the bendy, glossy plastics in my current notebook. I would love if it would stay cool. Acer catches on fire while idling (it's clean).

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): Definitely heat (and by default noise) are something I'd pay a bit more for. I think all my other requirements reflect on this as well. Second would be build quality. Third is the keyboard.


I know I'm asking for a miracle, but who knows?

I am also going to school full-time for computer science. I am in the process of applying for internships for next summer, and I honestly think I have a realistic shot at getting a great software engineering internship. I will graduate in Spring 2017.

The lead programmer just quit, and they extended an offer for me to take over. The group is receiving funding very quickly and is clearly on the upward spiral. I would start at $50,000/year with benefits and everything, however they want me to move there to do it. I would have to finish my bachelor's at a local tech institute, and I would probably be going to school part-time. 

Seeing as how the funding is going up, I could be making around $100,000/year within 6-10 months, and this is in an area where the cost of living is very, very low. 

Should I take the offer, move two states for the job, and delay my schooling by at least a year? Or is this Lead Programmer position not worth it - should I do a software engineering internship next summer and graduate at my expected graduate date?

I'm a junior CS student, and I've never had an interview for an internship before now. Tomorrow I have a phone interview set up with an HR rep from a small company for a 15min ""chat"". What kind of questions should I expect from this call? Will they be drilling me with questions like ""What's your biggest strength"" and that type of thing? The length makes me think that there won't be a technical portion to the call, but since I've never done this kind of thing I'm not sure what to prepare for. Thanks for any insight you all can provide. "

I feel that I have a good resume: I go to a top 10 cs school (Texas) and have had 2 previous internships(at a fortune 500 company and a start-up where I worked with Apache Spark). I also have an interesting [side](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/309ttp/how_would_you_guys_feel_about_an_appwebsite/) project that I told many recruiters about.  I was just wondering if y'all had any advice for me on what else to do. I have submitted a few online applications but I have not heard back from any of the companies. Do y'all know of companies that actually look at their online applications, I have submitted dozens of them previously and have never received a response.

I only received two interviews so far (and sadly I bombed both of them, but that's my own fault). And I'm just wondering why I'm not getting any response from other companies.

I have been to the Google seminar at my school and have asked what I should have on my resume. They mentioned previous internships, personal projects and any published apps, all of which I have. My GPA is pretty high as well. But I still didn't receive any reply.

So my question is, what exactly do I need to do? I've heard some people mention that I should post my code on Github, but what should I post? School projects? Also how do I better prepare for technical interviews? I don't usually have nerve problems with interviews, but recently I've been panicking quite a bit.

And finally, how can I improve my technical skills? The most recent technical interview I did had me stomped (I'm not a bad programmer by any means, but I was completely stuck). Some friends have mentioned codingame and so on. Are there any resources on how to become a better software engineer?

And just to clarify, I'm not asking for tips on resume / internships specifically. Just asking how to overcome this block.

-Attended a non-target in the US in a big city with a low GPA (3.16) with a BSc in Finance
-3 years of FP&amp;A experience, a.k.a. not relevant
-no relevant internships during my time at school

I took an opportunity at a tech startup based in Hong Kong that's launching an app in India, for India. Anyways, I was fortunate enough to come in at the end of the startup's seed funding and at the simultaneous middle of what they called their Pre-Series A funding. They say Pre-Series A because they got a VC fund to come in at the end of their seed round, the fund fell in love with the idea, and closed the funding deal with them. At the moment we are putting a halt on the funding and are focusing on product launch which happens in several weeks. After launch, the plan is to open up the next fundraising stage (which I hope I'm still here for), which is what they will call their Series A round.

Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is based on what I've told you, will any VC fund look at this experience as positive, with me being on the other end of it? Do I stand any sort of a chance?"
3pi9fb,3,2015-10-20,Should I keep pursuing Film Production or switch to Computer Science?,thatfatdood,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3pi9fb/should_i_keep_pursuing_film_production_or_switch/,"I'm a third-year film student at a really great university, but I'm seriously considering changing my career path.

I've been into videomaking since middle school, and all throughout high school I made lots of cool stuff and decided to study Film in college.

But I've always had a dilemma between pursuing film or computers. I have loved computing since even before filmmaking, and I built my first computer when I was in 7th grade. I built several more computers for family members, and I really got into fixing Apple products.

In high school I created a business with a friend where I'd fix broken electronics. I loved it at first, but then the business failed terribly because I kept breaking components by mistake and my friend kept wasting the company money. So that failure left such a bad taste in my mouth that I decided to pursue filmmaking instead.

But once I started studying film I felt unfulfilled, in a way. I wanted to be more challenged academically and take more math and science courses. I felt fulfilled creatively, especially once I started getting into animation, but I still felt like I was capable of more. I am now doing a videographer internship for a non-profit organization. It's all right, but I feel very limited because I'm making all their videos by myself, and I really prefer to work with a team of people.

So this internship is my only real professional filmmaking experience, and it's been meh. I don't know if I would have an entirely different experience working at some sort of production house.

I then decided to try out programming and minored in Computer Science. I absolutely loved every minute of it, and I'm attempting a double major, but because I'm at a public institution and the program is incredibly competitive, it's highly unlikely that they will admit me. I need to submit an appeal because I have too many film hours.

So I'm applying to double major next semester, but if I don't get in I will still graduate with a major in Film and minor in Computing (and though it's a minor, it's an extremely rigorous programming program).

So I'm really unsure if I should just graduate and try to look for production jobs, or I should go get my master's in CS or get my Bachelor's in CS at another school.

I'm afraid that I'll decide to pursue CS and then I'll feel creatively unfulfilled and I'll hate it. I love it now with these programming classes, but maybe I'll get tired of it. 

I love both subjects, but I feel that there are so many more jobs for CS graduates, and I'll still be able to make music videos and films even if I'm a software engineer.

**TL; DR: Currently studying Film Production and considering switching to Computer Science, but I fear that maybe I should stay in Film because I have so much experience and have invested in it so much and I still enjoy it, but at the same time I feel like I'm capable of so much more and a CS job will provide more job stability and could allow me to integrate my film knowledge and take it to the next level.**

Anyone been in a similar situation, where they are deciding between an artistic and technical career? 

Thanks for your input!"

I have gotten rusty in programming so I wanted to reach out to you guys, i have basic knowledge in VB.Net, Java, C++, PHP, HTML and CSS. 


My plan was to have at least 3 text boxes with labels as ""Time In"", ""Time Out"" and ""Total Hours"". But upon reading dates and time in VB it seems kinda tricky on how I would input and store it. I can probably code the process of computing the total and the over time but what method should I go about the storage and input of dates and time. I hope you could point me in the right direction and if you have suggestions on writing this program on another language it would also be helpful.

I'm only a few classes from graduating and I wanted to be more prepared for the job market. I landed a paid internship at a globally recognized company (not big four but still good), and spent the Summer on a small team hacking together a sweet IoT/connected device app. It was hard but rewarding and I really enjoyed the work, so I asked about post-Summer opportunities and ended up getting assigned to a more traditional product team for the Fall and possibly longer. Four weeks in and all I'm doing is front-end bug fixing on a monolithic, horribly designed internal web app. The pay is good but I'm starting to despise the work, and even though I'm an intern I'm basically treated like a contractor without any sort of support or mentorship. It's a completely different dynamic trying to understand what someone else wrote years ago versus creating my own feature, especially when no one is interested in checking in with me, working with me, or answering my questions. The worst part is that now I feel stuck because I only felt comfortable taking one class while working full time, and just found out the hard way that financial aid doesn't cover anything less than half time, and now I owe my school close to $3000. I feel like I should have just taken Fall off from working and knocked out my last 3 classes all at once while focusing on personal projects. This is basically an opportunity for me to vent but if you have any advice on what I could do to better my situation, I would much appreciate it. I'm aware this may be better suited for r/jobs, but I could also use advice on how to approach my manager and teammates in the context of a software company.

I've been programming for about 6 months, and I began to take some classes at a local community college.  I was pretty unaware to the situation, but mid-semester in a 100 level Java class my professor has recommended me to an internship.  The internship is with a massive corporation (won't disclose which) but the professor found my work to be worthwhile enough to suggest me.  I attended a minor ""interview"" with the director of the internship, but he has essentially said the job is mine by recommendation alone.  The money is good, the job sounds like a few rounds of intense coding boot camps followed by several projects tbt by the interns and guided by the director.  I've checked out the internship and found it on the college website...but I'm a skeptical person. 

The job is great money, and it sounds like I'll be doing some REALLY interesting work.  However, it sounds too good to be true.  I'm not being hired directly by the corporation.  I'm being hired for (up to, he said it is my choice of my hours) 40 hours of work with what seems to be a temp agency.  The temp agency hires me, and it sounds like the full corporation will pick me up if they're impressed with my work.  On the surface, this opportunity sounds like EXACTLY what I'm looking for.  However, I'm already employed to a full time job with benefits.  I'd be sacrificing benefits for this job, and it worries me.  Has anyone else heard of opportunities like this?

I graduated about 4 months ago in June, and I've been looking for a web development job since July. I've had about 6 or 7 interviews but none lead anywhere, and I've submitted probably 60+ applications. Unfortunately college me didn't think it wise to really try and get an internship during school, so I only have minimum wage summer job experience (unrelated to software engineering).

I've been spending my time applying for jobs, working on side projects, learning new libraries and software, and practicing technical interview questions. I almost always hit it off personality wise with interviewers, but tend to struggle with technical questions due to anxiety and nerves, so I've been practicing those a lot more lately.

I'm looking for advice as well as inspiring stories about your long job search, how you finally landed that job and what you're doing now.

I freelance here and there as a ghost writer. I take most of my work straight from CL full of lazy students who don't want to write their homework or finish their dissertations. I can make great cash but the work isn't steady. I am also set up through a ""creative solutions company"" where people list their projects and we accept the bounty for pay. 

I volunteer for two non-profits and I sit on the board of directors for one of them. Grant writing has it's ups and downs, and we are marginally successful, yet most of our funding comes from donations. 

In terms of networking, my board is all staffed by teachers. Teaching isn't what it used to be and requires a Master's certificate. Also, I don't have what it takes to be a teacher. 99% of my networking leads me to more contract and freelance because it's easy to throw cash at a writer than hire him even part time. 

The other non-profit is a tad larger, but I am grunt working at the bottom. I only have direct contact with my supervisor and I work remotely. 

I use Angel List and Creative Circle for the majority of my applications. The beauty of these two networks (or platforms) is that I have everything linked to it. I have alerts set up on both and each morning I wake up, I have at least four new leads. 

But nobody contacts me back. I apply for the positions yet my response rate is near 0. I am applying to everything from unpaid internships to full time product management positions to everything in between. 

I've had companies express interest in me, but the communication goes dead once I reply back. 

I have a full resume, publications list, a full portfolio with expansive writing and design sections, and my own website where I host that portfolio. Fuck it, I even have professional headshots done. 

Things I might be missing: design my resume in Indesign, and start pulling bank jobs or art heists to source some extra cash. 

Things I am missing but can only learn in the industry: SEO/SEM and Mixpanel (an expensive user analytics platform). 

I know this is all karma from me turning down the only job offer I ever got because another company tempted me to hold off and wait for them (spoiler alert: they went with someone else and never told me).

Now it's been another week and still no response. Is it worth calling? I'm under a lot of pressure from a few different things and I'm scared that they might say something that will crush my self-confidence and make me screw everything else I'm doing up? Sorry for posting this again but I really need some advice."
3pjvs7,19,2015-10-20,When is it OK to renege on an offer?,Panoramic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pjvs7/when_is_it_ok_to_renege_on_an_offer/,"I'm looking for some advice!

I'm a CS undergraduate that is graduating this semester. I initially aimed for a career in a certain specialization (and have various internships in that direction) but I'm currently interning as a developer at a large company that's been in the news quite a bit lately.

I've also been undergoing the pre-employment process for a competitive position with an organization that I think would turn into one of the greatest opportunities of my life. I'm confident in my pre-employment processing but I might not hear results for up to a month from now. The position I was offered pays in the low six figures but has ridiculous growth and training potential. It is also a name that would put me anywhere I want in the future.

At the same time, my current employer dropped an offer letter on my desk that flies in at just under six figures and I have a strict deadline on deciding by next Wednesday, which is an extension from their original wish of knowing by this Thursday. This position would offer me stability that I need for my new family. It's a software development position.

I would drop everything to work the 'dream' position but the offer date is unpredictable. I've turned down offers before but I am getting close to the end of the semester and I cannot afford a gap in employment at this point. Is there any way to gracefully back out of a position you've accepted for before you start? Is this that rare? Should I just turn down the current offer?

Thanks!"

I am graduating this year, and I already have summer internship experience, so I would like to imagine I have an okay shot of being considered. 

I went to the Science/Tech career fair, and none of the ~30 companies I talked to were looking for interns for the school year. I was thinking of going to career services and seeing if they have any input, but thought I might as well ask here first, so any suggestions on how I could best go about finding school-year internships?

I finally settled on computer science. I'm currently on a 16 month (paid) internship. 

But the thing is, I'm not happy. Actually, I'm fucking miserable in my internship. I majored in computer science for the wrong reasons... I majored in it for the money and job opportunities. I've chosen money over passion throughout university (it's the reason why I changed majors 4 times). I keep chasing careers only to burn out and change majors. 

The only thing I'm passionate about it is writing. But, I only have 5 more credits left to finish my computer science degree (they're the real hard ones like operating systems, advanced algorithms). Or, I could complete 3.5 more credits and receive an english degree.

Should I follow my passions? Or stick with computer science and become a mediocre programmer who will fizzle out after a few years? What should I do Reddit?

There weren't any reqs open for next year (after I graduate), but they said that we would figure something out and that by that time comes they could open a position for me.  Since I'm finishing up my last year of school I was given the option to work a few hours a week, which I am currently doing.  

However, I'm not sure this is the company I really want to work for and I would like to see what other options are out there for me.  I've been applying and interviewing with different companies recently, and one of them asked for references.  My current boss likes me and so I figured I would ask if he would serve as a reference since my my employment at the company is a little up in the air.  I emailed him and figured he wouldn't mind, but rather than saying yes I just got a reply back asking if we could chat the next time I'm in the office.

I'm a little unsure of what to expect...How can I say (without offending my boss) that I still would like to have the option of working at my current company, but that I would also like to see what other opportunities are out there for me?  Or is there really not a way of doing that?"

Then you try to land an internship or experience while in college to get a job when you graduate. 
To sum up, college seems like such a horrible place if you're looking to be ahead of everyone upon graduating.

Currently thinking this while I'm trying to study for econ classes that I need to pass with a B or higher or else i drop out of college."

Wyld Hunt, Part 1

*It's a fast driving, multilayered masterpiece of instrumentation, suffuce with variable drum beats, synthesizers and an ethereal mezzo-soprano haunting the background, all building to a reality bending climax before slowly relaxing back down. Listen to it long enough and you will find yourself entranced, time is forgotten and you're swept along as it takes you up in its musical voyage. He hasnât even been on the scene for a year and the latest release by DJ OâBeirne proves he is not only on the cutting edge but defines it as he once again surpasses his previous offerings in the Trance genre.*

*Devon Burk, Rolling Stone*

*â¦oomph oomph oomph oomphâ¦*

Thereâs an underlying rhythm, call it a thrum or a beat to every reality, realm, dimension or wherever you call home. If youâre attuned, you can sense it, harmonize with it and even influence it.

Before the Awakening, before the Stuffed Army died and the Veil of Adulthood was ripped away, scientists called it Quantum Vibration Theory. Not much stock was put into it then but now... well they need something to explain what some people can do these days.

*â¦oompuh oompuh oomph oomphâ¦*

For the Hidden People, for the Eyeless Queen, Maâab and the Seeâli Court, music was how they attuned to their realm and they were very much in harmony with the rhythm of their existence. Times had changed though and recent traumatic events forced the Hidden People to make equally dramatic choices. King Ubâron was forced to leave his maimed mate and travel the world of Human in mufti. 

âMy Queen, we are ready to deliver the tracks.â 

Deft fingers made final adjustments to her work. A change in pitch, deeper tone, altered tempo. The magic was subtle, it had to be the weaving patterns were delicate. When she was finished, the Sightless Queen nodded to her assistant. The tiny pix'i, Acili, was not much larger than the mouse she fluttered over to and dragged into position until the pointer hovered over the 'burn' icon and with a click, started the finishing touches. With the help of the machines of Human, Maâab crafted messages and Ub'ron delivered them in the hope of calling their lost children home.

Sealing the small package in a white, black and red box with an ubiquitous three letter logo on its side, the Eyeless Queen handed it over to her two waiting messengers, âGlynn Nor, Jumping Hyn, as always tread carefully in the realm of Human and return with glad news of my beloved Ubâron. Please.â The two elâves bowed deeply, although their queen could not see the act, formality and etiquette must always be observed, especially in the Seeâli Court. Jumping one onto the otherâs shoulders, they cast their most powerful glamour. The two elâves left the Hidden realm and emerged from a sÃ­dhe under the bridge of Golden Gates. Adorned in the guise of a Human man in brown shorts, shirt and hat with that three letter logo, the two-elâves-as-one began their journey to the meeting spot.

Parker felt it long before he could hear the music, he felt it days ago and miles away. Its power drawing him to this place, club Bacchus in San Francisco. An unspoken promise of sanctuary away from *them* awaited him here. *They* had been chasing him for days without relent and every time he thought he gave them the slip, *they* proved him wrong. Now, from an alleyway across the street and the club finally in sight, he felt his hopes rising. Until he heard that voice, like liquefied gravel raking down his spine. âOh, t'was a rightfully wicked chase ye led, Changeling morsel. Had ye known thine True self like some others, ye may have made thine escape. But ye donât and ye didnât, and now âtis time for *this* Hunt to end.â

âNo.. noâ¦!â he tried calling out for help from the line of people waiting their turn for entry to the club, they were easily within were earshot but the music from inside was too loud. He gagged on spikes that felt like ice as long, spine covered fingers spread out from thin red hands and wrapped themselves around his head from behind, forcing their way into his mouth. He felt the violating digits elongate down his throat, ripping and scraping his insides as he was dragged back into the preternatural dark of the alley where childlike chitters and giggles greeted him. 

âFinish yer task in a timely manner, wee ones and donât neglect to dip thine hats, the red brings yer eyes a glorious shine.â There he was set on, feasted on by nightmares nibbling, ripping, biting, crushing, slicing, stripping, crunching. Eating.

Special Agent in Charge, Alan Lyons was a man of contrasts, not by design that's just how he turned out. His yellow shirt stood out in contrast to his dark slacks. He had a barrel chest he was once told would be perfect for opera, if his voice wasn't also perfect for grinding metal. In college they tried to recruit him for football and he probably would have been good at it but his passions lay with non-traditional sports of Jai Alai and... Curling. Grey began peppering his hair recently which he thought gave him an air of distinction, ""makes me look kind of like Andre Braugher"" he would say.

Standing in the middle of the alleyway, chewing a popsicle stick almost to paste, he took in the grisly display of body parts strewn all over the place. Chewing helped calm his mind while he focused, trying to get a Read on the crime scene. He had a talent for this but with each new body discovered the result was frustratingly the same. Nothing, not the barest wisp of anything, no aura, no history, energy or 'vibe', not even normal background detritus. Only Nothing. He chased the bodies up and down the West Coast and every scene he looked at had the same utter Nothingness. It is amazing though, how much Nothing can tell you by virtue of being Nothing. For example, it told him he was right and the prevailing theory was bullshit.

The prevailing theory, with the old guard, supposed a pair of serial killers working together or maybe in competition. Alan didn't see it that way, Serials were always methodical and rarely ever so brutal. There was never enough left of *these* bodies to tell if trophies were collected. Forensics would identify bite marks, possibly from multiple small animals, they would find internal injuries consistent with punctures from large gauge needles, missing organs and body parts and save some oddly shaped smudges very, very little blood. No, Alan had his own theories which is why he pushed for his team in the A.I.D. to take the case. But even 15 years after the Veil lifted and with all the changes the world and he had undergone since then, his theories werenât popular with the old guard of which he used to be a part. More the pity.

Special agent Beth Franks was not with the old guard, she was a 'Scully'. One of the uncommon new breed of agents finally trickling into the ranks of the agency over the last few years. They studied mystic over method, tended towards less fight and more folklore. Years ago the old guard jokingly referred to the up and coming new breed as Mulders and Scullys. Beth had no idea why until Alan explained the reference. She didn't see how the joke was apt but she did know from experience that owning it would eventually diminish the contempt the rest of the agency didn't know it felt towards her and the new breed. So, while it may have started out as an inside joke, thanks to agent Franks, âMulders and Scullysâ has slowly been accepted into the common vernacular by those agents following the unusual career path in the Awakened Investigations Division of the FBI.

She let Alan finish doing his thing before talking, âParker Anderson, 21, intern with Jetstone records in Los Angeles. The only thing identifying the body is his wallet. I contacted the field office in L.A., they'll interview coworkers, friends and family but I'm betting he fits the same pattern. Starts acting strange, disappears and a few days later turns up in a different city. What's left of him anyway.""

Having taken it all in, Agent Lyons turned to his partner, ""When forensics is done and the locals have had their piece, ship the remains to Sacramento to put with the others. I'm going to draft a request to the Awakened Council, itâs high time we found ourselves a Necromancer.â

Agent Franks was more than a little surprised. âNecromancers aren't easy to nail down, aren't they all a little..."" She didn't finish, instead she twirled her finger in a circle by her head and gave a small whistle, the universal sign for 'bonkers'.

""Yeah,"" he said, ""but I know a guy who might know someone.""

Trance music, it spoke to her like nothing else, it got under her skin in that tingly feel-good way and stayed there. She didn't know how it did that, it shouldn't be able to but she wasn't going to complain about the effect. If there was anything better in the world to listen to than DJ OâBeirne, Rachel Sand didnât want to know what it was. She needed to run, needed to clear her head. Two days ago, she was home in Portland having a fight with her therapist, Dr. Carter. ""A Writ of Command?"" She yelled. ""I'm not a Council lapdog, I'm independent.""

""You're a Necromancer."" Dr. Carter reminded her.

""Technically."" She shot back. 

""You are classified as such."" He said simply. ""There are only about a dozen Necromancers in the world and the Council feels if those skills are needed, the exclusionary clause in the Awakened Privacy Articles allows them to call on any who haven't been driven *completely* insane. That covers you as well so while itâs true youâre only technically one, youâre the most stable and qualified to fulfill the request.""

""I'm not a...â She started again but realized the futility of her protest. âHow could any of them think this is a good idea? What if somebody there has True Sight? What if somebody gets a look at Me?"" She cried.

""If the FBI had somebody capable of handling True Sight, they wouldn't be asking for your help, would they?"" He said. ""Look, only a few members of the Council are aware of your condition and even they signed the Writ."" He paused for a moment before continuing, ""People are being killed, Rachel. They think by either an Awakened or Outsider. I think that you of all people would take exception to that.""

""That was cheap, doc."" It *was* a low blow but she to concede, he was right.

""Honestly, I think your letting your fears get the better of you."" He said. So what if they find out? California has a Lycanthrope on their State Senate."" He pulled a file folder out of his desk and handed it to her, ""This is background on the case and their contact information. I know Alan Lyons, I counseled him when he Awoke. He's a good agent and a good person.""

In the end, Rachel agreed, although it wasn't really a choice with that Damoclean Writ of Command hanging over her head. Her own mother signed, that's what was most galling. Mrs 'keep your secret from everybody' like she was princess Elsa, was telling her to work with the FBI. What Dr. Clark said was true though, about taking exception. She was a child when she was victimized by an Outsider. When she learned of the repercussions from *that* incident, her feelings were mixed but at least she knew her mother and then father felt just as strongly. Rachel respected their feelings, so she would do her best.

Now here she was in Sacramento, taking a brisk run through Discovery Park. She must have been quite a sight, topping out at just over five feet tall, a hundred pounds sopping wet, wearing running shoes and shorts with a sweatshirt and wearing a surgeon's mask. All alone having a jog in the middle of December at three a.m. It wasn't that she couldn't sleep, she didn't sleep, not since she was four. Early mornings were the most boring time of day for her so she usually tried to pass it with physical activity; runs, walks, workouts at the gym. It gave her time to think and focus for the coming day and had the added bonus of helping to support her physical integrity. 

Almost tripping over the body of a homeless man was not what she would consider an ideal early morning activity though. Stopping, she looked around but didn't see anybody to call out to, not surprising considering the hour.

Pursing her lips, she knelt down next to the body and looked him over. He was dirty, old, probably about fifty, his beard more white than not, very little hair on top. His clothes were filthy and worn through all over. It was cold out and his coat was missing but not his gloves. She wondered with disgust if he was killed over something so stupid as a coat. It was his eyes though that drew her in, steely blue and still open wide. His face, frozen in a rictus of pain and shock.

Taking another look to confirm nobody else was around, ""Tell me about yourself,"" she said to him and pressed her fingers onto his eyes. The spirit left only a few hours ago, the light may be snuffed out but the body remembers. A few hours or a few centuries it doesn't matter, a connection always remains be it a trickle or a flood. The strength of the connection depending on the circumstances and condition of the death. Following his life-thread, she called back an Echo. Her eyes rolled back into her head until only the whites remained and the man showed her what she wanted, flashes of memories like a bad clip show.

*Dennis hunched over a keyboard writing* Self Discovery, Self Repair *Redfern Publishing closing it's doors forever a manuscript in the trash empty beer bottles not hiring not hiring not hiring broken family yelling fights empty house forclosure wife and child gone don't follow vodka bottles repo man took the car will work for food all alone beat up by kids just for fun whiskey bottles hungry shelter life make a friend Kenny watch each other's backs bathtub booze blackouts lost our way tremors spare any change culvert shelter lean on each other buddies voices whispering voices...* 

It was fortunate nobody was around, even in the Awakened Age, the average person wandering by would find what they saw disturbing. Rachel's eyes had glazed over with a sickly white film, the flesh of her fingers appeared to fuse over the victimâs eyes. The December chill made even colder as a translucent mist formed in a vague shape of the dead man, floating above the body. The visions continued *...spare any change tremors hungry whispers to Kenny too thirsty in the park tonight we found a dropped wallet with cash money we argued I wanted booze Kenny wanted food I hear the whispers in my head crying for booze he wanted food we yelled we fought we were weak we were not in our right minds I have a screwdriver I keep for protection we struggled he struggled harder I thought it would hurt I thought I would be cold I'm sleepy is all I...*

That's everything, peeling her fingers off the eyes she stood and turned her milky gaze to the apparition and commanded, ""Take me to Kenny."" It turned and moved off the path, further into the park and she followed. After a short while, she found herself at the edge of an incline that led down to a culvert which connected the lake to the River. About 20 yards away, she could see a drainage pipe with the glow of a campfire coming from inside. Even from that distance, Rachel could hear the whispers and see the flickering Shadows not cast by any light. ""Son of a bitch!"" She said to herself and turned to her ghostly guide, ""Well, Dennis, if you know what's good for you, you don't go down there. Any message for Kenny?""

*...a manuscript in the trash...*

""Ok, I get it, but that'll take some doing and I already have something else lined up first."" She held up a fist, ""Hey, whatever's next... good luck."" She splayed her fingers wide, dismissing the Echo like mist in the wind.

Squaring herself, Rachel made her way down the incline toward the tunnel. As she got closer, she could make the Shades out easier and hear the whispers more clearly. As she approached, they scattered in a vain attempt to get away, if Shades of the dead had any fear left in them they felt it now. But they were bound to this place and their only recourse before her advance was retreat into the recesses of the tunnel. There was a rebar gate across the opening but age and erosion ate away at the barrier, leaving an opening large enough for a reasonably sized adult. Climbing up, Rachel stood at the entrance and called out to a lone figure hunched against a wall by the fire about halfway down. Her voice echoed down the concrete shaft as she called out, ""Hello. Kenny is that you?""

The hunched over figure gave a start, ""Ahh!"" scattering trash and empty bottles as he scrambled to put his fire between himself and the voice that woke him. ""Who... who are you?"" He demanded as he clutched a blanket in one arm and pulled out a short, pointed metal object, probably the screwdriver.

Trying to sound as calm and reassuring as she could, Rachel started walking slowly towards Kenny and his fire, ""I'm Rachel and I'm not here to make trouble. Actually, I'm here to help...""

""You go away, I'm... I'm dangerous..."" he stammered while pointing the screwdriver in her direction. She kept her slow advance so he continued. ""I'm warning you... I'm... a crazy Necromancer and I'll sic zombies on you!""

""Well,"" she said as she stepped fully into the light of the fire which cast her white eyes in an eerie glow, ""in that case, I'll be extra, extra careful."""
3plj38,555,2015-10-21,NOT lost in translation,IsaapEirias,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3plj38/not_lost_in_translation/,"So actually a frustrating but good story from when I did cable service installs. a quick run down:

H=Husband

W=Wife

M=yeah that's me
___

All in all my brief experience doing cable installs was not fun- the job itself wasn't terrible but my boss needed the sort of perspective change that can only be brought about by the judicious application certain equipment to his anatomy. This particular install job was tagged with the note ""Computer in foreign language"" for some reason anytime a job involved a foreign language it was assigned to me, **DownUnder** or **Whit** because he was taking french as an elective during night classes.

I figure the OS is probably set to spanish, At least it's still windows, the set up is straight forward and I just need to do a speed test once it's installed to show it's working, no big. Except when I get there I'm greeted by an Asian gentleman whose only clear English is limited to ""hello"", ""yes"", ""no"", ""thank you"", ""please"".

&gt;M: ""Hi I'm with $CraptasticCable I'm supposed to do an install for you today at 2:30.""

&gt;H: ""yes""

&gt;M: ""Okay I just need you to-""

&gt;H: ""No""

I pause as he holds up his hand and starts dialing a number on his phone and puts it on speaker. After the second ring I hear a female voice answer and there's a rapid fire exchange before he holds the phone towards me.

&gt;W: ""Hello?""

&gt;M: ""Um, yes I'm supposed to do an install for $CraptasticCable today to get you set up with phone, internet, and tv.""

&gt;W: ""Oh! I thought that was tomorrow I'm sorry my husband is still learning English, do you have a tech that knows Chinese?""

I glance at the number on the phone's screen and note it's the contact number on the order form and heave a mental sigh of relief.

&gt;M: ""Unfortunately no, if you don't mind relaying what you want over the phone I can do the work pretty quick. If anything comes up that I have questions about I can call you again.""

&gt;W: ""Oh thank you so much!""

I go ahead with getting details the husband leads me into the house occasionally asking questions with his wife translating over the phone and I find out where everything needs to go. I make a few quick calls to fellow techs I like to get the next couple jobs reassigned so I have some spare time and nobody is left waiting and set to work.

I run the cable to the apartment and then head back in to hook up the cable and internet. The cable goes off without a hitch and I even manage without calling the wife to demonstrate the basic cable functions to the husband.

The next part was tricky- they wanted wifi through us (normally I try to talk customers out of it because as everyone knows ISP and cable provided wifi routers are horrible) but I took the easy out and didn't waste time here with it and instead hooked it up and ran a few test with my own laptop to make sure it worked then turned to the customers laptop.

The OS wasn't just in Chinese, the keyboard layout was different and every key was marked only with Chinese characters- time to call the wife.

&gt;W: ""Hello this is Dr.Pokes?"" (obviously altered)

&gt;M: ""Hi, this is Isa. I'm installing your internet and I need your help guiding your husband through connecting your laptop to the wifi.""

&gt;W: ""Oh, well neither of us are very good with computers I don't know how well that will work.""

&gt;M: ""Well, I'm having to guess by the layout of what I'm seeing but I believe I'm familiar with the operating system, if I tell him where to click and what to type can you translate for me? If that doesn't work I'll leave a card with my personal number and you can call me and I'll come back when you come home.""

&gt;W: ""Well that sounds like it's worth a trying.""

I switch my phone to speaker and go about the process of guiding someone that is completely inept at computers through the process of connecting Windows Vista to a wifi connection, there were a few stumbling blocks we tried to get the WPA typed right (look the entire screen could have been reciting the secret of life and I wouldn't have been able to tell) but after the most interesting 30 minutes of face to face/ over the phone tech support I've ever had we finally got him online and ran a speed test- for those curious they got double the promised speeds, a fact I failed to note in my final report for the install.

About a year later I'd nearly forgotten the incident when my mother started as an intern with an acupuncturist. I stopped by on my way to work to drop off a lunch she forgot and got to meet the wife in person as well as see the husband who recognized me immediately. The man now speaks perfectly fluent English and both have become much better at dealing with computers.

TL:DR- Tried hard for a user, they not only tried hard when I was there, they also actually LEARNED something!"

I'm getting paid a fair wage and I have no complaints about what I'm currently doing. The research group is based at a university two states away, and all of my work is done remotely.

I am also going to school full-time for computer science. I am in the process of applying for internships for next summer, and I honestly think I have a realistic shot at getting a great software engineering internship. I will graduate in Spring 2017.

The lead programmer just quit, and they extended an offer for me to take over. The group is receiving funding very quickly and is clearly on the upward spiral. I would start at $50,000/year with benefits and everything, however they want me to move there to do it. I would have to finish my bachelor's at a local tech institute, and I would probably be going to school part-time. 

Seeing as how the funding is going up, I could be making around $100,000/year within 6-10 months, and this is in an area where the cost of living is very, very low. 

Should I take the offer, move two states for the job, and delay my schooling by at least a year? Or is this Lead Programmer position not worth it - should I do a software engineering internship next summer and graduate at my expected graduate date? It's worth noting that I don't want to live in the city where the job is at after I graduate, however it is my sister that runs the show (along with a highly, nationally respected professor).

Thanks as always!"

I started at a higher end hotel right out of college as an intern and over the course of 8 years worked my way up to banquet manager. Basically overseeing the setup and execution of events like weddings, business meetings, parties, etc. My last 3 or 4 years there I really wanted to get into the sales department and interviewed for the position twice an didn't get it. It was very clear that I had reached the ceiling there and needed something new.

About 7 months ago I was finally able to land a sales and catering manager position with a different hotel that was definitely a step down as far as facility but a step up in position. It has been a struggle because this place is a mess and a lot more than I expected simply because they are not properly staffed and I am forced to do another position from time to time. My plan had been to stick it out for a year, have a nice resume boost an start looking for something better with my new sales experience.

In my time at my current property I became friends with the front office manager and we would bond over the obvious shortcomings of our hotel and what needed to be done. One day he drops it on me that he has accepted a position at a resort a little over an hour away and that he wants me to join him as a Director of Sales.

On the surface it seems like a great opportunity but there are a lot of red flags. It is definitely a step up as far as position but only $3000 more a year base salary with bonus incentives and quite frankly I kind of feel like the guy has been set up to fail, going from front office manager at a struggling hotel to general manager at a resort property. As for myself going from a sales and catering manager to director of sales, is that something that I can handle?
There would also be an hour commute each day. On the plus side if I was successful I should be able to easily leverage a better salary and eventually move onto a better resort.

I'd really appreciate a little advice or to hear peoples experience in similar situations. Thanks in advance.

I have a job in a large service based company.
I can program in Java, C++, Python and PHP. I have a couple of basic projects in PHP and C++. I am comfortable with most of the Data structures and algorithms questions. 

*But I don't have any internship exp (getting one here is unusual).*
*I also don't have any in-depth projects per se.* 

I am planning to work on some open source projects, and improving my data structures &amp; algorithm skills further. I wish to develop my skills and resume till next April after which I will start applying to some product based companies.
I wish to get a shot at a Google interview. I don't think sending my resume to the Google careers page will help (They get loads from here in India, &amp; they only prefer the top school grads). So, a referral is the only way for me to at-least get an interview (Getting an interview at a Big 4 is extremely difficult here unless you go to the top schools).

So:

1. Would someone over here be willing to refer me? 

2. Will I be able to interview in India when someone refers me from MTV? 

3. Would having excellent dsa knowledge &amp; projects be enough to get a Google interview? 

4. Btw if possible, I would like to work in Google Zurich.

Edit:
I also practice problems on Codeforces (competitive programming site, helps to develop dsa skills). I am currently 'Green' here. It is said that a 'Yellow' coder can easily ace the Google interview. So would becoming a Yellow coder be an adequate demonstration of my skills along with the resume?"

The following week, I had a technical interview for it. I had some good moments, and some where I should have had better answers prepared.

About a month later, the manager calls me and gives me a verbal job offer (at twice what I currently make). He tells me not to quit my current job yet, that a written offer should follow shortly, and in the meantime to complete some background checks.

A couple weeks later, I hear back that my background check completed successfully. I forward this to the manager. He says things are in order but moving slowly.

A month after that, I check in. He says there are no updates, and to keep waiting.

Currently, it's been 6 months since the interview. I still don't have anything in writing. My friends that work there say it normally takes 6 months, but also that there is significant turbulence in Development currently.

3ppbp9,5,2015-10-21,Second year MSc student in neuroscience wanting to transition into CS - what's my best course of action?,thehorrorfrog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ppbp9/second_year_msc_student_in_neuroscience_wanting/,"As the title says, I'm a 25-year-old second year MSc student looking to get into computer science.  A bit of background on me: I'm very strong in stats and math, and I've programmed things off and on as a hobby since high school.  I have some experience in CS courses, and I've done some coding to automate my data cleaning for my current project, but I'm nowhere close to having a minor or anything like that.  My goal right now is to transition into CS as quickly and smoothly as possible, in a way that will make me attractive to employers once I (finally) get out of school.  I'm currently looking at three options:

1: I'm doing a practicum with a lab at my university that works on developing ways for visually impaired students to understand mathematical concepts more easily.  The project will involve substantial coding and math, and will allow me to make use of the research skills I've already acquired working on my MSc project.  The PI I'll be working with has suggested that I look into doing a PhD (joint program through Dept. of Computer Science and Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics), and I think this approach has a lot of advantages.  

First, I'd end up with a more advanced degree than if I went back into another undergrad, and I'd be getting paid as a graduate student, rather than paying tuition as an undergrad.  I would also be getting experience working on a project, rather than just taking courses.  I talked to the department head, and she said I could take undergraduate courses while working on a PhD, and that they could also waive prerequisites for upper year and graduate courses provided I'm okay with teaching myself some concepts.  My estimate is that I can get through all of the algorithms courses, a few higher level maths courses, and few other upper year core CS courses in the time it will take me to finish my PhD.  I'm not sure if I would be able to do internships as part of this program.  

The two major drawbacks are that my degree will be in ""Computing Science"" and not ""Computer Science"", and that we're not a well known CS school, though we're about 40 minutes driving from one of the best schools in the country (Canada).  How will potential employers see this kind of degree?  Or will they even care, assuming that I can demonstrate that I'm good at what I do in a technical interview?

2: There are a few schools that offer 2 year second degrees in CS.  One of them is well known and offers a co-op option, while the other one has a good reputation in other disciplines and does not offer a co-op option, but would keep me closer to my girlfriend.  Both would give me a bachelor's degree in CS.

3: A good school near me offers an MSc program that I could enter as a transitional student, meaning that I would need to take undergraduate courses before I start my graduate coursework.  I talked to someone at my home school who estimated that this would take about 4 years in total, compared to 3 if I go the PhD route.  This program also includes a co-op option.

What's my best option for maximizing my employability once I finish?  In the short term, the PhD program at my current school seems like a great option.  Good funding and a guaranteed 3-year timeline are hard to find in any PhD program, and I think the work will be more stimulating and provide more opportunity for professional development in the short term.  I just don't want to get out of school at 29 and find out that my degree is worthless.  "

I tried to apply for entry-level jobs (all out of state) for a couple of months after graduating, but very few places even bothered to respond. Eventually I became so discouraged that I gave up looking for a job. All I've done since then is spend an entire year unemployed then working part-time at a Starbucks until 2 months ago.

Long story short, I did some growing up the past two years, and now I'm ready to move on. But I'm not sure where to start.

Currently, I am looking into coding schools, considering I'm still don't have experience. I would not only get experience programming a variety of languages I'm unfamiliar with, being able to find work soon after competing it seems promising. Or at least, that's how it looks.

So anyway, I would appreciate it if I can get some advice on how to finally begin a career as a programmer after 2 year gap. Any advice and top picks for coding schools will help, unless it's not such a good idea. Any alternative solutions and other tips is appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I had to drop out two years into my college career(majoring in Biochemistry at the time) as I was unhappy with my major and was trying to fulfill my parents wishes of becoming a doctor.  I knew I wanted a career in technology but never felt confident in what I wanted to do specifically.

I realized I was wasting too much money not knowing what to do, and with my family not doing so great financially during the recession, I decided to withdraw and move back home to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.  I worked several years through Amazon Turk and was able to make pretty decent money as well (averaging $20/hour working 9 hours a day on weekdays).  Unfortunately, Mturk isn't the most consistent and reliable and I realized I needed to get my career moving in order to really move up the ladder.

I applied for various help desk jobs and ended up landing a decent job at an educational company where I ran through the software like a normal student would and documented any bugs.  After 3 months, I was promoted to the QA team as an intern and am about to hit the 3 month mark.  

After reading about other people's career path, I've been working on trying to gain some automation skills as well as learn Java as it is what the company mainly works with.  It seems like a career path of Manual QA -&gt; Automation QA -&gt; Software Dev is something I can work towards, but I'm not sure how to make that step of being an intern to a salaried employee.  

I had a one-month review during my internship to ask me how things were going and where I saw myself with the company in the future type of questions.  I should have asked about what kind of timeline to expect, but right now I have no idea how long this internship will last and what I should do.  I made $15/hour starting out and am now making $20/hour(no benefits) when I started as a QA Intern.  I would like to become a salaried QA Tester, but when I reach that point, should I use what I see on glassdoor to negotiate my offer? I don't want to be too greedy as I am very grateful for this opportunity and I don't have much leverage due to how little experience and the lack of a degree.  If it gets to that point, I don't want to try to counter-offer when I don't have any leverage and it will be entry-level for me.

Should I just accept whatever offer they give me and is there a normal timeline for when they offer an intern an offer?

I live in the Bay Area."

&gt; Enter:  April 4, 2012
&gt; 
&gt; (Judgeâs Signature)
&gt; 

The day of the court decision, I received a text from my mother.  This was three phones ago, but I recall the following.  I was asked by Mother what the sum of my student loan debt was, because the judge wanted to know.  I logged into my loan servicer's website for the first time and saw the sum total was ~$36k.  I told her the exact number, also by text.  It's my assumption that the judge awarded me part of the money to ameliorate my student debt, but that's just an educated guess, and perhaps irrelevant anyway.

I later received a phone call from Mother.  We had a conversation and she said that she wanted me to share the cost of the attorney's fees, because she had to pay them but I received part of the award.  I did not agree to this, either in conversation or in writing, at any point in time.  

I then contacted the student legal counsel office at my university and met with him and one other person, I believe he was an intern.  I asked them for advice on how to handle this.  I had no idea what to do, but knew I needed help in examining my options.  He told me that the emotional and relational aspects of this matter were beyond his scope but he said that I did not legally owe any money to Mother.  

Mother and I, in examining the order, agreed that she would set up the child support payments to deposit into her bank account, and she would write me a monthly check for $125.00.  This has been the case since.  I did this because any account we would set up would be subject to checking fees, and I didn't want that to be the case.  I remind her toward the end of every month, and a check is either mailed to me or given to me when I come to visit, which I do about once a month.  This conforms with the spirit, but not the letter of the order, but was mutually agreed as a convenience for us both.

Sometime within the last year she asked when I would begin paying back the attorney's fees.  I reminded her that I never agreed to pay those fees, because I didn't want the lawsuit to happen in the first place (they were amicable toward one another before this, not so anymore).  She became very upset, and I let the matter rest (this was mostly by text message).  I contact the student legal counsel at my old university to ask him if he still had records about our meeting.  He did and remembered it.  

More recently I've begun reminding her by text and email to write and send the monthly check, since before I did so by voice and I suspect, but won't allege, that one month here or there was skipped because I forgot to remind her.  

The reason I bring this matter to your attention is that I was included in a conference call about them taking out a Parent PLUS loan to help my bother pay for college.  This was just a conversation to let us know, since neither my sister or I received aid from them to help pay for school.  She got off on a tangent, and remarked that in the case of Mother and step-father's deaths, we would owe whatever money we owed them to the estate, and any money coming from liquidation of assets or life insurance payouts would be discounted the amount of the money we owed them.  This was and is going to be true for my bother's Parent PLUS loan, which they will demand he pay back over time.  She also remarked that I still owed them a thousand dollars.  I was not on the phone when this conversation happened.  I declined the call because I was busy and later heard this in a four minute voicemail I received.  Thus I know that she still believes, expects, or wishes me to pay her $1,000 for part of the attorney fees she incurred in her lawsuit against my father.

My questions to you all:

How should I handle this?  Should I contact an attorney?  Should I set up a bank account with my mother to conform with both the spirit and the letter of the court order?  What is prudent to do?  What is fair?  What is right?

My problem is, I have half-decent grades (equivalent GPA of 3.80+) but I don't have the extracurricular actives many of the schools look for in ""outstanding students"".

As part of my degree here, I have to complete a placement year, which is basically a year-long internship.

It's mandatory for me to do this (If I can't find one I have to basically proved I tried my hardest to get one and try to get an exemption but more often than not this won't happen.) The vast majority of people who do them just get somewhere relatively local, but I'd really like to use the opportunity to try working a year in the US (because it'd be a fantastic experience and look great on my CV even if I don't end up moving there after the degree). Most of the companies I've been looking at only seem to offer summer internships, however, and while that would be a great opportunity under normal circumstances, my placement year has to be of a minimum length (I believe it's 10 months.) so an internship like this won't be enough.


My question is; how would I even go about this? Should I start contacting companies about this sort of thing? Do US companies commonly offer year long internships, even to international students? Or should I just start emailing companies and seeing if I can convince them to interview me for a year long position/internship? 

For context, I don't have any CS work experience yet as I have only completed 1 year of my degree (this placement year is meant to be a great way for students here to get experience) and I have a strong academic background and a bunch of small projects I've done in my spare time."

I am hoping someone will be able to help figure out what to do to start a career in the field of software development.

I graduated from uni in UK in May 2014 with a 2:2 in Computer Science: Games Programming course. While the grade wasn't the best I had pretty good grades at strictly programming and DB related modules. While not an expert I know my way around few languages such as JS, C#, SQL. At the end of my course I developed a simple game in Unity for which I got a decent grade. While at uni I didn't get any work experience.

Fast forward to today. I feel like I forgot some of the things I learnt though I still know the major concepts such as OO, methodologies, analysis and design and always know how to find what I need to know. I am also not sure what to do to score my first programming job. I just don't know what to focus on. C#/.NET? HTML5? Python vs PHP? I like everything too much to be able to decide. I also feel like it's too late to even try and get an internship so long after graduating and without focusing on single thing I don't think I am competent to get any entry level job.

I hope my post makes sense and that somebody will be able to guide me as to what I should do so my degree doesn't go to waste."

So I'm graduating in December and the company I worked for as an intern over the summer gave me an offer and wanted an answer within 3 weeks. This didn't leave me much time to interview at other places and I accepted the offer because I wasn't sure if I'd get another offer...

Later one of the companies I had applied for over the summer contacted me and I went through the interview process and got an offer from them today. It's about $20k more than what my the first company offered and includes a $10k moving bonus and other smaller benefits.

Is it too late to negotiate with the first company? I really want to work at the first company because the field they work in interests me and the people I worked with were really fun. I just wish the pay difference wasn't so big. The sad thing is the second company is in a lower cost of living area too making the salary difference even bigger.

This post is for those of you, like me, that have a GPA below 3.0, little to no projects to list on your resume, and those who may struggle with an interview. This is for you, you can do it!

Background: I am a junior that is an okay programmer, not great, but I can do about 75% of my school programming projects without having to worry. My GPA is shy of 3.0. I have no prior related work experience, and no personal programming projects. If I posted my resume on here, it would get critiqued out of the subreddit. I suffer from Imposter Syndrome, I often worry I will never be good enough for this field. Despite all of this, I got an internship.

I'm not picky, I don't need a great internship at some huge company, I just need one that I can hang my hat on and say that I have done this before. I am most of you. It can be so discouraging reading these posts while going through these interviews, but know that no matter who you are, if you try hard enough, you can do it. 

As a sophomore, I handed about 15-20 resumes and had 1 interview from the career fair that I attended, from that I had a secondary interview, that lead to no offer. 

This year as a junior, talked to about 30 companies at the career fair, interviewed with 4 on the spot, and 1 a few days later, lead to two secondary interviews with 2 companies and 1 eventual offer. I won't go into details about location, pay, or anything like that. But it's a nice company and I'm from an average state school. It still hasn't sunk in, I never thought this day would come. 

I know there are people that come here and are in the same boat as I am in. You want it so bad. Just know that you can do it. If I can, then anyone can. I even got about half of the technical questions wrong but worked through it with help and was able to communicate my thoughts. Sometimes that's all it takes. This is for you, don't ever give up. "

3pulhm,1,2015-10-22,College major -- Programming for NASA/SpaceX/Aerospace companies,SwiftSlug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pulhm/college_major_programming_for_nasaspacexaerospace/,"Disclaimer:
Wall of text inc, save yourself now.

So I'm not your typical programmer. I was always the kid who loved planes, then I became the kid who fixed everyone's tech problems (mostly software-based, I never actually worked much with hardware but I definitely knew my way around figuring out if the problem was in the hardware or software, I just never wanted to void my warranties). I did always take it upon myself to fix things (though generally I was only permitted to mess with the technology because no one else in my family knew how to fix them), and as a young kid I designed stuff in my head, but I grew frustrated with being unable to draw my designs very well, so I turned to improving my communication skills so I could convey the ideas verbally. 

Now, after spending some time in school thinking about astrophysics and still occasionally thinking about robotics engineering, I've been pursing CS. I enjoy CS because I like watching my programs come to life, I love seeing a bunch of characters on a page suddenly become a beautiful entity. I've never been bad at math, but I've also not responded to the typical math teaching style of ""here is two hours worth of how to solve these specific equations but I'm not going to actually explain the thought process of how to solve problems."" I love creating, possibilities, and puzzles. To the best of my understanding, CS is the most fitting for this style of interest; that said, I'm not particularly interested in many of the more traditional CS puzzles. Making my own video games, software for meaningless drivel applications (Who really needs twitter. Like, why. What is the point?), these are the type of things that sound like the most boring, useless, meaningless wastes of a lifetime to me. Big data and cloud computing are one slight step up, but thoroughly uninspiring for me. 

I made my own website in HTML, which I'm still working on and I've actually enjoyed, but I've noticed a lot of the programming challenges interest me because of their novelty, in addition to the fact they're useful to me. Once I've solved the puzzles once and created the idea (of course you do have to fix all the bugs, which I also enjoy doing, that's part of solving the puzzle), I don't have any desire to do that puzzle again (in essence, I'm saying despite the fact I enjoyed making my own website, I don't think I would enjoy web development). The problem for me is I simply don't find programming *interesting.* I enjoy it, but I'm just not that interested in it. This is a major area of concern for me, because I'm aware that programming is a life-long learning process, and I don't know if I'd be interested enough to seek out new techniques and languages on my own time (unless as part of personal projects, which I do have several ideas for when I get some time).

So, I've been doing a lot of soul searching. The best thing I've come up with is I believe I would enjoy combining my love of aircraft with my love of CS, to write programs for NASA or SpaceX or other Aerospace companies. I'm not *only* interested in aerospace, but to be perfectly frank I feel much more at home working with the engineers (at least at my school) than I feel working with the CS majors, and when I have thought about it in depth, I'd like to be the guy who does the programming end engineering. I reached this conclusion by, in the course of considering Robotics Engineering, considering what role I would like to be (or be most comfortable) in charge of if I were to participate in engineering competitions. I am a third year, but current plan is to get a BS in CS and minor in Astrophysics. UCSC doesn't have AE or ME; we only have EE, CE, Robitics Engineering (though to be fair, our RE is mostly just CE with a couple statics and dynamics classes attached), and CS.

TL;DR
I think I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do (programming for engineering and preferably aerospace) but I don't know the best way to go for it.

This, however, presents a few issues:
1. I would think these are the types of jobs it's probably far more difficult to acquire?
2. I'm more than willing to put in whatever effort in whatever field it takes me to get there, but I'm not sure if I'm even going in the correct direction. Am I correct that CS major and Astro minor would be most appropriate for getting a job programming for the Aerospace industry? I am considering a CE major with a programming emphasis as well, but I wasn't sure which would be more appropriate.
3. Will I be unhappy with my choice to go for CS if I can't get a job in the Aerospace industry? Am I putting all my eggs in one basket? I wouldn't mind working with robots or programming other things, but I'm more interested in an engineering side of CS than a video game or silly useless app side of it. I want to be involved in concrete things that really matter, not one more bloody social media application or one more way for people to waste time or one more information collection service so companies can better target their adds... If I was stuck doing that for the rest of my life I don't even think I'd work in the software industry, I'd probably find a job doing something else and maybe write programs on my own time. I wouldn't mind doing menial software for an internship or two, I enjoy learning things the first time around, I just don't think I could do that as a career."

Web dev compared to more traditional software engineering feels very different. So far I definitely don't like web development nearly as much... everything I do in web dev almost feel like the wild west. Probably just more of a product of me sucking at it right now and need to get better, so hopefully my opinion changes later on. 

One of the thing that inspire me to do some web development is this website: http://www.asterank.com. The browser is such a powerful medium. if asterank was a desktop application no one would care to download and install to check it out. As a web application, it is infinitely easily to share with people. But... at the same time not enjoying web development as much (at least for now...).

I found out today I made it to host matching with Google, for a software engineering internship from January - April. I have an offer deadline of November 2nd to join the company I interned at this past summer (my recruiter told me it was October 27, but I think I'll be able to push it to November 2nd). My Google recruiter is aware of this deadline, and told me she'll do her best to expedite the host matching process.

Several questions:

* Is it even possible to expedite host matching? I've read it takes 6-8 weeks on average (with some people waiting months) to get matched with a host. Is it possible this can be done in &lt;2 weeks?
* Will my pending offer deadline decrease my chances at being matched with a host? I'd hate if, in 2 weeks, my Google recruiter comes back with ""welp, we couldn't find you a host in 2 weeks, cya"" when I might be able to extend my offer deadline to late November or even December
* Would this be an instance where it's OK to tell my company I'm coming back, then if I get matched with a host renege on the offer?

Sorry for yet another Google host matching thread (and I'll be emailing my recruiter these questions tomorrow) - I just wanted to see if anyone had any experience with expediting the host matching process."

3pvj26,6,2015-10-23,"I panicked during a phone interview, shut off my phone and lied to the interviewer about it. Should I come clean?",panicattheinterview,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3pvj26/i_panicked_during_a_phone_interview_shut_off_my/,"Hi there,

I had an interview last Monday for a digital marketing position in a tech company based in San Francisco. The interviewer sounded friendly enough but the second question he asked me was just out-of-the-box. I forgot exactly what he asked but I remember being taken by surprise. I had what I believe was an anxiety attack. I struggled to answer for a few seconds and was on the verge of tears but no words were coming out of my mouth. Desperate, I turned off the phone, cutting off the interview. I sent an email to the interviewer saying that my phone shut down and wouldn't turn on. I never checked my email since. I cried a bit for a few minutes, wondering why I just broke down like that. I did nothing for the next few days, just redditing, gaming and looking at funny pictures.

I moved to the US a few months ago. My last company laid off half the office, me included. I finally had it with working in BPOs and I desired to work with one of the tech companies based in the US. It was hard leaving my home and all of my friends but I decided that I needed to leave my comfort zone. I have about $2,400 in savings left though I am currently living with an aunt of mine, so I don;t need to worry about rent. I had since submitted a lot of applications, had a few interviews here and there and did a few assessments but I never was able to land a job.

I've slowly been losing my confidence with every rejection letter I received. I initially applied to the digital marketing positions I once had in my country but I then started applying to lower positions just to get a job, which also affected my confidence. The stress of my dwindling cash reserves wasn't helping as well. I rarely get to chat with my friends back home due to our different time zones; I tried finding friends here via meetups.com but I figured that going out would cost me money so I decided that getting a job would be first priority. Will all that, I guess what happened last Monday was the straw that broke the camel's back.

I just snapped out of my stupor today after talking with a friend about a colleague of his that had undergone depression and tried committing suicide.I took a long hard look at what I've been doing since I arrived in America, noting the things I could've done as I was looking for a job. 

I'm now back in the job search. I've resigned myself to the fact that I will need to start at the bottom since I am starting over in another country, and that's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm now currently looking for entry level content writing or account management jobs in the digital marketing field or internships, if any will be willing to take a 30+ year old. Any spare time I have left will be spent improving myself. I'm going to head back to the gym after a year of skipping out. I also need to improve my technical skills which is why I'm brushing up on my excel knowledge. I'm planning to get a Google Analytics certificate and have also applied for financial aid for Coursera's course in html.

Sorry for the rant. It's just that what happened last Monday is still bothering me. I do believe the interviewer deserves an explanation of some kind about my behavior last Monday. Should I tell him the truth? I'm willing to listen to any feedback about me, my situation and how I handled everything. I don't care if it'll be blunt and hurtful, as long as it's honest; we all need a dose of reality sometimes.

TL;DR: I panicked during a phone interview last Monday and turned off the phone. I told the interviewer that the phone broke but never got back to him since. Should I tell him the truth?"

In the past two week I had three Skype interviews scheduled with three different startups for the position of software developer intern.

So I wasted more than a hour + time preparing for interviewing both time. On contacting them through E-Mail, they made poor excuses. 

Am I the only one who is facing this or is this relatively common? It don't make any sense. I feel it is very unprofessional to keep someone wait."

3pwum1,13,2015-10-23,Inevitability postmortem and my gamedev experience over the past 5 years.,SfsBen,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3pwum1/inevitability_postmortem_and_my_gamedev/,"Hey everyone, my first game Inevitability launched almost exactly two months ago on Steam and I havenât really written down all my thoughts about the whole experience so I decided to do that, and that this would be a good place to do it! Anyways Iâm probably about to ramble a lot feel free to skim around, but I think itâs a fun story so anyways letâs start from the beginning. 


**Planning 2010-2012**
	About five years ago I was a junior in high school and had just discovered the wonders of programming two years prior and was getting the hang of it. I wanted to make a cool game so in my free time I would try and come up with ideas. The way I did it was thought, what game do I want to play, but canât because it doesnât exist. Then it hit me, building cool 2D spaceships (it wasnât a thing in 2010 as much as it is now :P)  So I started planning it whenever I had free time and soon realized this was going to be way too big of a project for my then level of programming experience, So I made a ton of smaller games for the next two years until the end of high school. Finally as my senior year was coming to a close I felt I was ready to make my game I was calling Fate. I named it that for many reasons at the start, because I felt like it was my fate to be a programmer and I worked it into the theme of the game of âIt is Fate that man will live among the starsâ. 


 **Initial Creation 2012-2014**
	So the summer before my first year in college I started on my game. I started it off the best way I knew how, staying up for 72 hours straight and getting a functional core. I ended up doing so and by the end of it I had a working ship building framework in place, a lot of this code ended up being a functional mess, but it worked and it gave me so much motivation! So I worked on this the rest of summer and through the first year of college refining it and cleaning up my terribly messy code. That next summer I got a job at Dairy Queen, nothing against Dairy Queen, but it was not fun at all. Working there did something weird to me though it gave me so much motivation to improve my programming skills and work on Fate so my daily schedule was to wake up around one go to dairy queen work till 8-10ish then come home and code until I fell asleep around 7 in the morning. A lot got done here and I was really excited to share it with the world.


 **First Launch 2014**
	I wanted to share this game that I was having a blast playing and creating so I decided to put it up on Steam Greenlight and see what people thoughtâ¦â¦ people criticized it hard, as they could only see the art the game had at the time also that I couldnât name it Fate as there is already a game with that name :P (no clue how I missed that) so I renamed it Inevitability with the same meaning that fate had. This game was inevitable for me and I really think man will Inevitability concur space and live among the stars. Anyways it was a real bummer, seeing that initial wave of scrutiny for my game due to the art, but I knew if people played it and understood it like I did they would see why it was good. So I decided to release it in August of 2014 on my own website so people could play it. There was a mixed response, people who gave it a chance long enough to understand it, loved it and I had nice long talks with some of them about what they liked about it and the cool ships they had made, however a large amount of people where, put off by my poorly drawn art and lack of explanation of parts of the game. All in all I only sold about 30 copies, but it was still really cool to see people responding to what I spent a large part of past two years of my life working on.

 
 **Steam Greenlight 2014-2015**
	I continued to update Inevitability for the next couple months making the art better, the menus more bearable, and trying overall to add to what made the game enjoyable. However my working time started to dwindle off from Inevitability to another project around November of 2014. That summer something awesome happened, I got an email from Steam. I opened up my inbox and saw an email from Steam after coming home from my internship I had over summer 2015 and immediately I thought âoh no someone hacked my account and reset my passwordâ¦â I opened it and it said that Inevitability had been greenlit. I was so shocked and happy, honestly it still is on my list of happiest moments so far in my life. My first thought after the excitement of sharing Inevitability with the world was âI NEED TO MAKE IT BETTER!!!â so I spent much of my free time polishing everything I could about the game and added more stuff to do such as story. I was spending 50+ hours a week after my internship coding and doing art for Inevitability. I wasnât tired at all however as I was still so excited. 


 **Steam launch till now August 2015-now** 
	So I polish my game and set a date for it to come out on Steam, I stay up all night eagerly waiting to see what everyone thinks about itâ¦ but I forgot to add something critical things in all my polish, a comprehensive tutorial and endgame balance, this was apparent in the first few reviews on Steam and the general response. My stomach churned how I could be so foolish I should have polished more! I was so upset that on launch night (really morning) without having even slept in 24 hours I set out to improve and fix the wrongs that Inevitability had inside of it. I really wanted people could experience that core joy that I got when creating a cool ship and overcoming a foe with your own ingenuity. I read over every line of those reviews addressing every issue, fixing, polishing and balancing everything they didnât like about the game. One month later I released an update with those fixes, but the damage had already been done, my review score was 57% positive and the top review was a lengthy negative one. People wouldnât give my game enough of a look to experience what I had with the game. However it wasnât all bad as I said people who would give it a chance and would put up with building a few bad ships that get killed to learn how the game works loved it like I did and that really made it all worth it in the end. 
 

**Conclusion/summary**
	Anyways I learned a lot about a little of everything from my whole experience with Inevitability. 

* Gamedev is hard and takes a lot of time

* Art is EXTREMELY important is should be focused and polished before showing to a lot of people

* Tutorials are very important and should not be ignored

* Balancing of a game is also important and should be a large focus

* Don't give up when people don't like your game

* Be open to the idea that your game can ALWAYS be better than it currently is, take criticism and use it to improve  

* Don't be afraid to rewrite massive portions of your game to improve the flow

* large amounts of Mountain Dew helps you stay up for ridiculous amounts of time

Thank you for those who actually read this massive ramble I just really wanted to vent my thoughts about my gamedev experience to the world.

3pwxfw,1,2015-10-23,I am quitting my job today and could use some advice.,blue_poppy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3pwxfw/i_am_quitting_my_job_today_and_could_use_some/,"I'm quitting my job of 4 years today.  Yesterday I received and accepted an offer from a rival of my firm who rents space in the same building (different floor).  I've been waiting for an opening at that firm for months and it finally happened!!  We aren't traditional competitors but there is a lot of bad blood between my current boss and the owners of my new job. As a quick pretext, I work in a very small office of 4 people and an intern (previously 7 but I will explain later).  About 5 months ago, one of the partners of my firm left our office for my new employer in a flames of glory type fashion.  He gave  1 month notice, caught wind of something petty another partner said and cleared out his office not even 4 days after giving notice.  I won't go into all of the details but suffice to say, the dissolution of their partnership is ongoing and getting ugly.



Roughly 3 months later, our 2 sub tenants left our office and began leasing space in my new employers office.  This left me with 2 older women who *hate* each other and, an intern.  My boss took their departure really hard and still tells me how much it hurt him and felt like a personal attack.  Today is my turn.  To say that I am miserable in my current job is an understatement.  I won't wax poetic, but every day I have to go to work is the worst day of my life.  My office is disorganized despite my best efforts, everyone is always upset, and my boss is constantly dropping the ball with anything client related.  It's a very hard place to work, I am #42 in the last 10 years to be hired and quit.  The turnover at my new job is less than 1 person every 2 years and it's a company of 40 people.



My boss is a very complicated person.  He kind of reminds me of the nutty professor; truly brilliant in some aspects, but is sorely lacking in people skills.  He has been the main source of stress in my life since I started working there, but we have a good working relationship.  He has said many times that he sees me as a daughter and plans on having me work for him forever.  Obviously I have no plans of entertaining this idea but I am a little nervous about breaking the news.   I'm pretty worried that he is going to have a very very bad reaction.  I could really use some advice on how to break it to him.  "
3px558,3,2015-10-23,Should I give the SAT again?,TheRealPizza,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3px558/should_i_give_the_sat_again/,"So I am an International Student in the 11th Grade right now, and I will be applying to US Colleges for the term starting in the fall of 2017. I just got the result for my first SAT (the October SAT), and it was a bit higher than expected (which is why I'm elated), and I'm thinking that I don't need to give it again. Here's my scores:  
Critical Reading-670  
Writing-750  
Math-780  
Total-2200  
I'm planning to apply to some good Comp Sci Colleges, including a few of the UCs (Berkeley would be my favourite to get into), and also, Georgia Tech, University of Texas at Austin and maybe University of Michigan. Also, I might look at colleges in some other countries including University of British Columbia (in Canada) and University College London.  
I haven't really got much in terms of ECs, except for two internships (one at a software company), a couple years of swimming, and a couple years of piano. I've still got more than a year to go so I've started working on these, and I've joined the school's Brass Band, and started volunteering at some local shelters.  
Right now, I have to decide whether to take the SAT again, or whether this will be good enough for my applications. If I take it again, the negative will be that I waste quite a bit of my time preparing for it again, but I might be able to bump up my score by (Hopefully), around 100 points. Looking for your opinion on whether or not to take it. Thanks in advance!"

Dabbled a bit in both Java and Ruby, but still got a long way to go to establish a firm foundation for either.

I looking to build up an impressive skill set and be able to create my own projects. I'm really passionate about it and wouldn't mind self-learning via online portals. 


I've checked out these two posts:

[How do you build a portfolio without professional or intern experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mg026/how_do_you_build_a_portfolio_without_professional/)

[How can I build a really good software portfolio for something like an internship over the next 6 months?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gjws9/how_can_i_build_a_really_good_software_portfolio/)

but honestly, the comments there went right over my head -.- I don't have the required skills to take up most of the advice there, either.

Also, I'm still figuring out what part of CS I would like to contribute to, be it web design, back end wed development, app development etc etc The sheer amount of choices have frozen me up a bit. :/ So, any advice on that would be highly appreciated as well! 

So, guys, if you wouldn't mind helping out a total new comer in your field, what would you suggest as a good place to start? And once I do grasp the basics of a language, what do I develop? How do I even start?? "
3pxmqg,2,2015-10-23,Can I apply for internships when I've already accepted full time elsewhere?,osyed8750,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pxmqg/can_i_apply_for_internships_when_ive_already/,"I interned at this company last summer, and they gave me a full time offer which I've accepted. I'm doing a masters degree and finish this semester. The start date is for full time is September of next year. 

I wanted to take some time off and do things like travel and other fun stuff but obviously I'm a recent grad so I can't just be on vacation for 9 months without a job. That's why I'm thinking about applying for internships, especially at bigger companies that have offices abroad (not in US) like Microsoft, Google, or even banks.  The company I've accepted with doesn't have interns at offices not in the US. This would be awesome for me because I could live in another country and get to do fun stuff because intern life is definitely easier than full time life. 

The issue is that 1) I don't know how my company would like it if i was interning elsewhere when I could have just started with them early.
2) I don't really think other companies would want to hire me as an intern if I already have a full time offer elsewhere. I'm not necessarily trying to convert an internship to full time position because I've already accepted my current offer and it's with a well renowned company so I don't want to renege.

So my questions are: How unethical would it be to apply to other places for internships (specifically for ones that are abroad)? Should I tell them that I have a full time offer elsewhere? If I do get an internship and take it, should I tell the current company I have an offer with?

Thanks for the help!"
3pxo8o,3,2015-10-23,Misleading Job,Acertaindeath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pxo8o/misleading_job/,"I tried searching through the archives here, and I'm not sure if I've found something that really describes this situation. This is a throwaway since one of my co-workers is on Reddit.

I went to school in the Midwest at a ""hyphen school."" Not one of the main campuses, but not the most remote one either. The computer science program was completely new, I was something like the third class to graduate. That being said, the program was not well constructed, and I didn't really learn much of value. Despite this, I was able to use my math minor to net myself an algorithm design internship.

I've been using Ruby on Rails for the past few years, and decided to seek a job doing Ruby on Rails development. I thought I struck a goldmine getting a Rails job in a city known for doing solely .Net development. I took the first offer I got, despite the fact that I would be making 20% less than the ""area standard"" with no benefits.

I've now been here for a year and haven't been put on a single web development project. I've been writing SQL statements for work and taking online CS classes during most of my day. There simply is no web development work for me at my job.

I've applied to plenty of jobs all over the country, even willing to take an unlivable pay-cut just to get experience. I've been rejected at each technical interview. I'm proud of my drive to keep learning and try to expand my skill-base, but I'm playing catch-up for my garbage degree and can't compare to any of the other candidates. It's amazing that some of my peers have even gotten jobs at major healthcare companies. They get ""Computer Science"" jobs* where they tweak CSS every once-in-a-while and seem to be okay with it. I'm a solo developer here with no work and no experience doing team development. I've made plenty of projects in my free time and hosted on GitHub that I think are relatively impressive, but each company wants me to do some sort of system programming or test which I'll usually pass but it won't be ""up to their standards."" It works, but they need more finesse or experience in implementation. It's incredibly disheartening to put in this effort to learn and expand, but it's not even up to snuff.

I'm thinking about selling off a lot of my possessions and trying to move in with a family member to do an internship for a bit, but most internships I've asked about are reserved for college students. I really don't know where to go from here, but I can't handle being miserable and doing nothing at my desk all day. I love(d) programming, and still do it in my free time and try to contribute to OSS when I can. What seems to be the next logical step? Do I search until I find a company without a technical interview?

I don't mean to give the wrong impression, but it's frustrating. Especially since I was hired on as a Rails developer and haven't yet done a rails project or had a team of experienced programmers to mentor me."

I'm 24 years old, and spent much of my ""prime"" university years travelling the world and working. I've spent the last year working service industry position and completely hate it, to be honest. I'm not a huge people person, and having to pretend to be everyone's friend is incredibly emotionally draining. 

I want to go back to school for Computer Science and Software Engineering at the top CS school in my country. I'm currently teaching myself python, and really enjoy it- I'd love to be able to make it a career. That being said- I have almost no experience in the field. I taught myself HTML when I was 9 (to trick out my neopets store) but that's the extent of my computer experience. I know how to troubleshoot problems etc, but I always saw myself going into the veterinary field (that ship has long sailed, however) and didn't really push myself into tech stuff (it also wasn't a ""girly"" enough hobby, according to my mother- but that's a whole other can of worms). 

My SO makes $35,000/year after taxes, and I will be getting no parental help (mother is fixed income), this qualifies me as Middle Income and I should be able to max out my student loans and get a student line of credit.

My first year classes will be taken at a community college before transferring to the larger, more esteemed university. I will be doing my best to get internships during the summer and saving some of that income for the rest of the year (am female, so likely will have a good chance at getting an internship and/or grants due to Women in CS funding). 

I already have some contacts within the software industry in my town, and my starting salary after coming out of school should be approximately $65-75,000, pretax. 

 I could take a 2 year degree at a local technical school- but my salary prospects would be much lower ($40,000 or less, pre tax- same as if I went in self taught with no degree), and I'm incredibly interested in the AI and Computational Intelligence classes the larger university offers.


Am I crazy to want to do this? I have almost no experience in the field, but the small amount of programming I've been doing has been incredibly rewarding and challenging. 

I just want a job where I can use my brain, solve problems and be left alone most of the time and programming seems to be that. 

edit- I do have a meeting with a Program Advisor at the community college on Monday to discuss my options. My high school grades were quite good (all high Bs, despite not applying myself at all in grade 12). I may need to take Calculus or precalculus before applying as I took the mainstream Math course as you need X amount of Provincially examinable courses to apply to university, and Calculus wasn't one of them."

One from a company where I did my internship over the summer and one from Epic which is known for using outdated technologies (VB/Cache).

The problem is that Epic is paying about $20k/year more plus $10k moving expenses and is located in a lower cost of living city and I really loved the first company that I worked at.

I'm afraid that if I choose money now that when I leave Epic I'll have no transferrable skills compared to the first company. Another problem is that I'm not sure I can negotiate with the first company anymore because I already accepted their offer.

Is it a good idea to start a career at Epic (any Ex-Epic devs here?) or should I try to negotiate with the company I already accepted an offer with?

3pytr4,8,2015-10-23,Alone,halleluhwah_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3pytr4/alone/,"	I'm posting this note desperately in the hope that there is someone else who will read it, really read it in the same way that I do. I can't tell you which bureau I work for, but you already know what we do. It's the sort of work that you realize probably goes on, but you don't want to be that person who admits to believing in it. Fringe science. X-Files. Warehouse 13. You know. My particular department is formally in charge of neuropsychology and bioinformatics, but in practice that doesn't cover even half the work that goes on here. 

	Anyway, we had finally taken the first step in figuring it out. The hard problem of consciousness, the mind-body problem, the soul, whatever terminology you prefer. Nobody else on earth knew it, but everything changed in May 2012. In a way, history ended that day. Short of proving the existence of God, there's really nothing that compares. I don't have time to get into specifics, but you have to understand that the brain itself is ultimately nothing but a sort of antenna or magnet. We don't fully understand what exactly it's receiving, but that's not what matters right now, which is the machine.

	It took forever to complete, and it was the culmination of everything that had ever preceded that moment. It had the potential to unlock the singularity, to end war, the whole works. It was a machine that could directly link two minds (it would almost certainly be possible to link three or four, but we haven't made it quite that far). The substance it operated on is unlike any we previously had the science to measure, understand, or even perceive. We call it aether, and we discovered it completely by accident while running routine neural imaging tests on our rhesus monkeys. Hopefully, I can explain more fully soon. But it was exactly what we didn't realize we'd been looking for: the soul, at least so far as it manifests in this realm, as a sort of cloud that surrounds and seems to pervade the physical mass of the brain.

	I volunteered to be the first human test subject. Eventually my intern, Sammy, joined me in order to make the calibration possible. We couldn't risk letting this information get out of the bureau, not yet. We performed every test imaginable, some that you really can't even imagine. You don't understand the technology we've built, or else that we've acquired over the years. There's so much you don't know, so much I want to tell you, whoever is reading this. But by the time the tests were completed, we were able to understand exactly how each mental state corresponded to the slightest change in the aether. And three years later, based solely on the tests we performed on myself and Sammy, the machine was completed. 

	Sammy was so young, and she wasn't just an intern, she was a close friend. The work we do, the secrecy... it brings two people together like nothing else. Even before we linked minds, we were family. My boyfriend, however much I loved him, could never understand me the way that Sammy did. He hadn't seen what I'd seen, couldn't know what I knew. 

         She wasn't there that morning, when the machine was finally finished. Donald stepped in for the final tests on the finished project. I knew what to expect when the helmets were placed over each of our heads and the switch was flipped. It's the feeling that everything has been vibrating ever so slightly up until this moment, and then suddenly it stops, a sort of stillness you've never experienced, and then a rush of nausea like when you're suddenly flipped upside down. And then the thoughts begin to come over.

	I didn't even ask where Sammy was. It wasn't unusual for our team to get sick. Something about the technology we pick up, it seems to make us all vulnerable to little viruses like the common cold. I was used to seeing my colleagues take sick leave; it was the way things were. It wouldn't have mattered if I'd asked. There was nothing I could do at that point, I'm sure. But God, I wish I could have saved her. More than anything else, I wish I wasn't alone in this.

	This was it. The helmet clicked into place. No penetration was necessary, no needles, just skin contact. Warm metal around the forehead. Almost too easy, you'd never guess what it was doing until they hit the switch. And then they did. It started. The stillness, the vertigo, and then... nothing.

	""Something's wrong,"" I said. My head was completely silent except for my own thoughts. My own thoughts, and the sound of static. I put pressure on my ears, testing the noise, and I determined that the static was a purely internal stimulus with no corresponding external event. We unhooked the helmets, double checked the settings, and locked them back into place. Steve hit the switch again, and Donald and I each braced ourselves. Again, nothing.

	I-- Oh god, I hear footsteps outside. I need to wrap this up. Please, if you're reading this, try to give me some indication that you really are. Not that any indication would be enough. There's no way to prove it short of using the machine, and I can't go back there. Not now. I need to find a new place to hide, I'll post again soon with any information I have. If I don't post again in the next few days.... I don't know what to tell you. Just forget everything you've read here. It'll be easier that way.

3pzt24,3,2015-10-24,Looking for advice - former .NET consultant with 1.5 years experience.,Artificer_V,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pzt24/looking_for_advice_former_net_consultant_with_15/,"For about 1.5 years, I have been working as a .NET Programmer/subcontractor for a tech consulting company based in the DC area and recently they have let me off their contract so I am currently looking for work on my own terms. I currently reside in St. Paul, Minnesota and I am looking for some .NET Developer jobs in or close to the Twin Cities area. My programming career has been thus far entirely through this consulting company (I prefer not to name them) and Iâve worked in job assignments in three states, not including time spent in the DC area for training.

Even though itâs really been about a week since I began looking, it hasnât been easy looking for positions other than those that ask for more than 2 years of experience or stress a lot of technologies I truly have no prior experience in. Iâve gotten mixed feedback (from former colleagues or otherwise) regarding whether to market myself as an entry-level developer or a junior level, so Iâve been searching for job postings for both. Google searches generally turn up postings on Indeed or Dice and Iâve applied for a good number so far but I canât help but wonder if there are better ways I could be actively searching. Directly applying to companies come to mind but I am new to the area and it's hard to tell who might be looking. Also for now I am looking in this area because I currently live with my fiancÃ©e who is employed in the area so searching for work elsewhere will come after I feel like Iâve exhausted my possibilities here.

I ask advice from anyone that may have some insight as to what else I could be doing to search for programming work. Should I look for internships as well? I loathe the thought of going through recruiters due to sour experiences with them in the past but I am still not sure if I should burn bridges with that method of job search.

If it helps, my professional experience has been in with Windows Applications (Windows Forms and WPF) and ASP.NET Web Applications with C#, MS SQL, Oracle, web services, WCF, XML, Telerik UI, and some JavaScript and CSS."

Junior in university in NYC. Did an internship at a fairly well know company (but not well known for technology) last summer in the MidWest, $27 an hour.

Move back to east coast and get a part time internship at a startup in NYC, $32 an hour. I am stupid and did not realize at the time that with the higher COL for NYC, I actually took about a 35% pay cut (cost of living calculators tell me 56k where I was in Midwest translates to about ~90k in NYC). 

I am planning on renegotiating my salary for the second semester/summer, asking for $42/hr on the basis that I was paid ~$42/hr equivalent in Midwest over the summer.

Some details:

* Startup is GV backed (along with a whole host of other big name VCs) so I don't think they have money problems.
* I am doing mobile dev, basically in a junior role to another mobile dev, but a significant portion of my code will end up in the app and it seems like I will end up having a pretty big impact on it
* I received a MacBook Pro and they seamless me lunch every day, besides this I receive no other compensation besides salary
* I work 25 hrs a week and go to university full time (in undergrad)

Some questions

* Is a $42/hr rate too high for a part time internship? I don't want to seem greedy with this startup, I would like to work there this summer (they have not made me an offer yet)
* Who exactly do I renegotiate my salary with? The startup is only 30 people, so there isn't really an HR. Do I renegotiate with the initial recruiter I contacted?
* are interns typically paid the same rate whether they work full time or part time? Should I be expecting less when taking a part time internship? Should I just try to renegotiate for the summer?
* did I just kind of fuck myself over here and there's not much I can do?

and any advice is greatly appreciated."

I looked through this sub and I see a lot of people saying take the big tech job first and use it as leverage for your future career and learn software best practices.

I worked at Facebook already as an intern a couple of times, and quite frankly I found the work to be pretty dull. And I imagine work at Google to be even more lumbering than Facebook. I was wondering if it's still a good idea for me to start off a full time career with something like Google/Facebook.

Is it that much more beneficial to have Google/Facebook as full time on your resume rather than just intern? Is there a lot of software best practices that you would learn as full time that you wouldn't as an intern at these companies?"

3q3c08,1,2015-10-24,Software Test Engineering Internship Interview - Help Prep!,ChemeCar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3q3c08/software_test_engineering_internship_interview/,"Hello reddit! I recently went got the final on-site interview for a big medical device company schedule for Monday afternoon. They are asking for an hour and half for the entire interview. I don't know what to expect but I think I'm gonna need a lot of prep work. 

About me: I am a Chemical Engineer with little/basic programming skills (Like high school and my intro computer classes). I was offer a initial interview because I was going to graduate in December (they were looking to hire someone quick) and I guess I killed that interview? They asked about my previous work experience (Assembler), expectation of a Software Test Engineer and finally, a question on how to ""Test"" a vendor machine. But I got invited to the on-site on the same phone call but now i'm expecting some technical questions.....

My question is: What should I know?! The internship description is very basic and asked to do OOP (my only clue to help, sorry). My friend gave me an assignment to make a TicTacToe game on java using 2D array, if/while/for statements and that's really it.

As a intern, what do you think I should know?
Thanks Reddit"

I donât remember the movieâs name, but it was about a boy who started chatting with a girl (who supposedly went to his school) online, and they decided to meet up after school the next day.  So while heâs waiting for the girl, a man who claims to be the girlâs father pulls up in his car saying his daughterâs at home and offers the boy a ride.  The boy actually gets in the car with the man and they start to drive away, but then the boy realizes he made a bad decision and jumps out of the car.  He then runs back toward the school, with the man driving his vehicle across the lawn after him.  The boy makes it inside the building, so the man eventually has to get out of his car and chase after him on foot.  He catches up to the boy and tackles him to the floor, where they struggle for a bit before police officers arrive and arrest the man (I forget how exactly the police officers were alerted).  One of the officers then tells the boy that the man doesnât have a daughter, and the boy is shocked to realize the âgirlâ who spoke with him online was this man all along.

At the part when the man and the boy are struggling on the floor, the boyâs on his back kicking his legs (and probably screaming or attempting to scream; that detail eludes me as well) while the manâs trying to subdue him.  The boyâs vulnerability at that part â contrary to how it was supposed to make me feel â ended up turning me onâ¦as in sexually aroused.  I realized then that I had pedophilic tendencies myself.  But I was still only 13 at the time, so I was wary about coming across to other people (especially potential sexual predators) as a target myself.  Consequently, Iâve tried repressing those aspects of myself that I found attractive when exhibited by others: swinging your legs or letting them dangle off the ground, showing visible enthusiasm/excitement, âlooking upâ to someone or putting all your trust in them.  Even stupid little things like letting your lips look moist, or leaving your mouth hanging open; anything that could be associated with naivetÃ© or appearing childlike.  Likewise, I tend to be attracted to guys who are shorter/younger than me and who generally act/look younger than they really are (yes, Iâm gay), but the attraction is usually coupled with a power trip or sense of âdominanceâ over the other guy.

Iâm 23 now, and although I know I donât need to worry about becoming a victim as much as I used to, I still feel somewhat vulnerable.  For instance, Iâm 5â10â, which some guys might still consider short, and Iâm not âbuiltâ because I hate exercising.  But more importantly, my insecurities (coupled with anxiety problems) have affected my social skills.  I donât show emotion that much when I talk to others and my voice is monotone.  Iâm reluctant to hang out with people to get to know them on a more personal level, and instead resort to being a creeper and stalking their social media accounts.  But especially, I donât feel enthusiastic or passionate about anything besides browsing the internet, playing video games, or being around my pets.  This last point hurts me because Iâm in an applied mathematics graduate program that requires me to complete an internship to graduate, and although math is my favorite school subject and I like solving math problems, itâs not something Iâd do in my free time.  But employers seem to only want people who are truly passionate about their field and genuinely interested in the companies they apply for, while all Iâm looking for is a job I like at least somewhat so I can earn money and make a living.

Most of the topics here ask for help with broader insecurities, but mine have several psychological layers behind them.  I do have a psychiatrist and I plan on discussing all this with him (finally) during my next appointment with him in early November.  In the meantime, do any of you happen to have advice on how to begin tackling my issues, or know a website (or some other source) that deals with this specific thing?

**DISCLAIMER**: I was never molested or raped as a child, and I have never acted on my tendencies to do anything illegal (nor do I ever intend to).  I know pedophilia and homosexuality arenât related, but I know Iâm both gay and have pedophilic thought patterns.  The age range of the people Iâm attracted to has generally increased as Iâve gotten older, but I believe my tendencies still affect who I find attractive and what I find attractive about them."

The problem is: five years without keeping up to date in programming is a century. It will be pretty hard to find a job right now.

On the bright side, I'm open even to internships, but I don't really know where to find them. There're a lot of IT job sites, but all of them are for higher posts. I even managed to find some job interviews, but bombed on all of them.

Undiagnosed, seeing PCP Mon for psychiatrist referral.",ishouldntbedoingthi1,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3q3tt4/just_another_personal_testimony_for_sharing_and/,"Age 33, undiagnosed. If I have ADHD, it has made a mess of my life and is threatening my current good situation.

I've always been a space cadet, always procrastinated, always pursued escapist and avoidant behaviors with unusual devotion, got frequent notes home from teachers that I needed to work on ""listening skills"". 

I was in seminary for 6 years to be a Catholic priest, but the downward spiral of procrastination-perfectionism-sleep-deprivation-stress-failure-shame, followed by some angry outbursts with people in charge of my internship, led to my being kicked out.

Then I tried teaching religion in a private high school, and was fired after two years of the same pattern. Failure to function - distress and isolation - anger and emotionality. That was when a counselor first suggested that I might have ADHD, but she could not diagnose, and then I had no insurance anymore. That was 6 years ago. I packed my things, moved to a different state, and tried a fresh start.

In that time, I got back on my feet. Did retail computer service, which was great because no grading or lesson planning; it was a very reactive line of work. I was good at the job, and quickly rose to supervisor level. Took meds for depression, which helped me build a thicker skin and not let bad thoughts run wild all the time. Met a girl in another state, transferred to that store location, fell in love, got married.

Then I got a ""real"" job - tech director at a small high school. Low paying and far away but they love me and the work is fun. They give me lots of freedom to pursue projects that are good for the school but also interesting for me. I have to teach classes (ugh, lesson planning and grading), but the bosses tend to look the other way when my stuff isn't turned in on time because they like what I do.

Fast forward to now. I have a son who's a toddler. Still at the same school, which is the longest I've worked for one place and not been fired. For a while I was saying things like, ""maybe I never had ADHD after all,"" or, ""maybe I have it a little but my wife keeps me on the straight and narrow.""

But there's trouble in paradise. 

1. My responsibilities at the school have increased past my ability to manage them.

2. The bosses are less tolerant now of my late lesson plans and grades.

3. I've brought the school's yearbook up to a quality rivaling bigger and wealthier schools, but the final editing task is murder on my motivation. Last year, the yearbook wasn't printed until January. Now, I'm not finished yet and it's end of october. Bosses not happy.

4. The wife is exhausted from having to shoulder the burden of all of the tasks she knows I'm bad at. She's also frustrated at the 12-hour work days and bringing work home that I've been doing to cope with all the responsibility and bad prioritizing. My son misses me. 

5. I never seriously exercised before, and I thought maybe I could ""cure"" my issues by introducing real exercise. I did Couch to 5k (shoutout to /r/c25k) and now run 5k 3x a week. Guess what? No difference in my problems, and it's just another thing that takes me away from home and family.

TL;DR - Going to talk to a psych. Probable ADHD problems are waging a war on the nice little life I'm building. I like encouragement. Encouragement is good."

3q4mgn,0,2015-10-25,"Stuck, confused, worried about the rest of my life as a CS undergraduate student...",Marbish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3q4mgn/stuck_confused_worried_about_the_rest_of_my_life/,"So I'm currently a junior at a 4-year university. I have no plans for graduate school (mostly because of the difficulty and more importantly the cost)


A bit of background info:


I love computer science. Pretty much everything about it. I learn new things everything about CS and computers in general every day. I started coding well before college (when I was in 6th grade or so) in something called Game Maker Language (GML) for the freeware tool Game Maker. To date, I've made some pretty cool stuff with it (fan-games, not Indie games because I don't have the talent to make my own resources). I stuck with GML for a while because anything more advanced than that was incredibly intimidating. As I grew up I became more and more passionate towards video games as well as game development. It's almost literally my dream now to become a game developer of some sort (programmer, designer, or musician ideally)


When I got to my first year of college I was in a completely unrelated (biomed sciences/prevet) major because I wanted to become a veterinarian. But after taking a year's worth of chemistry and biology classes, I decided it wasn't for me. So my sophomore year I switched to CPS.  So I'm now a year behind, making everything worse.

After taking my intro to java programming course, I liked it a lot more than biomed, so I stuck with it. I did decently in the class (B-). But my second semester of sophomore year is where it went straight to hell, with intro to data structures. I struggled so much with that class that it was insane. I had a professor that I hated, was unapproachable, very tough, etc. Me being an extremely reserved person wasn't helping anything, either It's not that I don't get Data Structures, but just that I struggle with them somewhat and that it takes longer to click, especially with the more advanced ones, notably generic DS in Java. Ended up just barely passing with a (C-).
On top of that, I took Discrete Math the same semester. Same scenario, only much more severe. I hated the living hell out of that class and it frustrated me to no end. I understood the more basic material but did terribly on the exams. I dropped it and received a W (for withdrawal) because I knew if I hadn't, then I would have failed. Really freaking hard. So now I still have to take that class again before I graduate. However, I should probably note that despite my hate for DM, I love everything ELSE about math (basically). Maths is actually my favorite subject, while CS is second. But I don't want to become a mathematician, because that's way too hard. :&lt;

Fast-forward to present-day: I have Object-Oriented programming with the same professor as Data Structures. And the same thing is happening over again, I have a C+ so far and I think that I'm going to fail... the only thing that is helping me is this group project and the homework assignments which I'm doing decently on.

I also do have an assembly language/alternative programming languages course and I'm learning C and C++ right now, with a much better professor (not that I'm implying that the professor is responsible for my grade) and I love it SOOOOO much more than my previous CPS classes. C and C++ is hard, but the prof goes slow and makes sure that the students understand it and I'm slowly getting the hang of things.... kind of.

I also currently have two Game Design classes (2D and 3D) and they're easily some of my most favorite courses I've ever taken since I've been to college. 

I'm also part of a Game Development and Design Club which I love as well.

I should mention that college is my only ""career"". I have never been employed and I have never had an internship before. I don't even have a resume because I don't know how to make one for CS. ;___;

My overall GPA isn't horrible (3.1-ish), but hopefully it'll go up since I have easy classes (sans that damned OOP course that's screwing me over)


So my main dilemma here is that I don't know if I'll make it in life once I graduate college. What if I don't become employed? Or at least some kind of paid-internship? I don't even think I have the necessary skills to be in those situations considering my crappy programming/collegiate experiences.... it's discouraging and horrible and depressing every time I think about it. Even though I've heard all sorts of promising things about CS ""It's amazing!"", ""great job outlook!"", ""super-duper high in demand"", ""people of your race (black) will get in for sure!"" 
But I just don't see it. People tell me not to worry but I worry anyway. I've talked to CS advisers multiple times but I still find myself stuck in an inescapable rut. 

How can I be successful when I can't even comprehend basic CS stuff like data structures very well?

I'm not worried about pay; as long as I'm able to afford my lifestyle -- which should be manageable, no spouse no kids -- around 55k is probably ideal. I'm just worried about me being ABLE to make a living with a CS career. Like, I can't even make a video game in java and I've already have 2 and a half Java programming classes... that only thing that I'm actually proficient in is Game Maker and that's not marketable....

3q51xf,8,2015-10-25,Would going to a less than stellar school handicap me?,NEET_Here,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3q51xf/would_going_to_a_less_than_stellar_school/,"Hey guys I'm in a huge conundrum right now. I'm studying at a community college right now and I am going to transfer to a university for the fall of 2016. I'm stuck between going to a decent CSU (San Jose, Cal Poly Pomona etc) and a school that has an amazing environment/culture Humboldt State. I currently live in San Diego california and I really don't like the suburbian culture that is rampant here and I went up to humboldt earlier this year with my best friend and it was fucking amazing. The fresh air, the scenery, the culture, everything was great. I was a bit disappointed by their CS program, but I feel like I can make up for that by putting in tons of effort doing personal projects and internships outside of the school since I believe there are summer internships that are available where I leave for the summer.

I can honestly say that growing up I had a huge deficiency in terms of socializing, mental health and physical health. At this point in my life I am really focusing on those things, as well as doing really well in school and I'd being healthy and active, as well as making friends (a useful skill) on top of my list of skills to improve and become good at. 

In terms of CS skills, I'm confident that I can learn anything really well regardless of what school I go to. Afterwards I can decide where I want to live or if I even want to stay somewhere permanently. I guess over the last few years I've become a huge outdoorsy person while also still loving coding/cs. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this, but I bike 1-2 hours every single day to school/work. I lift weights and do yoga multiple times a week and whenever I get the chance I'll hit the trails. This on top of doing school projects and my own coding projects as well, so I'm always busy but I like it. 

Can I get your guys' opinion?"

3q5wse,2,2015-10-25,Do thesis or take another class?,MsCrazyPants70,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3q5wse/do_thesis_or_take_another_class/,"I'm nearing the end of my masters at a small school. I don't have any real-world experience supporting my masters (or very little).  The school I go to rarely has people doing a Masters Thesis even though it's an option.  My focus is on datamining, big data, and databases.  The one skill I know I'm missing is the R programming language.  

I'm not sure which route would help me the most.  I could either 
1)  Take a course that would teach me the R programming language (mostly I'm using mapreduce, pig, hive).

2)  Take a course that just focuses on being a DBA (this would help me get a basic job as a DBA if can't do anything else).

3)  Do a Masters Thesis and just learn 1 and 2 a bit on my own.  The thesis would be related to something in data mining or big data (haven't picked a topic yet), and I wouldn't even officially start it until next fall, so I have until then to get a head start on research and such. 

Right now I'm just a tech support person wanting to move into something more challenging with better pay and room to move up, but my moving options are limited since I have a significant other to think about.  I know he'll refuse anything in California, Florida, or where it's really cold. 

I can't do an internship on this unless it was moving to real employment, because I'm stuck in a house mortgage that I have to pay.  I've been paying for school out of pocket, so savings is pretty much gone now.  Plus, I did 2 internships as part of my AAS years ago - one where I was programming and the other where I was a full systems administrator.  

The final strike against me is that I'm 45 years old.  Most of the people I talk to these days about IT are half my age, and I'm cool with that, but I doubt they'd see me as a fit with a young team.  I certainly never pull the ""I know better because I'm older"" think that I see some others do (that shit drives me crazy when I see others do it).  But, someone else a few years ago told me, ""If you were going to do anything impressive in life, you would have done it by now,"" which essentially told me that there's an expiration date of 40. 

I'm thinking the thesis would look much more impressive than just another class, and that maybe over the summer I should pick up a bit of R. 

**So, here's the real question:
If you were an employer, would you be more likely to consider me with a thesis, or would that mean absolutely nothing, since I'm not going to be teaching at a university?**

Interesting problem for me though, they want me to tell them what I want to be paid and have not offered any amount.

They are a small business with only about 30 employees and they are only starting to get interns this year.

Any ideas on what I should make as an ""offer"" for my own hourly payment? I want to make sure that I can pay for everything, but I don't want to offer a super high amount that makes them change their mind.

They said they need to know by Wednesday.

If any more information is needed, please let me know. I'm not sure what to put here and I don't want to put too much.

**UPDATE**

I received a call this morning and after some discussion they offered me $22 an hour. I'm just short of full time (35 hours or so) the next two months until the new year and starting in January I'll be looking at 20-25 depending on school. I can work more if my second semester allows me to.

Thank you all for all the little tidbits. It helped me create a plan of attack so to speak and through negotiating I actually raised them up from their initial offer of $18 an hour. I pushed for $25 an hour and we met in the middle.

Extremely excited as this solves many of my current financial woes.

THANK YOU!",Thanks_Nerds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3q7re4/21_gpa_noncs_major_no_internship_experience_just/,"Hey guys and gals. I just wanted to express my sincere thanks for being such an active and approachable community. I'm using a throwaway at the moment, but I've posted multiple times here looking for advice and everything I've gotten has been productive and has led me in a good direction. Even without posting, the archive of information available here is extremely useful and I'd have been lost without it.

I'm a senior at a target university, majoring in biology, and have no internship experience whatsoever. I've always been really scared to apply for anything CS-related because of my GPA and major. Software development is my passion, but I don't have the numbers or the formal training and so I've always been very discouraged. This was my first stab at the application process, and I was completely lost.

Over the past month and a half I've gone from 
    
    Clueless about how to construct my resume -&gt;
      Nervous about interacting with career fair recruiters -&gt;
        Crazy scared for my first technical interview -&gt;
          Anxious about the on-site interview process -&gt;
            Literally shaking as I waited for final round results
and today I finally heard back from the very first company I interviewed with! Ngl, I broke down and cried after hanging up with the recruiter. For years I've told myself that my plan for graduation is to continue my job as a fast food manager, using my spare time to program, and eventually build enough skills to be employable. To have received an offer at all is a blessing, but the fact that it's such a great offer with a great mid-sized startup that I'm actually passionate about is unbelievable.

I've obsessively reached out to this community and its collection of advice throughout every step of that process above, and I have no reservations in saying that I would not be anywhere near as prepared as I was if you guys weren't here to guide me.

I'm not sure how common these sorts of threads are, or whether  they're viewed favorably, but I felt like I had a responsibility to share my experience and say thank you. So, **thank you**."
3q7vsa,23,2015-10-25,My debt is killing me,cherrycherrycola,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3q7vsa/my_debt_is_killing_me/,"I can't anymore.

Next month begins my student loan repayment. I can't get out of it or get the payment lowered. It's $600/month. My car loan is $200/month. My rent is $440/month. None of that includes food, Internet, gas, or utilities.

Right now, my job pays me about $600/month.

I owe the IRS. (When I called to set up a payment plan, they told me literally to ""sell my assets"" and borrow money. What assets?) 
I'm behind on parking tickets that I didn't pay when I *had* money. I'm behind on utilities. My Internet is the only thing that keeps me sane, and I'm going to lose it soon. It's also required for my job that I currently have.

Everything that I can't handle right now could be fixed with *money*, and it sucks.

I can't find a job. I did everything like I was supposed to. I got straight As in high school, I got a full ride to university, I did an internship for two years. I keep getting interviews, but I keep getting passed on. I've been yelled at by HR managers or whoever is in charge of hiring people for doing a phone follow-up when there's ""over 200 resumes on my desk right now."" The only job I can get is one that pays $9/hour, and I'll still be swimming in debt and that may cover my student loans and car note. I've been misled. I tried to do things the ""right way.""

I haven't seen my friends in weeks because they want to go out to bars and things that cost money. I have zero money to my name. I'm isolated. If I'm going to kill myself, now's the best time to do it, frankly. I know they will miss me, and I know there will be plenty of people at my funeral, but I just don't see another way out of my financial situation. People will move on with their lives, just like I've seen with *my* own friends that have passed. After time, it makes you feel sad for a bit, sure, but you've moved on with your life. You still can live a happy life with a dead friend.

The debt goes away for my parents if I die. I don't understand. I'm literally going to be killed by my debt. If I can't pay the student loan, my parents are going to suffer because of it. They don't know how bad it really is. I don't like talking about money problems with anyone.

I'm terrified of being a burden. They deserve to finally be able to live for themselves, and they can't. They'll get enough money to pay for my funeral, and then they can move on. I know my mom will be devastated, but I'm pretty sure she'll be just a tiny bit relieved. They're struggling too, and I have to keep borrowing money just to pay for groceries until my food stamps gets approved/denied.

I don't want handouts or a fundraiser or anything like that. I just want a job to be able to pay my bills and live without constantly crying and hiding bills under mountains of papers. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this to my parents anymore."

I am applying to master's programs in Electrical Engineering. Thanks! (Sorry about the funky formatting)

As climate change moves from the periphery of public consciousness to a tangible threat to cities around the     world,we will have to adopt new technologies to mitigate its effects. Electrical Engineering will make important     contributions in several areas, including transportation and the designing of a smarter electrical grid. Due to my     strong desire to contribute to progress in the energy sector through engineering, I am applying to the Electrical  Engineering graduate program at the XXXXXXX in order to earn a Masterâs of Science with an emphasis in circuit     design. I hope to build on my undergraduate education to become a more effective engineer in the lab and in     industry.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I completed my undergraduate degree at Boston University, earning a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical   Engineering. While there I studied a variety of subjects, including Power Electronics, Digital Design, and Digital   Signal Processing. For my senior Capstone project, I worked with a team to design and build a portable system for   an Epinephrine Auto Injector to contact emergency services when used, a project that won a Societal Impact   Capstone Project award. The project presented several challenges, including ensuring the longevity of the battery   supply and interfacing with a GSM module to complete the call. In addition to my coursework, I also worked   several jobs while achieving Dean's List Honors.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to my internship experience, since graduation I have been employed at XXXXXXXX, a semiconductor company specializing in hall-effect magnetic sensors. While at XXXXXX, I have been designing the systems and test scripts for the automated test equipment to test sensor parts at production scale, in both wafer probe and final package. I have also conducted simulations modeling a new magnetic coil design, improved several test methods, and have worked to transfer existing projects to new hardware. As my first engineering job   out of college, it has been an excellent opportunity to learn and grow as a professional. I enjoy the interconnect of   software and hardware that is integral to my position, and the challenge of debugging problems with both   simultaneously. With nearly two years of industry experience, my expanded knowledge of circuit analysis and   software design provides me with the necessary background to design and utilize equipment in academic and   industrial research.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

In applying to graduate school, I have considered the reasons and motivations that first drew me to electrical     engineering. Although engineering is primarily a technical discipline, it is increasingly important to consider the  societal impact of our engineering systems. With this in mind, I am determined to pursue a master's degree at  XXXXXXX to augment my skills as an Electrical Engineer, with the hope of contributing towards progress in     renewable energy. I am very interested in contributing my skills in an academic research setting, and am  especially interested in the self cleaning solar panel study being conducted by Dr. XXXXXXX and Dr. XXXXXX. I  feel that the research aligns closely with my interests, but I am also interested in the visible spectrum   communications research at the XXXXXXXX.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

After two years working in industry, I have gained valuable experience while taking time to reassess where I   want to go in my engineering career. After completing a master's degree in Electrical Engineering, I plan to   pursue a career in research and development within industry in the area of renewable energy. Through my   undergraduate education, internships, and industry experience, I have built an excellent foundation of knowledge   and determination that will ensure my success in research at the XXXXXXXXX. I look forward to furthering my   knowledge and exploring my passion for electrical engineering through your program, with the goal of making a   meaningful contribution in a field with important impacts on our global community.

However, based on my experience with Udacity and Codecademy's programs, I hate coding. It's not a career I want to pursue. I'd like to generate some passive income, and plan on doing some front end web development for my own entrepreneurial pursuits, but is this something that I should get into?

The question dealt with regex pattern matching.

The interviewer said its a ""somewhat easy"" problem before giving it to me. I communicated what I was doing consistently and clearly throughout the interview, getting a lot of agreement along the way. I ran into a couple issues with my algorithm not working with different inputs, and I then decided to change my algorithm from iterative to recursive.

Anyways, the interviewer said I was ""on the right track"" but that we were running out of time. 

Did I bomb it, considering she said early on that the question was a relatively easy one? Or did my other successes (communication, clean code, good explanation of my algorithm before she said ""ok good, now can you put it in code?"") keep me in the running?

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Here was the question: Given a pattern string and an input string, see if the input string matches the pattern string. For example, if the pattern is abcde\*f, and '\*' can represent any number of characters, abcdeeeffddaf matches the pattern. Also, '.' represents any single character.

I finished the algorithm, but didn't account for the fact that the \* can include the ""stop"" character but it really shouldn't stop. In the previous example, my iterative algorithm would have stopped at the first 'f'. My idea of switching to recursion involved, when you hit a \*, run through the rest of the string and call the recursive function every time you hit the ""stop"" character."

3q932t,471,2015-10-26,Encouragement for all those learning to code: my story,biffbiffson,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3q932t/encouragement_for_all_those_learning_to_code_my/,"If you would have told me 4 months ago that I would be programming C, Swift and Perl this last week, I wouldn't have believed you. I'm no pro by any means, but here's my story.

&amp;nbsp;

About 4 years ago I started the Python course on Codecademy because a colleague suggested learning Python when I mentioned I wanted to learn how to program. Codecademy was very frustrating and I felt lost often. I tried a Coursera course about Python, but it used its own customized library, and I couldn't differentiate ""real"" Python from the library. I found this confusing and frustrated. I didn't finish the rock, paper scissors project or course. I rarely touched programming for next couple of years, feeling extremely discouraged.

&amp;nbsp;

While applying for jobs at the beginning of 2015 I decided I wanted to upgrade my technical skillset. Having worked at help desks in the past, and building my own computers and such for many years, I decided I wanted to learn how to program - seriously this time. 

&amp;nbsp;

At first this year, I wanted to actually learn how to create websites. I knew HTML from my time on the web, but not CSS. I didn't understand how CSS worked at all. I started Codecademy again. After starting to understand that the frustration I felt while programming Python was somewhat normal when learning, the frustration began to fade, and learning began to set in. I finished the Python course.

&amp;nbsp;

From March to July of 2015 I was working a crappy job that I hated. I was hired because ""JavaScript"" was on my resume. I knew how to do JavaScript Injections and Console.log(""Hello, world""); and I put it on my resume. I explained to my employer how much I knew, and they hired me as a JavaScript developer in training. They wanted someone who hadn't learned ""bad habits yet"". I looked at the code and had no idea what was going on. I was sitting on a help desk answering phones and I was supposed to study the code base at home. Something smelled fishy.

&amp;nbsp;

I completed the JavaScript course on Codecademy while taking phone calls at work. The job was getting old.

&amp;nbsp;

Unsure of how to REALLY combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS, I swallowed my pride and bought a ""HTML5 &amp; CSS3 for Dummies"" book by Andy Harris. Boy, did I underestimate what these Dummies books were all about. This book wasn't just HTML5 and CSS3. It was about 1000 pages. It started with HTML5 then CSS3. That was the first 200 pages or less. Next was JavaScript. Then I learned PHP. I completed the Codecademy PHP course. The book told me about this thing I had heard about called ""MySQL"". I found free web hosting at 000webhost.com and Freehostia.com - Freehostia blew 000webhost away as far as a free service - other than having to have a not .tk or other Freenom domain name on Freehostia. For like $3 I bought a domain name and started writing live PHP in my HTML with CSS. I read this book during my downtime at work and built sites at work as well. I now look to Dummies books every time I want to learn something.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to go back to college. I got CompTIA A+ certified and started school. I learned WordPress at work and built a few sites. When I noticed that WordPress templates were written with PHP, I felt good about having learned PHP already.

&amp;nbsp;

I completed the jQuery Codecademy course at the office.

&amp;nbsp;

A few more weeks at the crappy help desk and I began to find that it was a waste of time. I could spend my time programming and studying instead, graduate quickly and find a job I love. I discovered The Odin Project. I became Network+ certified. Having talked with my partner, we both decided that if my side of the finances were in order, quitting my full-time job to study programming and graduate was in the cards. I left work one day and never went back. 

&amp;nbsp;

I continued with school. I had to take a Python programming course. Good thing I already knew Python. I just got Security+ certified and I'm well on my way to graduating. I'm currently finishing my Java course.

&amp;nbsp;

I started and am currently working on completing The Odin Project. I completed the Ruby course on Codecademy. I completed the Rails course on Codecademy (not very good, IMO). I watched Codeschool videos to ACTUALLY learn Rails. I watched jQuery videos on Codeschool to further hone my skills. I just built a photo gallery website last month with jQuery that made me $300. It took me about 3 days.

&amp;nbsp;

I learned Drupal and built a few sites with it. I learned Joomla and I built a few sites with it. I found Dummies books at the library and burned through them. I picked up a Java book for my current course. Learning a new language was getting easier and easier. Java was different - definitely a challenge, but I welcomed it. I had begun using GitHub. I built some HearthStone mechanics in Ruby. I built an adventure game in Python - twice. OOP seemed difficult, but it was easier now.

&amp;nbsp;

I knew Ubuntu, but I wanted to be better with Linux. I watched command line tutorials on YouTube. I watched Perl scripting videos on YouTube. I setup a Rails VM and built a couple of simple Rails apps this week. I learned the basics of the Sinatra framework. I now have a dedicated Apache web server in house.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I'm finishing my Java course final project. Today I did the new Java Codecademy course in probably 15-20 minutes. A couple weeks ago I didn't know how to println in Java. 

&amp;nbsp;

I started learning C via Derek Banas YouTube videos. I started learning Swift via Derek Banas. I have his Objective-C, C++ and C# tutorials opened.

&amp;nbsp;

In the last 4 months I've done more than I think I've done in my entire life - and I've enjoyed it. I study 10-12 hours a day, 7 days a week and work part-time either making websites or working on another contract I have picked up. I'm not a master of any of the languages I have learned, but it feels good, man. I want to keep learning, keep getting better. I'm still building the foundations. I've built websites, web applications, small applications and now I'm applying for a Software Engineer Internship.

&amp;nbsp;

All of that to say, if I did it - you can. It was four years in the making, but I finally kicked myself in the ass and have done more in four months than I did in those four years. I hope my story has encouraged you, and I hope you are pumped to program. When I don't have the motivation to code, I come to /r/learnprogramming and read questions that I don't know how to answer. Then I get excited. I start hacking away, I open tab after tab and I think I need a new keyboard already from all of the Google searches.

&amp;nbsp;

**Side note/Software suggestions/Productivity hacks**: 

I use Teamviewer to remote into my home server GUI, Notepad++ to quickly connect to my remote servers and edit/add/remove files, and my new favorite piece of software, Synergy, to allow my PC mouse to drag over to the iMac next to my PC monitors and use my PC keyboard and mouse there to easily develop C or in XCode.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Four years ago, I wished I could program. In four months, I learned several languages and I am learning more and more everyday. If I did it, you can. Take pride in the small victories and kick a little ass each day - even if that ass is your own.

&amp;nbsp;

**If anyone has read this far, I also have a question:**

&amp;nbsp;

How can I spot/learn the differences (other than syntax) between languages? I understand scripting languages vs programming languages, I mean how do you learn the different ways, say, Java code is used vs C when building applications? Or is that just preference? Just trying to take it to the next level of understanding. Thanks for the help!

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Wow, this kinda blew up over night. I didn't expect anyone to give a crap about my story, so I am really glad I helped. I will do my best today to go through a reply to everyone. **Also, I did read Learn Python the Hard way by Zed Shaw throughout the first few months of this year - this also helped me understand code a lot better. Zed also has a Ruby book, C book, SQL and I think even more all for free online.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit2:** I've spend the last hour and a half replying to all the comments everyone left. Thank you everyone for your input, suggestions and questions. You've all encouraged me for the day in return and I'm off to study and get some work done. Keep up the hard work!

**Edit3:** Another great source of motivation for me, since a lot of people asked about how to stay motivated, is I look to works that I like as inspiration. Lately, I've been reading Neuromancer by William Gibson and playing the Shadowrun Returns video game. Both of these science fiction worlds are about hacking and being a computer wizard. Things like the Matrix or even the movie Hackers inspire me to be one those (what I think of as) cool people typing away at a terminal. Live out your scifi fantasy IRL.

**Edit4:** Just to clarify, some people have asked if I went ""back to school"" for a graduate program or what. I returned to school to actually get my bachelor's degree. I have yet to graduate from any college. I took courses at other schools but never finished."
3q9e3u,6,2015-10-26,Here is my SOP to apply to Berkeley and I would like to hear your feedback. Thanks,Ooker777,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3q9e3u/here_is_my_sop_to_apply_to_berkeley_and_i_would/,"#What I have done
My dissertation in university is about the electrostatic binding energy inside the HIV-1 virus and when it binds to the lopinavir drug. We chose to examine HIV because there are many pioneers on this topic, so that I could learn from them; but still affordable drugs are not yet available, which means that there is still the potential for another discovery. The reason HIV can resist drugs so easily is because it can mutate so quickly. In the initial proposal, my advisor only asked me to work on the virus solely because it was ideal for an undergraduate student. However, after examining it in further detail, I found that most researchers were only focused on the interactions between the virus and drugs. Therefore I asked to broaden the subject, and he agreed. In our research, we used the Poisson â Boltzmann equation to compute and compare the electrostatic interaction energies between a drug named lopinavir and the mutants of HIV. The result of the dissertation will help to make a better drug to cure HIV/AIDS since it shows which mutants of HIV has the best resistance against the drugs we tested. This was written into a paper and submitted to a conference. The poster attracted much interest.

But my research experience isn't limited to my time at university. I have conducted my own resaerch in high school. The research is in linguistics, about the reason why Vietnamese people change how they address each other when they are in relationship. In my research, I had proposed an explanation based on the sociobiological knowledge about sexes and genders. Two linguists have read this work and left positive feedback. I plan to complete this work and publish it in a linguistics journal before going to grad school.

#The preparation to what I will do
As you can see, I can work well in many areas. But having so many interests does not necessarily equate to spreading myself too thin. It is true that at graduate level, you need to concentrate on a specific subject, however, in some particular fields, especially in interdisciplinary sciences, it is crucial to have knowledge in many aspects. One such science is ecology.

Unlike physics, ecology is holistic. Before going to university, I had determined that I will study physics, so that I could gain solid knowledge of the root of nature. After that, I will apply it to the real world, which is much more diverse and complex. Physics is like a guiding star; it is not enough to explain the world solely by it, but it will be an efficient tool to check if you are going down the wrong route.

To fully elaborate why I want to pursue ecology is lengthy, so I have written it separately on my website (link provided at the bottom). Now, to make sure that I won't be overwhelmed in the transition, I have applied to a research internship provided by Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. The lab I will work for is the Economo Lab, in the biodiversity and biocomplexity unit. OIST is a great place, it is an interdisciplinary and international graduate university and research institute, and so is Berkeley. Since the research interest of the lab is closely related to my research in Berkeley, I believe that when the first semester comes, I will have enough knowledge to start work right away. 

(I have also attended a three day field trip about the Mekong Deltaâs wetland ecosystem, organized by Cáº§n ThÆ¡ University, the flagship university about social and economical sciences in South Vietnam. Before the internship, I will apply for an one week program in ecology. It will be funded by the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation for international academians.)

My next step after graduating is to work in a multidiscipline institute like Santa Fe, perhaps in the energy-related field. We are on the cusp of sending man to Mars, yet here on Earth, there are still areas where electricity is not available.

#What I will do in Berkeley
I have researched carefully only to find that the questions that Harte Lab in Department of Environment Science, Policy and Management are trying to answer precisely what I have been intrigued about for so long.

I have read some of the most recent and commonly cited papers of Professor Harte. The first one is On theory in ecology written in 2014, collaborating with a group of scientists in Santa Fe. Among the introduced methods, I had the most interest with MaxEnt. Then I moved on to his next important paper, Maximum information entropy: a foundation for ecological theory, written with Erica Newman. The introduction on Quanta Magazine gave me a lot of insight. I know that he wants to find out when the method works and when it doesn't. It doesn't work when the ecosystem has rapid changes, but he can't explain why.

The changing of the ecosystem might (or must?) suggest that the energy flow of the system changes too. This leads us back to the entropy of thermodynamics. So here is my proposal should I have a chance to work with him: is there a relationship between the entropy of information and the entropy of thermodynamics in such ecosystem? And if yes, what is it?

I have contacted him, and within an hour I got his reply: âYou would be a terrific addition to our group!â. He said that I'm âcorrect that more insight is needed on the relation between thermodynamic and information-theoretic entropyâ. The lab is currently working to formulate a dynamic MaxEnt theory. He sent me a paper he wrote with his student, Yu Zhang, to illustrate one of the approaches. I have suggested some ways to expand the work during my discussions with the professor.

&amp;nbsp;

If I get admitted, I will be a valuable asset to the lab, the department, and the university. The lab will have a new researcher with a fresh, but no less compelling plan to work. The department will have a new student who can enrich the diversity of Our Environment. The university will have a future scientist working to accomplish its vision: create a better world.

I dont know what i want in my life,ricewilco,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3q9ev9/19_male_two_days_till_exam_but_confused_i_dont/,"my parents earn less than 30k per year so I thought I would attend uni major in accounting/finance( cuz CA(its CPA is CA in New Zealand) only for money and stability of job, mainly i was sick with me our family struggling with money.

Back in high school i was so obsessed with money. So my set goal was get everything as high grade as I can and get an internship at the second year.

First semester I worked really hard. I pushed myself so hard but still got average grade. but now its second semester and I dont wanna experience the whole process and I slacked so much... now its 2 days near the exam and I have studied some, but I know its not up to my expectation.....

and always near the exam i always fantasize about choosing career as an artist. I think its my way of generalising not to study for exams. During high school I really enjoyed playing in a band of my own, and was in big band for school(had to give up within a month thou cuz my parents being asian they wanted me to study) and really enjoyed making own songs. I remember it was the only time i was actually passionate about something. Creating amazing album of my own was always my dream. Although i gave up on it cuz i knew music was not going to make money( or more like i dont trust myself + there was no guarantee it was going to make money and I want our tough financial circumstances to be over quickly)

Been to accounting firms, they are really nice but everyone's really uptight and i do not know whether i would enjoy myself being an accountant. I always try to motivate myself that accounting can help other people, but this semester i am both physically and emotionally worn out i do not want to experience the whole process.

I know i am lazy and naive, and i am already 19 and i do not take full responsibility of myself...(plus i dont really trust myself. near the exam i always remind me you will never gonna do this multiple times. Exam times are so stressful. But then i know everyone go through the same. But then i dont want to experience this. I am too naive)

I dont know whether anyone could help me out with this thou. I am probably wasting my time doing other things before the exam...

Iâm a Senor in Computer Science, graduating this December, I recently started applying for jobs and have had good success with securing multiple interviews. My GPA is on the low end at 3.27 but I do have a lot of internship experience and personal projects that I have used to help stand out. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the company Brighterbrain? I was recently contacted by a recruiter for a position as a software engineer, specifically .net and C# development. The apparently are a startup that contacts out developers. I have seen some fairly negative reviews on glassdoor and was wondering if anyone had any direct interaction with them. 
I did have a 1st technical interview with the company, which I did great at (problem was sorting data in a multidimensional array) and got confirmation for a final interview, from what I have seen about the company it has me nervous if I should continue or not or potentially seek opportunities elsewhere. 
Also anyone have advice for vetting a company to make sure itâs a good fit, im looking for some tips and tricks as I donât want to get stuck in a position that might not pan out. Where are some other places that I could try as im not at the very top of my class?

Thanks

3qal47,427,2015-10-26,I'm a psychiatrist at a hospital &amp; something happened,Orphanology,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3qal47/im_a_psychiatrist_at_a_hospital_something_happened/,"Do all stories have morals? If so, let the one for this story be this: don't look so closely. You might find what you wish you hadn't seen. 

I was an intern at a small hospital of moderate reputation in middle of nowhere Middle America when this story happened. An intern at a hospital, if you aren't aware, is a graduate of Med School before he or she becomes an official doctor. You apply to hospitals where you study under their physicians, work too many hours, and learn how to put theoretical knowledge into practice. It's like being a doctor with training wheels.

All the prestigious programs I had applied to and interviewed for had rejected me, which led me here, to Pines Valley Hospital. The area was remote, rural and low in population density which lent it the feel of constant, eerie isolation. Most of the area was forrest, surrounded in the extreme borders by farmlands lakes, with the nearest city of any decent size about a three hour drive away. 
******

I was the only psychiatry intern at the facility, which might have contributed to my excessive hours. If you're wondering, *psychiatrists* are the ones that prescribe medicine for crazy people, *psychologists* don't have a medical license and therefore can't prescribe. That's how I explain it if anyone ever asks, and yes, I do say crazy. I find it helps put people at ease. Nobody wants to feel that mental illness is routine. They want to think madness is a rare, strange current in the ocean in which we all swim. But that's not true. Any of us can become ill and require help â medication, therapy, etc â at any time. 

And maybe thinking someone is crazy is a better option than actually believing them. 
******
Dr. Tomas was my attending â the doctor I reported to. He wasn't the worst person who I worked under but he was certainly in the top five. No particular reason âjust demeaning. As such, I was pretty tense doing rounds that day. No matter what I did, I was convinced he would find some kind of error, another reason to call me ""Doctor Andrews"" in a hideously condescending manner. I tried to tell myself that he was just making me a better doctor.  I'm not sure if I believed it. 

We had a patient in Room 342 who had been admitted the previous night for the usual sort of things â paranoia, visual hallucinations, suicidal ideation. The suicide thing was what enabled the admission. If you tell a hospital you are going to kill yourself, they have to get you a bed. In higher density, more urban areas, this technique is used by individuals who simply don't have housing. Out here, in the middle of nowhere, homelessness is a less pressing, although still present, concern. 

The gentleman in room 342 was obviously not feigning psychiatric concerns for housing purposes. When I opened the door he was sitting cross legged in the middle of the bed, his eyes shining, staring at me with a fevered intensity. 

""Mr. Gresom? My name is Dr. Andrews and I'm here to see how you're feeling this morning.""

He said nothing. Just watched me.

""I'm told you've been having nightmares. Any last night?""

""They aren't nightmares,"" he said. His  voice was very low. Not a whisper, but almost. 

""What are they?""

""Are you going to help me? Because he's coming tonight.""

""How can we help you?""

""You can't. He'll be here. He's always here.""

""Is he here now?"" I asked. Against my better judgement, something about the conversation was unsettling. Hallucinations, particularly persecutory ones, can be disturbing but there was an edge to Mr. Gresom's voice that was grating. 

""Last night he was. Not now. He doesn't come out in the day.""

""Well, we can start you on medication that can help with some of the problems you're having â""

""I've been on medicine. It don't help. Nothing helps. He watches.""

""Why does he watch you?"" 

""Why does he watch you?"" He asked, suddenly smiling at me. He was missing several teeth. 

""He doesn't watch me,"" I said. The room felt very cold. 

""Oh really?""

That was all he said for the rest of the interview.

****

Later in my shift, I reviewed Gresom's chart. Whenever anyone comes in, some basic neuropsych testing is done â draw a clock from memory,  copy a sentence, draw a triangle and a square, etc. The attendant last night  always asked incoming psych patients to do the house-tree-person test, which Gresom had.

House-tree-person is exactly what it sounds like: draw a house then a tree then a person. Allegedly the drawings would then reveal inner facts, i.e. a non-Euclidean house suggests psychotic thinking, a dead tree implies depression, a figure without a face indicates alienation. 

Gresom draw all three images on the same paper. The house was a large block with colored in windows. No signs of life or family. Standard drawing of the isolated or depressed. The tree and person, however, were exactly the same. A long âimpossibly long âblack, smeary line with what almost seemed like vines or, perhaps, tentacles coming from both. 

At that point, I was paged and had to put aside the case for awhile.

******

In the evening, before I left for home, I was able to read his history. Nothing complex, just a feeling he was being watched by something. Gresom had also been at the hospital nine moths ago. He and a friend had been involved in a car accident. Both were drunk, but the friend was driving. Both claimed to have seen something before wrecking the car. Something in the woods. 

Out of curiosity, I looked to see if the friend had been admitted since. He had, two moths ago. 

He had committed suicide. 

******

I went home that night feeling troubled. There were less cars on the road and the rural, remote location made me feel isolated and lonely. And â *admit it* âscared. I took a Xanax with dinner and passed out shortly after, having closed all the blinds in my apartment, feeling foolish as I did so.

*****

When I arrived at the hospital the next morning, there was a concerned scene on the psych floor. A patient had killed himself. Gresom. 

""He choked himself to death with his own sheet,"" Rene, one of the nurses told me. 

""You can't choke yourself to death,"" I said. ""You'd pass out. That's why people hang themselves.""

""Well, that's what happened,"" she said. ""Unless you think someone choked him to death without anyone noticing.""

******

""Doctor Andrews? Did you have a question for me?"" Dr. Tomas looked at me with his cold fish eyes. He was just exiting a room and seemed repulsed to see me.

""Yes, I did. I'm sorry to interrupt,"" I spoke as I followed his unnaturally quick path down Hall Seven, ""but a patient I saw yesterday died, I understand?""

""They tend to do that in hospitals. Did you just notice that?""

""No, I just,"" God, I hated Dr Tomas, ""he was my patient. Greysom.""

""Oh yes,"" said Tomas. ""The suicide.""

""That's just it. He couldn't have committed suicide. You can't strangle yourself.""

""You'd be surprised what someone could do if they tried,"" he said. We had stopped in front of a door. His office. He was looking at me with a curious expression.

""You and I both know,"" I said, slowly, ""that can't happen.""

""Come on in,"" he said. We walked into his office. I sat in the uncomfortable chair in front of his enormous black desk. He settled across from me, nearly disappearing into a battered leather chair. ""You aren't from here, are you?""

""No. I'm not.""

""There's a legend here. About something that lives in the woods. The story goes that it looks like a tree, but it's not a tree, that it looks like a shadow, but it's not a shadow. You look like you've heard of this?""

""Not exactly,"" I said. The lamps in his office throbbed yellow in the permanent daytime of the hospital. ""It sounds like that Internet story. The one where the two girls tried to kill the other girl?""

""Slender Man. It does sound like that. But it isn't Slender Man. It's older. Far older than that.""

I could see the forests from the window. Huge old trees standing like dead men stretching themselves to God. 

""Why are you telling me ghost stories,  Dr. Tomas? I came to ask you about a dead patient and you're prattling on â""

""The thing in the woods killed him,"" Dr. Tomas said. ""It choked him to death with the sheets and left his body for us to find.""

""What are you talking about?"" My blood felt cold. I could see Gresom's haunted and doomed eyes staring at me. I could hear his low and desperate voice. 

""The video monitor in his room stopped working for two minutes and nineteen seconds. When it resumed filming, he was dead. Right before the camera went offline, you can see the door open. A shadow is at the edge of the frame. The patient begins to scream. The camera feed becomes distorted at that point.""

""So someone killed him in the hospital,"" I said, my voice raising in spite of myself. ""Someone murdered him, and you're blaming an Internet meme for it?""

""You're not from here,"" he said again, his small hands making a temple on his desk. ""You don't understand. This has happened at this hospital before. It will again. The Thing in the Woods follows some people. Sometimes it follows them and watches them for years. And then, in the end, they die. They all die.""

""How do you know?"" I was furious, outraged that someone could be telling me this and yet at the same time? I was horrified. 

""Because I've seen the haunted,"" he said, his sarcastic countenance wiped clean by fear and an almost religious seeming awe. ""I've seen the followed and I've tried to treat them. And I can't. I can't help them. Medicine doesn't work. Therapy doesn't work. ECT doesn't work. Why? Because that thing exists. And once it begins to see them, they are doomed.""

""Wait,"" I said, my heart beating. I felt panicked. ""What do you mean by 'begins to see them?' They see it, right?""

""I wondered,"" he said, his voice sounding far away, ""when I first began helping these people, what caused the monster to follow them. Why they would imagine such a thing. And then I thought, what if it wasn't them imagining the monster?""

""...what?"" I asked, slowly. I could feel my pulse. It felt slow, and strange.

""Why do you think a monster follows people?"" He leaned forward in his seat, his little lips pursed. ""It doesn't make any sense, does it? And then I realized: what if the monster follows the people because it's imagining the people? That the afflicted are hallucinations of the monster? And that the monster finally kills them to stop seeing them, to regain its sanity?""

""I, I... This doesn't make any sense.""

""Of course it does, Doctor Andrews,"" he drawled, slowly, cruelly. ""We humans think we're special, so perfect, so lucky. We aren't any of that. We aren't even real. We're hallucinations of some other being. All we are is a nightmare *it* has. We're just their symptoms.""

Outside, the trees blew in the breeze, their dead leaves falling down in the wind.

About me: 

- I was born in Mexico to a Spanish mom and Argentinian dad and am a first generation US college student. I lived in the Midwest for most my life, but spent 3 years in Singapore. I am fluent in Spanish (reading / writing / speaking / comprehension) and English. Do not need financial aid of any kind. 

ECs:

This is where I shine I guess. I am really into entrepreneurial ventures.  

-	Started my own business in 2013. Itâs called Solection and is registered as a LLC. I buy and resell limited edition sneakers. Iâve make about 2500 USD a month in revenue, 50% of which is profit. The most Iâve made off a single sneaker is close to 3000 USD. (solection.bigcartel.com) 
-	Started my own charity in 2013. I am an adult fan of LEGO or AFOL, and do a convention route every year. With a group of friends, I began a self-run charity. We use our own models and create instructions for them. We sell these instructions for a small amount and use the money to donate LEGO sets to Toys for Tots. We raised 78 USD in 2013, 159 USD in 2014, and have raised 256 USD so far this year. 
-	Member of the only marimba-only student led band in my state.  We play shows every weekend at public events. All out shows are free. Because of this band I have over 85+ service hours. 
-	Internship at small local sneaker store. Itâs a âsneaker boutiqueâ and sells high end and limited edition sneakers and clothing. I am a junior financial analyst there. 
-	Member of the Business Club, Beatles Club, Skateboard club, and as I said before, the schoolâs marimba band. 

School:

-	Attend an elite private school in the Midwest. We do not do ranking, but I am in the middle 50%. 
-	Spent second semester of my junior year at a semester school in Colorado. Combination of rigorous academics and outdoor leadership. Had a huge impact in my life and totally out of my comfort zone. 

Stats:

-	2010 on my SAT. 690 W 690 M630 10 on my Essay
-	GPA UW 3.3 (very rough freshmen year.)
-	AP Lit (5) AP Spanish (5) AP US history (3)

Other
-	Very strong essays and recommendations
-	Had a very good interview at USC and Colorado College
-	I know what youâre thinking with Dartmouth. 0% chance! The admission rep urged me to apply anyways and told me that my profile is very unique and sheâd love to see me in the ED pool. 

Schools:
USC,
Dartmouth (super reach),
Northeastern,
University of Denver,
University of Colorado Boulder,
Colorado College (great chance thanks to interview and semester school),
American University,
George Washington University,
Chapman University, and
Fordham University.

Sorry I know this is long! Very stressed about the whole process. Not sure what my strategy should be. My first choice is USC, with Dartmouth (super reach) and Colorado College not far behind. 

Many thanks!

I have just recently begun wanting to get a masters in CS but seeing as how throughout these 4 years, I thought i would just get a degree, graduate, and then work in industry, I hadn't done any sort of research and my GPA is only a 3.53.

I don't have any extracurriculars and I lack any sort of relationships with my professors because I go to a public school and I never went to office hours, so letters of rec are lacking as well.
I took the GRE. 162 V/165 Q/5 AWA. I really want to go to a good grad school for CS (like, I'm gunning for Princeton) so that I can specialize more in a field. I don't want to be a code monkey in industry. I honestly want a phD but I know that at this point, it's probably not a realistic goal. So I was thinking of delaying graduation for one more school term (until December 2016) so that I can get into summer REU research and have an opportunity for a good letter of rec + have research experience under my belt. Plus, since I wouldn't have to apply until next year, I'd have the rest of this academic year to get in close with my professors and lock down more letters. After that, I plan on getting an internship somehow while finishing up my last school term and after I graduate, hopefully retain my internship.

Is delaying graduation worth it? Is this plan risky? I don't want to do anything stupid just for the sake of getting into a better grad school. USC offers a decent Masters program and they don't require letters of rec in their application.

**TLDR; Should I delay graduation for a quarter so that I can get a summer research opportunity and gather letters of rec so I can plump up my grad school application? I really want to go to Princeton (their Masters program is fully funded and I've always wanted to live in the East Coast).**"

First of all, I am so glad this subreddit exists. From the posts I've read, you guys are so helpful. Thanks for all the resources.

**Purpose of this post:** I want to do Software Engineering. In college, I wanted to go into PM right out of college but realized I want to build some technical skills before I go into PM. 

A little about me:

* I live in the East Bay (near Berkeley, CA)

* I have 7 months of Software Product Management experience.

* I am a recent UC Berkeley graduate, class of 2015. 

* I graduated with a BA in Physics with Honors (GPA 3.83), Phi Beta Kappa. 
* I took 2 semester of introductory computer science courses in my senior year. 
* The first one was in Python on the fundamentals of programming. Two projects I built include a Plants vs. Zombies game and a Scheme interpreter
* The second one was in Java on Algorithms and Data Structures. Three projects I built include a text analysis tool, that tracked the popularity of words over time; a text search and completion algorithm involving Tries; and a mini-GitHub file management system built from complete scratch.

I have a game plan and would love your feedback. I was thinking of taking an [Udemy javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/#reviews), studying coding questions from Cracking the Coding Interview, and then applying to entry-level, intern, or co-op Software Engineering roles. I reason that I picked JavaScript is because, from what I've heard, it's high in demand and full stack. 

What do you guys think? Any advice on how I can approach this better? I will also answer any follow-up questions for more details in the comments. "

I am a year away from graduating with a bachelors in Computer Science. My GPA is very good and I had an internship this past summer at a large company, so I feel like my chances at finding a job when I graduate are pretty good.

The thing is, despite these things I really want to be self-employed. It's essentially my dream to work for myself, and I would like to use programming as my way of accomplishing that.

What I would like to do is write a web application (software-as-a-service type business) and make my money that way. I have web experience, as part of my internship I wrote a small web application and I also work as a part-time web programmer. 

But I still do not feel like I could confidently write a quality web application and monetize it.

I am deathly afraid of coding something that is not up to standard and could be hacked. I am also afraid that I just do not know enough yet to take on a real project. The experience I do have have been pieces of an over-all effort, I do not really understand the complete process from creating a website and server application to where I can host/publish them.

How would one person learn enough to create a reliable and more importantly safe web application.

Are there any books or courses I need to take?

Should I not try to do everything on my own and save some money to outsource development to other people (who would know more than me)?"

On November 4th I will be taking the GRE. I studied where ever I can and when ever I can for this exam. Picked a few graduate schools that don't require the GRE as a back up just for in case.


Wish I has the chance to study more. Taking 6 classes, working part time on M W F Sat and Sun 8+ hour shifts, and trying to finish my senior research project so I can graduate in the spring.


I am just focusing on the Verbal Reasoning and Writing to help me out since I want to join a Clinical Mental Health Program. Every program I looked at either doesnt need a GRE or just looks at English and Writing scores.


My teachers tell me not to bother with a PhD program since my college is a small commuter school that has little to no internship opportunities in Psychology. They tell me to focus on Masters program, then jump into a PhD program.


How are my academics?


Overall GPA: 3.39 of 4.00 It may drop .10 because this semester is killing me.


Psych GPA: 3.24 of 4.00 I have more B's than A's in my major which seems to look like shit at this point.


I have some volunteer work under my belt.


Apart of Psi Chi National Honors Society


Never failed a class at all


Based my senior Research on PTSD and Immersion Therapy which has never been done before at my school


So yeah... this is me so far. Many of my teachers tell me not to worry, but it's hard not to. I have classmates who openly gloat on their GPA's being anywhere from 3.8 to 4.0. Then you have them saying how worried they are of applying to graduate schools. Hell if they are worried, should I even bother applying?

One is specifically for IT related jobs or internships where I focus on my IT related qualifications and experience.

The other resume is for when I apply to generic jobs with hopes that I can get a part time job to stop the speedy exit of money from my bank account while I study at a university.

Unfortunately in 3 years of study (TAFE and Uni) and searching I have only gotten 3 interviews and one temporary kitchen hand job that lasted only for the busy period.

Is it the resume that's the problem?

I am currently working full time and going to school to complete my masters (CS at a CSU).  I only wanted this job to help pay for school and to get my foot in the door as a developer since I just received my bachelors last spring.  I develop software that handles claim information at this insurance solutions company.   I donât plan on sticking around here for long, I messed up my starting salary and am only receiving 57.5k (Located in SoCal). I expect a huge boost in salary after completing my masters. The problem I have with working here though is most of the software I am writing in is in Pascal and to add to that, all the code runs on an OpenVMS machine.  So basically a bunch of legacy software/technology from the early 90/80s. I am okay with working on legacy software to an extent BUT this is Pascalâ¦. This doesnât look good for future employers as no one really uses it anymore. I was told there was some C++ software to work on so thatâs why I took it.  However, this also entirely depends on if they assign it to me.

If it helps any, my last two internships were in Python and C/C++.  I also have a pretty big name employer for my last internship (JPL).

 So am I screwed for my next job if I they keep assigning me tasks in Pascal? If so, what should I do to remedy this?

 Also, could I still score a high salary (75K+) after I receive my masters even if my current salary is relatively low? Assuming I get a high GPA for my masters (3.7+). "

I've been lurking threads for a month or two. I fixed up my resume, submitted them to a few positions on my schools career site and scored an internship  but I've yet to start.

During the interview they basically told me they're looking for a junior system admin. I have no networking experience whatsoever, I didn't even start my A+ tests. I feel under qualified. The only relevant experience I posted on my resume was basically that I've built a few computers and and do some PC repairs every now and again, also I'm a CS student with a 3.5GPA. So I didn't lie in anyway. But this morning they offered me the position and very nice starting pay. I'm very nervous. How can I best prepare for this new internship so as not to let my new employer down?"
3qc7w9,1,2015-10-26,Stopped using ritalin as an experiment,PeterRoar,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3qc7w9/stopped_using_ritalin_as_an_experiment/,"I've been using methylfenidate for around 10 years. I used it during uni, always with the pattern of using it throughout the week and in the weekend (sometimes when I needed to work in the weekend or didn't need to work in the week I didn't take my meds) and this has worked great. Currently I'm in my graduation internship which is a 40 hours work week at a company.

Six weeks in, and I was getting curious how I would handle it without my meds. Also, I had a feeling the medication might not be for the best, as I read some stuff about the background of it. So (as a true ADHD person), I (impulsively) stopped using over the weekend and started to see what it could offer me. I'm aware that this might not be the best way to do this, but I haven't talked to a doctor about my meds in 3 years since I switched back from concerta to ADHD. The results have been interesting to me.

I've experienced a more free mind, that is allowed to wander more. This is great in spare time, but not always when I have to work. I have to force myself to work on something sometimes 10 times in a row, just like a car needs to run a few time to a hill to make it. So far, this is something I could live with as it gave me more satisfaction to achieve something. However, a general feeling of lack of productivity is very prominent, and a lack of overview (which used to be one of my great skills) combined with lack of motivation makes me question my general laziness. Was I only able to preform when I was on ritalin?

I've experienced to be more tired during the day. The 9 to 5 office space isn't very inspirational and a lack of focus is currently keeping me going in very tiny steps, it feels relaxed; just without a sense of direction. I feel like I could sleep during the day, that I could use a nap. I haven't experienced that in 10 years before. I started to wonder whether that is my body reacting to the absence of medication. I've gone without medication during holidays for two months, yet not a lot needed to be achieved in those days (which I didn't &amp; I loved it).

There are two stories to stopping with my medication. On one hand, I am better in touch with myself, yet my emotions are sometimes less stable. Not sure whether that is a reaction of my body to the absence of the meds or not. I like the fact that my mind feels like a free spirit, but it has some professional limitations for me.

I realise as I'm writing this that I should go to a doctor to talk about this, and will do this first thing in the morning. But for now I'm curious if any of you guys did something reckless like this and how you experienced this. Is this lack of productivity something that could go away? Should I maybe go back for now, to manage to keep my graduation on track.

TL;DR: Stopped using meds as experiment, experiencing positive effects in personal life but negative effects in professional life. "
3qcapq,1,2015-10-26,CSE and ChemE dual major. What to do?,sailoholic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qcapq/cse_and_cheme_dual_major_what_to_do/,"Hope this fits the subreddit:

Background. I'm 22, Junior (took a year off to travel before college), 3.9 GPA, Computer Engineering and ChemE dual major (already in both departments) at a top 10 university (for CSE at least, ChemE more around top 20). Work in a high-functioning research lab ~15 hours a week (first publication coming in month!). 

Came in to college thinking chemistry was all I wanted to do, I had always nerded out on it. Get here, and realize there's a lot more out there. Many faculty steered me towards ChemE on the basis that its chemistry + more math, harder degree, more applicable etc. So I switched from BioChem/Chem to ChemE. Then I took my first intro to Java class, and I fucking loved it. Its like a giant puzzle. Super fun. Anyways, I took another java course, did well in both, applied for CSE and got in. I may not have ever really considered it had it not been for my 3 other CSE major roommates, so hats off to them. 

Anyways, here I am, Junior year. I'm taking Thermo and Fluid Dynamics for ChemE and a discrete math/logic course for CSE. With current plans I'll graduate in 2.5 years (so about 4.5 years total). ChemE is being generous, and letting me count some CSE courses as ChemE electives if I present good reasons (why should ""data structures and algorithms"" count towards meeting ABET requirements in a ChemE program etc.). 

Now that that's aside, here's my current problem. CSE is sexy, fun, fast paced. ChemE is a grey dinosaur. I get excited more about my CSE work than I do for my transport/thermo courses. Maybe that will change once we get into higher level material, but right now I much prefer CSE. 

I've also become acutely aware lately that everything has an opportunity cost, and no, I cannot be an officer of a club, do 15 hours of research, dual major in engineering, be in the honors program, be in the entrepreneurship program, have friends, eat food, survive, etc.

So, I've cut out the fluff (that club wasn't doing much for me). But I still have a hefty load. My whole reason for dual majoring in ChemE and CSE is that I don't really know what I'm good at or where I'll take my career. I think I would be good at/interested in being on the business side of the STEM industry, and ChemE seems to be the most common degree (other than business) among C-level executives in fortune 500 STEM companies. Another interest is advanced design at an engineering firm (think SpaceX or Tesla, no fundamental research, but groundbreaking and fast paced)

I don't know if I'm cut out for academia, I don't know if I'm cut out for PhD level work. I'm not all that smart, I just work really hard. 

My fear is that I'm sacrificing too much time in school. I'm already a year behind my peers from my gap year, and at a worse case scenario if I take 5 years to graduate then I'm 2 years back. That's maybe ~200k (avg starting salary for graduates in CSE at my university is right around ~102k) and industry experience down the drain. 

So as it stands now, I can continue the dual major, or drop ChemE now and continue only in CSE. 
Pros:
-graduate faster
-focus more on CSE (less jack of all trades, more talented in CSE)
-more time to pursue other endeavors (engineering competitions, internships, etc.)
Cons:
-dual major in ChemE fairly unique
-I get 2x the scholarship money (about 5k from each dept this year)
-how many computer scientists understand physical sciences (answer: me and few of the neurobio-compsci dual majors)
-I may fit a unique niche that I haven't forseen
-flexibility in career choices

So, for those that haven't walked more steps than I have, let me know your thoughts.

TL;DR
I do too many activities. Are these activities worth it? Should I focus on less?

I am currently in the last semester of my degree (Business Information Systems), from a Connecticut State University and planning on finishing up with a 3.0 GPA.  I do not have a minor at this time, but have an Associate's in Computer Information Systems.  My initial plan was to major in CS, but had switched majors due to my interest in learning the business aspect of IT/IS.  The major also includes a decent amount of programming requirements as well (SQL, C++, Visual Basic, .NET, etc.), but not as in-depth as a CS major would include.  

I am curious to know if I had made a mistake in switching majors to BIS.  Also, would it be too late, or even worth it working on a double major in CS?  With my current credentials, I would like to be marketable to employers of CS and would like to eventually make a long-term career in programming and/or a CS related field.  Will my major/credentials make a difference in landing a decent job in the CS field?  This is including over 5 years of personal and professional work experience in programming.  Also, I am currently working within an internship relating to my BIS major.  "

It's a great environment and I'm learning a huge amount. However, sometimes I have a really hard time feeling productive while I'm there. My supervisor often assigns me difficult and research-heavy tasks that require an intimate knowledge of the code base that I simply do not have. I've only been here for a few months and have written basically none of it. It's a pretty large code base, and it's monolithic, to boot. I feel like most of my time is spent looking at exceptions and stack traces, looking them up, finding nothing, and basically just spinning my wheels until I eventually flounder my way to the solution. Luckily, on this most recent issue, I'm working on it with another employee who knows much more about the application, but he doesn't have a lot of time to work on it. I hate to bring him over constantly for questions. It wastes his time and means I'm doing less of the work.

Is this just how internships are? I have to admit, these issues do require me to grow up quickly and learn a lot, but I'm having a hard time staying motivated and I wonder if my supervisor expects me to be solving these problems more quickly. He hasn't told me that I'm falling behind, but who knows."

Now to the problem, my bosses assign me some relatively easy tasks. Of course they guide me before I start anything new but I can take care of these after they explain to me what to do. So because of this, I kinda finish everything very quickly and then have nothing to do during the rest of the day until someone assign me something new.

I'm looking for some advice/input/prognostications about my future career life. Really, I'm just anxious and want to know what I could expect to find out there in the world. 

**My background/story**: 

* B.A. English major/Ancient Greek minor

* Started off as a copywriter for a Fortune Global 50 corporation. Did marketing, sales support, branding, advertising, project management. Nothing amazingly high level, but I got my feet wet. 

* Then I went to law school for some damn reason. Did fine, got some As, proactively took on, argued, and won hearings and cases pro-bono and through internships. Internships were with government agencies and non-profits. 

* Had a nervous breakdown after I graduated, so instead of taking the bar I took a job in my old field while I got my head together. Since then I've been working as a copywriter for a Fortune 300 corporation, doing internet and ecommerce work. There are no gaps on my resume, I've been working/in school non-stop since I was 16. 

* Went to therapy and learned nervous breakdown was due to undiagnosed PTSD / major depression that I had been living with for most of my life. Apparently I lived with it for so long that I thought it was just how life normally was! Needless to say I had a pretty fucked up life growing up, and I only made it this far due to extreme persistence and a good ability to teach myself things.

* Anyway, after 3 years of hardcore therapy, I'm ready to start my life again. Having a career is one of the most important things to me in my life, but I'm 32, and my career trajectory is a little erratic. I really have no idea where my footing is anymore. I'm also aware that I'm getting older, windows have closed and are currently closing, and many people much younger than me have more experience/better credentials in whatever field I'd want to pursue, and not to mention my peers who are occupying higher level roles with a more seamless background. 


So, I guess what I'm asking here is, what are my realistic chances/opportunities right now as far as having a career goes? People say ""it's never too late!"" but then you read about age discrimination against people in their 40s. You know? 

Additional tips/advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

I'm the only co-op at the site right now. This is the first one I've ever been and coming in I didn't know what to expect. The position I'm in is to mold future full time engineers/ supervisors. Im working with people, on average, 10+ years older than me. But getting to the main point.

Normally I don't go out to lunch with my bosses as I bring my own lunch. They go out to lunch EVERY day and I don't like spending money like that. But I know if I want to get on good terms with them, I need to do some more socializing. So they invited me to lunch and I think ""You gotta go this time Zorion22"". My bosses, a few others, and myself are off and on our way to taco bell.

Once we have our food we sit down and have light conversation about several things. (sports, sports, and I think sports but not sure). Anwyays one of the bosses, lets say joebob, goes off to the bathroom. The other, joeshmo, didn't notice. When joeshmo looked up he said ""Oh where did joebob go?"" Now these guys share an office and have similar roles so they are always together, even outside of work from my understanding. Here comes the fuck up.

Me and my friends always call 2 close friends ""butt buddies""; guys or girls doesnt matter. It never had occurred to me that it had some... well deeper meaning. So without hesitation I say ""You miss your butt buddy already joeshmo?""

Immediately another person busts out laughing, with joeshmo having a light chuckle. Thinking that it was okay I continued on with the joke. Now no one is laughing. I immediately pick up on the atmosphere but the damage is done. I try to defend myself for my reasoning behind it, but it made it awkward. I apologized profusely and they said dont worry about it but just dont say it again. I still have another month and a half here....

Tl:dr went to lunch with employeers,made a comment on their friendship, has homo-sexual meeting."

Not sure if this is the right place, but can somebody please give me some feedback on my revised cover email? My CV has already been checked. 

I'm trying to get a school internship in the UK but so far my efforts have been in vain. I asked mainly by telephone but all declined and only 20% have sent an answer to my emails (I guess the silent ones are a ânoâ, too). Iâm getting mildly desperate here. My next plan is to increase the sample size and reach out to ~50 schools by email and then even more, but before I do that, I would like to ask if I could improve my cover email. (This is Draft A - if the schools offer German)


---------------

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a German student and recently started the 3rd year of a secondary school teaching degree in English and History at X University. I would like to ask if you offer (unpaid) internships or the opportunity to take part in teaching assistance activities. My studies require me to spend a minimum of three months abroad and I would greatly welcome the chance to experience teaching in an English-speaking environment.

While I would be very interested in gaining experience in teaching the English language or history, I could also assist in teaching German using my native speakerâs abilities. Additionally, I completed a training as IT specialist and could support in teaching computer science (e.g. C++, Java, MySQL or networking). Through previous internships and my work as a tutor I have already gained experience in teaching children and young adults.

A) For your consideration, I have attached a link to my CV and a letter of recommendation from one of my lecturers, Dr. NAME,  below:

Yours sincerely,

Part of my search ended up with me landing a part time internship at a company working with Apache Cordova, doing business app development. This is my first development internship, my previous jobs were in QA and helpdesk IT. My schoolwork, GPA, and personal projects have been pretty lackluster.

My question is should I pause my job search while I work this internship and then apply closer to my graduation date in May 2016? 

Currently I haven't been there long enough to have it be a good addition to my resume, but I feel like if I work there for several months and then start applying fresh to full time positions, I may get better feedback from companies I apply to.

Another question is when applying to jobs before graduation, would I be more likely to get better responses closer to graduation? I feel like employers would not want to wait as long now than if I were to apply 2-3 months before graduation.

Any feedback is appreciated."

So right now I am employed for a struggling company, doing QA work(mostly whitebox/Not manual). This is my first job out of college, and I did no internships during summers. Last Friday there were layoffs and that was the 3rd time in the 2 years I have been here. No one from engineering was laid off, but rumors are flying around saying another one is come in December, which could include us. Regardless if it comes or not I want to move out of here. 

I don't know if it's this job or QA, but I hate it QA. It's boring, repetitive and I feel I get a lot of shit from my manager if anything goes wrong. But I seem to have been pigeon holed into this role and I need advice on how to breakout. I have had two interviews this year for QA roles, one from Apple and another from a small startup in the bay area(Where I live.) I got rejected from both and that really has shaken my confidence. I have stopped applying elsewhere  simply because I do not want to do QA anymore. How can I break out of this situation I am in? I don't want to get laid off, because I keep hearing the job search will only get harder if I am unemployed. 

I do want to become a dev, something I shared my my manger at the beginning of the year, but nothing ever came of that. I have looked into android development and I have one small todo list app(very very basic) published. I have also looked in dev op/analytic job openings and that interests me too, but I have no experience with anything on those job descriptions. 

Does anyone have any advice for someone in my situation? I feel like I am running out of time and all I can think of to do is apply for more QA jobs. "

* Top 30 US school for undergrad - BS Physics/BA Mathematics/minor CS, decent grades
* Applied to many entry QA Engineer/Software Engineer/Data Science positions. Did well on phone interviews and brain teasers, but couldn't get past the actual coding stage of the interview process
* Currently working full-time as an analyst at a midsize company, sql/ssrs/data analysis, not too exciting, decent salary
* One semester of physics research experience during college (no bueno)
* Experiences all over the place (Law, engineering, finance)
* Want to go to grad school for CS (ML/AI)

That being said, I'm looking for advice on preparing myself for a career in CS. I must say, I'm in it for the fun as well as the money. Given that I don't have much research experience to show for, and that I don't necessarily know if I will enjoy research, it seems more reasonable to go for a masters  first (perhaps I'll pursue a PhD if all goes well). I'm mainly interested in knowing more about:

* How do I increase my chances of getting into a top graduate school? (Are research opportunities a possibility when I'm working full-time?)
* How do I know if I'm really interested in ML/AI? (I've read some papers, they're interesting)
* Should I look for a job that's more related to CS?
* Company offers and supports internal transfers, and there are many development positions open, but it'll take at least 2 years. What's better as far as future career goes (again, considering both fun and money): having a ""fresh start"" in the field by going to school and getting internships vs. climbing the company ladder
* Is working in the CS field really fun? Or am I just delusional (FYI, I loved the CS classes I took in college)

Everyone that I know has already had their Microsoft internship on-site interviews already. Most of them had their interviews two or three weeks ago, in fact.

Here's my position - I received notification that I was being considered for an on-site interview a few days ago, about a full month after I had went through the first on-campus interview. 

While I'm pretty happy about that (since I had all but given up hope), I'm concerned about how late the notice came. Additionally, the email said to please allow between 2-4 weeks for someone to email me and help set up a flight/hotel stay in Seattle.

Practically all of my friends had already interviewed onsite and either been accepted/rejected before I even got that first email. Given how late the email came, I'm fully expecting the flight plan to take another month to sort out, meaning I'll be flying out in late November.

I'm concerned because I feel like I'm losing my chance at a company that I'd really like to intern for. It seems like all of the interviews are going by very quickly, and all of the other candidates will have been evaluated by the time I finally get my chance. Will there even be a position open by the time I'm ready for the on-site? Is there even a point to interviewing so late when most of the spots will probably already be filled? Will the interviewers go into the interview with the mindset of ""Our team already has enough interns, we don't need another one""? What should I do?"

She will be working in the industriepark hochst and I will hopefully get an internship at the American Consulate in Frankfurt (weâre both Americans).  There are a few things that we are unsure about:

-Should we purchase bikes when we get there?  From what weâve heard, you can get around the city quite easily using public transport.  Would it also be useful to purchase a bike for getting from place to place as well?

-Are there any areas of Frankfurt to avoid trying to find housing in, or similarly are there any areas that are particularly nice to live in that are reasonably priced?  (Our housing budget is around 700 euros per month) Also, how do we securely send money for rent and security deposits online?  Is DepositGuard a reputable company/service?
-What should we make sure to do while we are there?

-Is there any other place in Frankfurt I should consider applying to for an internship if I am interested in working in the German government?

-What is the best international cell phone plan, or should we buy SIM cards when we get there? 


Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I've been told to apply for summer internships because they actually don't require much prior qualifications and can really help prepare you for post-graduation, which I was really excited to hear. So I've been applying left, right and center but recently I got to thinking, how on Earth would I pass any sort of technical interview with my knowledge. I'm about 2 months into my first C++ course and unix course and the extent of my knowledge ends around strings and arrays. I've been performing well in these classes and passing with flying colors. While my knowledge is growing rapidly and I am having an easy time understanding everything I've been taught, I only know so much, so I was wondering:

Do most employers tailor the technical phone screenings and interviews towards your resume (which in my case, states at I'm only moderately experienced)? Or would I be asked data structure and algorithms questions when I've never learned or claim to have learned a single thing about them?"

I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm about to graduate and have (at the moment) two main options for my first job. I do ""ok"" in class, have a tiny bit over a 3.0, and have had multiple internships. 

 My first option is to continue to work for my current company, a major financial institution, where I'm currently on their Mobile team. Eventually my work will see millions of users per day, which I think is really cool, and I find the work satisfying, but they have quite a few issues. First you are definitely a number there, just another resource. You only really have a very specific role, and are very tied down (being a financial institution), no admin rights on your dev machine, getting software takes a long time, etc. Additionally most of my co workers are contractors/consultants on temp jobs, and you never really get to have a ""core"" team that you can bond with. Ultimately I'm worried that this arrangement, while it doesn't bother me too much now, won't develop me as a programmer, and will leave me dissatisfied with my job day in and day out. They're offering me 63k + 5k sign on, typical benefits, and I'd be in a program that would guarantee me really good raises for two years (pending average to good performance reviews, I'd probably be like 80K-90K after two years). 

The other option is a young company that consistently gets top ratings in my city for being the best place to work. Their glassdoor is loaded with positive reviews, and have a very ""start up"" feel/culture. They're very profitable as they found a niche role that no one else is in (It's a pretty unique problem that they automate, it also does a lot of public good IMO). I had an all day interview with them recently, and during the interview I talked to multiple devs and general employees all of whom loved their jobs, and the general atmosphere was amazing. Coming from my financial company where everything is so slow paced, and most employees (and contractors) don't seem to care, this was a massive culture shock. Anyway I would accept their offer in a heart beat, but.... they'd put me into their co op program, which would put me at $22 an hour for up to 7 months (though I could pending performance move to a full dev position faster). The ballpark starting salary for a dev there was 65k and up. I would get benefits (very good benefits, so that is not a worry), and there is a potential for bonuses. I really like the company but the idea of being an intern again, and turning down quite a bit of money when I have debts to pay off is really hard for me. I'd also be losing out on any other future offers. 

I'm still interviewing with other companies, just had interviews with two of the big 4, and another financial institution. So I'm not entirely left with just these two.

For me, this comes down to a fundamental issue about what is most valuable to me. I've never considered myself money hungry, and I really want to work for the smaller company, but I also want to be sure that I'm making the right decisions both for me mentally, and also for my career. 

I waned to ask if anyone else had a similar situation? What did you do and do you think it was the right choice?

**TLDR: I'm a new grad, deciding between an awesome startup, but that will pay me a lot less and start me as an intern at first or a BIG financial institution that will pay me me more, but might not develop me as a programmer/leave me as happy. Thoughts?**"

This might be slightly off-topic, but I don't know where else to post this. 

I want to live my life. I want to have a nice stable job and property of my own (basically the American dream). I hate the competitiveness of college. Constantly comparing yourself to your peers on every single test grade, side project, and internship.

I want to look forward to something. But, I've read on this subreddit that maybe my vision of the future is not realistic at all for this field. Do software engineers have free time to spend with family or are they constantly on call? Is there competitiveness in the work place where you have to constantly compare yourself to your peers to make sure you're not performing ""poorly"" and can get fired arbitrarily for not performing ""up-to-standard""? Where you're treated like a code monkey--no respect at all from management/others?Just how secure is a CS degree? I feel like it's getting too saturated...

I hate college. I hate rigorously studying data structures and algorithms. I hate how the interviews are structured. I hate how much companies expect you to know.. EVEN FOR AN INTERNSHIP.

We discussed some of our projects that evening, he gave me his contact info and said we should meetup for lunch. 

I met John the following week and discussed what I had done during my investment banking internship and startups. He was impressed and told me about some of his companies and projects. Later that week he told me to look into a European company that he was purchasing distribution rights from. The company and their tech seemed very interesting, I asked if there was any way I could help. He asked me to forward him my resume and setup a lunch meeting to discuss my employment with him.

He offered to buy me a new laptop as mine was too old for Excel and we even discussed the potential of a trip to Europe in late October/early November to meet the parent company.  

On October 21st I was expecting my initial payment, when I didnât receive it by the 23rd I asked for an update and was told it would be set by the 26th as my employer had difficulty bringing over his international assets. According to him, he was restricted by how much of his money he could bring in from his projects abroad due to the risk of having his bank accounts frozen. Naively, I nodded my head and went along. He assured me there would be no issues with my payments but on October 27th he told me it could take a couple more days and that I should âhang tightâ as our companies were about to bring in serious capital. I told him I was on my way to a pawn shop to obtain a loan for groceries, he apologized for putting me in this financial situation and calmly said âhang tight.â 

As I type this on a library computer, I have a negative balance of ($85) in my bank account and $2700 maxed out on credit cards. I also owe ~$300 to friends and roommates. I donât have any family besides a little brother in college and I would rather become homeless than ask him financial assistance. John said I should have my payment by this weekend even though my second check is due November 1st. As of this morning I have removed him from our Google Drive folder although Iâm sure he would have made a copy of it by now. 

Iâm worried that I am being scammed and could desperately use your advice. Please help.

I accepted a position from my internship last summer partially out of panic. I had rarely been successful in finding internships and was lucky to have two non-prestigious internships at this point (both came in around April before summer, most students secure a spot by the previous November).

The deadline was about three weeks after my year began so I accepted the offer and took the signing bonus. But, I didn't feel happy with the company last summer, so my acceptance was for security. I made a decision to go and try to find a spot doing what I am passionate about with a more interesting company that will value me more.

Lo and behold, another company took me all the way through the interview process and gave me an offer. I think the second company is amazing, smart and has a great sense of teamwork and valuing the employees - that is what I got from the very personal interviews I went through. Additionally this company does work I am far more passionate about, and pays twice as much (literally). So I accepted the offer and emailed the other company saying I will not be returning to them and apologized.

The other company emails me back and says we are sorry to hear this, and asks why I am reneging. Should I tell them the truth, that I looked for offers after I accepted them and used them as a safety? Should I tell them that this new company offers far more to my career? Should I tell them I ultimately felt low balled and unhappy working with them? Should I not respond? Or should I lie and say personal reasons?

I want to limit damage here, but I would never even consider going back to the first company in the future, I just don't want news to spread or for me to be harassed, or for my new employer to find out and rescind my offer.

Let me just stress that I know the ethical implications here, and I already have a knot in my stomach. I feel like I am letting someone down, but from what people tell me that is what you have to do sometimes.

TL;DR I reneged an offer for an offer a thousand times better, old employer wants to know why I did. What should I say?"

So after applying to dozens of internships last summer, I landed one interview and it was for a company that pretty much solicited people on the street to buy their products.
Granted I'm going to be graduating with a BS in Marketing (this December), but this was not the ideal sales position for me.
Regardless, I was rejected by pretty much every other company. Now since I did not get any internship experience, the only experience I have is 3.5 years at a local jewelry store (still currently working here at an hourly wage). It's a proprietary business so it's not like I have the experience of working at a recognizable company.
I get so discouraged, feeling like my experience is so inadequate.

I've googled and reddit-searched a bunch of tips for resumes and cover letters, but I just want some personalized advice.
So what I'm asking is how can I improve my lack-of-experience resume? What words should I use to catch someone's attention? What kind of formatting would be best? Should I include a picture? I want to make it memorable and eye-catching.
As a future marketer I should know how to sell myself, but it's hard to show my personality through a piece of paper.

To add more about my credentials:
Working at this jewelry store allowed me to communicate with SO many different kinds of people and I like to think I'm pretty good at it. I've built a good rapport with a lot of customers.
I have the basic computer skills in Microsoft Office and fundamental Photoshop skills.
Social media knowledge (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
I have a 3.8 GPA and have done many projects regarding analyzing different businesses (including group projects).

How do I make an impression, Reddit!?

I work IT at a law firm and one of the Paralegals has been incessantly complaining about her computer being ""too slow"" or broken and has been slacking on her work.  We've cleaned the computer and done most everything possible. 
We need a new computer for an intern anyways so I got the okay from our Admin to just build her a computer that will give her no excuses (on our end) and this is what I've come up with. 

The only think I'd be worried about would be that she dual monitors and needs at least 8gb of RAM for multitasking, otherwise not terribly worried about anything else. This is my first build for the office.

He lives in western country, he have start up company, he first used to outsource the jobs in freelancing websites but the project got big (ERP system) that he wants a dedicated programmer for to restructure, optimize and add features to the ERP.

I told him, I have internship and I can't work full time, he told me  may be during the training month you can work less hours and once you finish your internship you will be working with us as full time. 

My problem is:

-I never worked professionally before as programmer.
-I'm not confident enough in my skills as Programmer to take job working in  big ERP system in programming language I don't know about.
-I don't know if I would have enough time to do both jobs.

Trying to make some tough decisions and would appreciate guidance if you have any: I have offers from MongoDB or LinkedIn to work in their NYC offices as an intern for my Junior-Senior year summer.  Here's some information about each:

MongoDB:

* Working in Times Square
* Free Housing in NYU Dorm
* Good pay
* 30-40 Interns, 150 engineers
* Working on lower level software, Server or Cloud team

LinkedIn:

* Working in Empire State Building
* Free Housing in one Apartment nearby, shared with all interns
* Better pay (+$10/h)
* 5 Interns, 60 engineers
* Working on Consumer team, more user-facing product


Both offers are good, and offer housing in addition to competitive pay.  Last year, I worked on user facing features for a web company - so I feel like tech wise LinkedIn will be a fairly similar experience.  And having an intern class of just 5 people could go either way.  MongoDB seems to have slightly more interesting tech and a bigger intern class, but they pay less and I'm not sure how much faith I have in their product.

While tech is important to me, I want to make sure that I enjoy the summer even more and that means having a good group of co-workers to hang out with, do events, go to bars, etc.

Could anyone help provide me insight?  I know I'm trying to make a decision on multiple different fronts but I'm kind of stuck."

First month or two were okay but now I'm working between 9 and 12 hours every day nonstop, doing stupid support tasks my boss asks me to do. For example today I had to apply a math formula, and the result was 5000% away from what my boss wanted. Boss insisted I did it again until it worked. Excel didn't change its mind. It hasn't been the first time this happened. I was there until 20:45 and I said fuck it, my coworkers stayed for even longer. I think they do over 13 hours everyday.

In theory, every lawyer works this much, and in the future I'll get to earn proper money (although in my country lawyers earn WAY less than in the USA) instead of below a living wage like now. However right I'd rather have a law office with a friend, but we'd probably end deep in debth, and I still have a lot to learn before doing that. And one way or another, I think I am learning here, even if it's ""what not to do"" or ""what not to waste time on"".

I also feel like I hurried a lot, I'm 22, but my family is rather poor and they can't afford me being the enternal college student. I have classmates who didn't start looking for a work until they were 28 and they mock me for studying instead of partying with them but I can't afford a single drink at the places they go to.

I'll give you guys as much background as possible. I went to a for profit college that no longer exists...Graduated with no issues, landed a job at the college that lasted until graduation. Landed an internship that I turned into a full time position at a small (~200 users) company. Been with the company for 2 years now. Started as a Desktop Support Technician...I am now an Information Systems Support Specialist. I have no idea if that title translates to anything else though.

My daily duties are basically running the helpdesk (first point of contact on all tickets; usually about 70% of all tickets are resolved by me.) I'm also in charge of AD duties that include user creation/deletion (correct OU, a mailbox etc.) Lately, I've also been able to do some VERY light config edits on our firewall.

I'm not seeing where I should be going from here. Do I make a lateral transition to a larger company (I'm close enough to Silicon Valley) or should I shoot for a junior sys admin role? So lost. I think I've hit my peak at the company (both in learning, position and compensation, which is already pretty low IMO.)

And well, I want to know if I'm applying to the right places or if I'm being unrealistic. 

So far it's been mostly larger banks and Fortune 500's with formal internship programs.  I've sent out a little over 80 applications so far.  This is for the summer before my senior year.

I'm a junior at SUNY Cortland, a state school that has only been ranked consistently for being a ""great value"".  I'm sitting on a 3.93 overall, 3.98 in major and I'm putting in overtime to get both of these as close to perfect as I can, not for career purposes but personal satisfaction. (4.0'ed a 21-crediter last semester boo-yah!).  Major: Business Economics concentration financial management, minor in computer science.  

Prior sophomore internship with Fortune 50 company.
EC's -RA, TA, Greek founding father(now VP), study abroad in Accra, Ghana, convener for non-profit awarding 10K to local charities, speaker at diversity conference, eco and tennis club.  LinkedIn game on point, super social on campus, great relations with professors (bought beer for the guy I'm a TA for last week).  Frankly, I love college and don't want to move on but eh its almost time and I want to transition into a just as kick-ass career as my college experience has been.

So back to the question at hand, 
*Should I be bothering with applying to bb's and the f500?  I'm guessing just my school starting with SUNY will get me tossed most of the time which I don't mind, I just don't want to waste my time.
*Is there a better fit in the industry for me to target?  Prestige isn't important, I just want a career where I can put my work ethic to use and bang out fairly-comped 70 hour work weeks.  

Also, can we share linkedin's here?  Seems like it would be advantageous given the demographic and I have no worries with putting it out there."

I am a junior CS student, applying for internships now. My resume is actually very good, as I like to build things (apps, websites, entrepreneurial things) and work very hard at these projects as they are exciting to me. I was able to secure an internship at a very well known bank in their technology program last summer. With these two aspects of my resume, I have been able to get interviews with nearly every company I am interested in. Seriously, I went to the career fair and only targeted big companies, and 4 out of the 5 companies wanted to interview me, and I haven't heard from the last one yet. I am not trying to brag, just explaining my situation.

I haven't been the best CS student. My GPA is sub 3.0 and I struggle a lot in my CS courses, especially math heavy ones like Discrete Math and Algorithms. I tend to do okay in most coding courses, although the exams screw me up because I have a difficult time memorizing specific material. I am just not the best student.

So naturally, now that I'm interviewing at tech companies, I'm awful at interviews. My first technical interview was with Fog Creek last year, and I bombed that. I had Facebook a few weeks ago, and I bombed that. I think I just bombed another with a very well known tech company in the valley. I have a Google interview coming up soon.

I just can't think up stuff on the spot. In most recent interview, I couldn't come up with iterative DFS. Although I understood that the answer required iterative DFS based on the requirements, I just coudn't figure it out. I spent half an hour tracing out my shitty solution, effectively demonstrating that I don't even understand how iterative DFS works. I understood DFS when I learned it, but have since forgotten. 

I think I end up demonstrating that I'm a ""copy-paste from StackOverflow and hack something together"" kind of programmer, but I know I would be a more valuable employee than that. I have better and more creative ideas than any of my peers, and work extremely hard when I'm interested in something. I may not be able to make myself excited enough about data structures to memorize every detail, but there's a reason I have a ton of impressive side projects on my resume. I know that if I were able to replace those side projects with any of the exciting projects at Google or Facebook, I would be a great employee.

* Solid UC Prompt 1 essay about coming from an ever-changing world and hence not having plans for the future and just being adaptable

* Feel confident in my supplements, especially the ""Why NYU/Columbia"" and Harvard's topic of your choice

**Rec Letters:**

Obviously I haven't actually seen them so I'm just going off of my feeling and what my counselor has told me:

* Supposedly amazing rec letter from CompSci teacher
* Meh letter from Physics teacher (counselor had an e-mail from him open and it didn't look too promising)
* Probably solid letters from Economics teacher as well as prior head of secondary education (my school is K-12) (haven't gotten any of these yet)
* Counselor report should turn out really well

**Schools:**

* Columbia (reach)/Harvard (yolo)

* UC Berkeley (reach)/UCLA (match)/UCSD (safety)

* Northwestern (high-match?)

* NYU Stern BPE Program (high-match?, demonstrated interest by visiting)

* Boston University (safety)

One final question - there's numerous people from my high school applying to the same colleges, and while they have better GPAs (4.0s mostly), I have the better standardized test scores and demographics going for me. I'd rate our ECs about equal, maybe mine slightly worse. How does that affect my chances? I guess my question is: **Do colleges mind accepting numerous kids from the same school?**

Thanks and good luck to all of you!"

Like the title implies, I am interested in both PhD Biomedical and Behavioral Neuro. I will have a BS in Psychology in may with a GPA of 3.724 in may. I also took a few classes each in biology and chemistry. My GRE scores were alright for a lot of the programs I am looking at, 155V 158Q and 4A. 

I have some research experience. Currently I have one psychology independent study that I am hoping to present next April, and I am assisting in some biopsy research. I will also have a research internship start next semester with another independent study in biopsy. All have a quantitative approach. For the assistant study, I designed an excel file that used logic and math to decipher EKG data and perform calculations. This is probably the biggest thing that I can think of that schools might like, but I am not sure. 

Based on this, can anyone offer advice as to how I may look as an applicant to these two programs, and what I could do to make myself more attractive? I am thinking about applying to a few top 50, one or two top 20, and some state school programs. 

Thanks in advance everyone. "

The thing is so far I've really been digging my classes. I really liked Physics Mechanics, TAM (Solid Mechanics, Dynamics, Statics) Thermo was pretty cool and now that we're doing modelling shit with rotating stuff, springs, and dampeners in my TAM-physics-on steroids class I'm enjoying it. I also enjoy computer science, and I'm going to get a minor in it. I feel like in general I like puzzles and learning and figuring things out in my head then just destroying an exam or something - if you tell me to change the brake pads on my car then I'd rather take a nap, create a rube goldberg machine or something and tell me to figure it out and I'd happily zone out and spend all night deriving every single element of it

Meanwhile people tell me it's important to 'act excited' at career fairs and there's no chance in hell I could pull that off talking about tractors or washing machines. This applies to a majority of stuff out there and I feel like that's why I've been so lazy with applying to internships (as a Junior).

But I did sign up for a tour at Wolfram Alpha soon and I'm looking forward to it, I think I'm starting to realize that I like learning theoretical things much more than I do following a rigid process on ""designing"" something or just using past experience to know how to machine or repair something.

Thoughts? I'm not sure if my perception of what kind of work I can do once out of college is skewed, maybe I'll just go to graduate school or get a programming job out of college, but I feel like that could get boring fast if its just repetitive shit.. Anyone else have this confusion on what they want to do, such as liking school but seeing yourself in the work force as shitty?"

I applied to internships in different cities, but so far I'm getting a lot more interviews from the companies in my city, Montreal. 

It seems like when I go to apply to some more internships for the winter, I end up just seeing the same companies I already applied to. I had one interview with a telecommunication company which I think went well but I would prefer having more interviews in case that one does not work out. 

I'm going to go to start up open house soon so I will be networking a lot soon, but I feel like start ups would be less willing to take a risk on someone with no professional experience. And frankly I would prefer my first internship would be with a company which had taken interns before so they actually know how to use interns. 

I tend to get a high amount of responses from the jobs I apply to from my universities career page, because it seems like I am the type of person they are expecting when they post there. (I don't understand why I get such low responses from the intern positions from indeed, who do they expect to apply? Obviously it would be people from montreal universities)

Honestly I want to work for that telecommunication company, but I want to increase my chances so I don't get nothing.

I'm a first year grad school student in Medical Physics. I have been doing fine so far in other courses, but this specific course has been giving me hard times. 

The material that is being covered in this particular class is basically electrical engineering that I have very little knowledge about, since I have never taken an EE course. Naturally I had no idea how the exam questions would look like, and how to be prepared for this specific exam.


The test turned out to be basically based on memorizing equations and proofs. I failed. 

However, many other students seem like they did well, I'm perplexed. 

The professor probably will realize that I have failed to actually understand the course materials (I still struggle to find a reasonable relevance between the material and the major). Nonetheless, I am going to meet the professor regarding my poor performance on this exam and try to find a way to pass the course. 

Anyway, here is my question: The lecturer of this course is the department head. I fear that looking like an idiot in front of him like this might cost me an internship or research opportunity in the future. Should I worry about this? 


Thanks in advance.

Since I was a little kid I was very interested in learning to program, specifically game and application development.  For various reasons though, I had a bunch of false starts and just never was able to get over the hump.  Back then learning resources were scarce (nothing like all the websites today that teach code for free) and forums were filled with jaded software engineers bitching about the field.  Going through high school, I was dead set on going to a computer science college with a concentration in game development, but my family eventually discouraged me against it since it was VERY expensive (25k a year - 4 years), the school was entirely across the country, and they really wanted me to get into a medical or business field.  Looking back though, I feel that not attending is one of my biggest regrets.  Anyway, since then I went to a local college, bounced around a bunch of majors and hated them all.  I dropped out and decided to pursue one of those audio production technical schools hoping to get into movie or video game audio and it was great.  I loved the school and actually got into game audio as an intern at an AAA game developer and eventually moved up to a Project Lead.  I did sound design for 4.5 years but it was constant up and downs, long breaks of unemployment, and lots of relocation.  I went back to college and gained a B.S. in Accounting thinking it would be a stable field, but even with 8 months of internship experience I'm struggling to find even a clerk level job that only pays 35k or less, and I'm hating the work/environment based on my work experiences in it.   

I'm 28 now, have bounced around multiple careers without any long term success (also did admin assistant, project management for a web dev firm, landscaping, labor, clerical, etc)  I'm getting older and dreams of having children and buying a home keep getting pushed back further and further since I can't seem to find a solid career path.  Long story short, for the past several years I've REALLY wanted to pursue software development as a career, but have been stopped by concern of the time and money I would need to go back to school this late, and two, a fear that I might not be able to actually do it.   However, the older and older I get, I feel my fears are irrational and if I really want this, which I do, I should just do it no matter what the time or expense instead of just doing things I hate or struggling to get by.  I've explored and researched so many career options and ultimately made the bad choice to pursue those that were easiest for me to learn and pickup without much time or expense, and not particularly the ones I really wanted to do like software development.  

So I'm at the point where I feel pretty serious about pursuing software development as a career, probably freelancing with audio or working low paying clerk positions while I make the journey, but considering my age and my desire for this undertaking to make a low financial footprint, I'm looking for advice on the most efficient path for myself to become a full fledged software engineer with no previous background.  More specifically, should I go back to college again and pursue a degree, or would I be better off with self teaching?  I definitely think that college would be useful for the resources, networking, and possible job fairs or other foot in the door opportunities, but I would need another 2-3 years (I need to take some science and calculus courses yet, but rest of gen eds I can transfer) and the cost is high.  Really, I just need the most efficient path for my ultimate goal of finding steady work in software engineering, and I have no issues starting at the bottom of the ladder, but I don't want to get to the end of my journey and be struggling to find work AGAIN!  Any resources, materials, courses, programs, tips, etc are all appreciated.   Sorry for the long post, and thank you!"

I'm terrible at interviewing and got lucky last summer due to variance and got the big 4 internship. I thought with the big 4 internship, I could depend on volume this year for new grad positions. 


This year I've been SOL. I've failed interviews at all big 4. I've applied to all top tier software companies that weren't big 4.

Believe me, I did my research. This isn't even about the ""big 4"". I applied to 20-25 other obvious but not mentioned top companies like Palantir, Uber, etc. And obscure ""top"" startups that no one EVER talks about like Mulesoft. My ""big 4"" is actually a big 50. I've literally gotten only 2 responses other than the big 4 (who give interviews to everyone) and I failed both the Hackerrank test they gave me. 


I've sent out 200 applications with a 10% response rate. Out of the few that responded, only a small fraction of them will pay more than what I made during my internship COL adjusted. 

It turns out that most of the top 50 except for the big 4 hire from referrals and on campus interviews at top schools. I can't get referrals because I'm at a mediocre school. I tried sneaking into a top school's career fair for on campus interviews with little success. 

I most likely will get a decent paying job given enough volume. I just feel like a failure knowing that I'm taking a full step back from just a few months ago. Unhappiness comes from stagnation and/or moving backwards no matter where you are in life.

Last year, I had to choose between an interesting internship at an unknown company or the big 4 doing boring business logic/CRUD work. I wasted my summer at the Big 4 since the Big 4 name didn't help me get interviews at any of the companies I really wanted to work for.  

I also chose my university over UIUC. Sigh....

Did anyone else fail? Did you end up bouncing back after 1-2 years?"

So far, I like my major and I have a great internship lined up for the summer, I'm just not so sure I am cut out to be a good developer. Math classes kick my butt, and freshman year I did fine in all of my computer science courses-- 1 A and 1 B. But, this year is a different story. My computer science classes make me feel stupid about something I am supposed to be good at. This semester started out fine, but now I just stare at some of the homeworks we have to do and don't have the slightest clue how to solve them. I understand whats going on for the most part, I just do not know how to transfer that into code. That makes me think I'm just not really cut out for this field. Basically, I just want to know your opinions from people who have gone through the same stuff as me, and what helped you. Whether you guys think its just not for me? Or if I should just push through it? Do you have any advice about becoming a better programmer? Stuff like that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit:A lot of it I guess just not knowing where to get started. In this current homework, we are using recursion to solve a maze. I built the maze just fine, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do the harder part which is the recursive algorithm. I can do all the easy stuff , just can never figure out the harder stuff. I feel like I should know much more than I already do"
3qqofl,0,2015-10-29,"Should I study Databases, Operating Systems, Networks, Computer Architecture for interviews for entry-level-type positions at top companies (like Big 4)?",interviewcs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qqofl/should_i_study_databases_operating_systems/,"I have interviews coming up with three of the Big 4 companies and several other tough-interview, tech companies (think Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn). I have been in the industry for about 1.5 years at a small, unknown startup and I've never interviewed with big companies that give tough whiteboarding questions before. I have been preparing for them by: brushing up on data structures, algorithms, system design, and questions from sites like leetcode.    

Besides the usual topics I've listed, should I also be studying and reviewing:

* database topics (like SQL queries, database optimization)
* operating systems (threads, deadlocks, mutex--I assume for Google I need to know this topic because they listed it on the prep sheet)
* networks (difference between get vs post, explain tcp)
* computer architecture (what are examples of questions they could ask for this topic?)
* is there anything else I'm missing?


I am interviewing for the most generic, backend positions on the career pages of the companies. I am fairly sure I will be considered entry-level, or junior level since I have very little work experience (1.5 years full time &amp; no internships). So I'm not sure if I should be worried about getting *all* the CS fundamentals down or not. Or do these additional topics matter only if I'm applying to positions like database engineer, production engineer, devops? Should I even study the basics of the topics above? I'm asking this last question because time is of the essence.


**tldr:** I've spent 1.5 years in the industry and am interviewing for generic backend positions at the Big 4 (and the like). I am studying data structures, algorithms, and system design. Should I also be worried they'll give me interview questions on databases, operating systems, networks, computer architecture, or other CS topics? Or am I over thinking this?"

&gt;It may also help to review core Computer Science concepts (algorithms, data structures, OOA/D, design patterns etc.) as well as **subjects pertaining to the large scale nature of our environment.**

Do they really ask questions related to 'large scale' or anything like that for internships? According to glassdoor they've asked ""How would you make facebook faster"" before but on careercup and glassdoor I haven't found anything else similar. Only coding questions.

I'm completely unprepared to answer questions like that. There is a chapter in CTCI on ""System Design and Scalability"" but I want to focus on data structures and algorithm questions if I can afford to."

3qs0x9,6,2015-10-29,Almost a year after undergrad and still no job.,EpicBoredom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qs0x9/almost_a_year_after_undergrad_and_still_no_job/,"It's been almost a year since I graduated from college and the job search has been atrocious for me. I have yet to find anything and I am slowly losing hope in my abilities as a computer scientist.

I graduated from a small liberal arts college (one of the top in the country) who is not known for having the best computer science department, and only has around 4 faculty members. That being said, I believed that we did great work for what we had and the project's that I worked on as a student are good enough to put on my resume. There was also this notion going around on how people prefer someone with a liberal arts degree and that it is valued more highly today.

Yet as I go on this job search of mine, it becomes more and more demoralizing on how little my experience in college seems to matter. All those late nights working on projects to meet the deadline, or even to try to improve my project just seem wasted now. I graduated with a relatively high GPA, but nobody seems to care. I can understand this because everyone just wants someone who is experienced and can actually do the work, but because I don't have experience and did not get an internship, It seems like  I am doomed to fail or have a really tough time getting a job.

The number one thing people say to do is start a project, but for me that is very difficult. I do not want to do something small because it feels like its a waste of time since I have great projects I can already talk about from college. If I do something big, it needs to be innovative and fun for me as well and I don't feel like I have the motivation to do something like that. It also feels like the projects are only the first step in getting the door open in terms of getting that first call, and that is not really my issue now. I do get calls back, but the biggest problem I have is that I am not a fast coder (or maybe its hard for me to code when I have people analyzing my every move). When someone tells me to find the solution to a problem, I tend to sit on it and think and then start to code. Even then the coding part is slow for me, but the reason I did well in college was because I would spend hours doing it and it would be really fun to me. The interview process does not fit the type of person I am in the slightest and its gotten to the point where I do not know what I should do after almost a year of getting rejected.

So I turn to cscareerquestions for any advice at all on how to get back on track and hopefully land my first job. Almost everyone I know from my college got their first job through an internship, and they have expressed how easy it was to get an internship and have it lead to a job compared to the process I am going through now. If I could I would have gotten an internship but that is behind me now. They have consoled me as well saying that I would be fine once I get the job, the problem is getting it. So any words of wisdom would be great. sorry for the long post, I just am really feeling out of place and wondering if my cs degree was a waste of time.

TL;DR - I didn't get an internship my junior summer and am now feeling lost and demoralized after being rejected for almost a year on junior dev positions, despite working my ass off in college. Any advice, harsh truths, and or criticisms are welcome."
3qsil1,1,2015-10-29,I don't really want to be purely a software developer -- my experience is military and overseas contracting,Innouthule,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qsil1/i_dont_really_want_to_be_purely_a_software/,"Despite lurking for months, I'm still not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit for me and my conundrum. 

It seems most people here are looking for developer positions. A startup gig in Silicon Valley or a spot at one of the Big 4 is perfect for them.

Unfortunately that's not me at all. The idea of coding day in and day out sounds really tedious. 

I started in combat arms in the military but I've always had an aptitude for computers and technology. My command team recognized that quickly and I did a lot of the more tech-centric jobs that were above my pay grade. By the time I was getting out, I had realized that computers were my calling so I decided to get a Computer Science degree. Before I could even start school, however, I got an opportunity to start contracting in support of the military operations overseas using the same technology skills my command staff used me for. Once again, I was very good at my job. I liked going to remote, hostile areas and getting the job done. The pay was very nice, too.

Now I'm finishing school and it's further convinced me that a purely developer role is going to bore me. I got an internship with a consulting company, which is nice because there is a lot of variety in the types of projects that they do. They've intimated that they are going to be giving me an official full-time position offer soon. Unfortunately, the role is going to be primarily software development as well as sales and consults. I've also looked around at some other companies, gone to career fairs, etc. And the more I see the more I realize that these are almost exclusively entry level positions for software developers, with nothing more...exciting. On top of that, the pay scales are exclusively on the end of entry-level.

Here's my conundrum: Do I bite the bullet, accept that a CS degree = software developer career track and resign myself to the fact that I'm essentially starting from scratch like my classmates? Or do I continue to look for the more exciting jobs that will utilize my abilities and willingness to go places and do things a comfy developer type would never dream of doing? 

The way I see it, if I choose the former option, then a lot of my skills are not going to transfer and I'm going to be taking a pretty huge pay cut. 

Choosing the latter option in some ways is harder. The jobs are fewer, and almost all of the jobs require very specialized training and experience. There are some more general career paths that are government; I was thinking the FBI might be a good fit for me.

I also understand that if I do decide to be a software developer, at least for a while, I can always change and do something more exciting later. I just feel that taking an entry-level salary is going to hurt me in the long run.

This subreddit seems to have some really good advice overall, so I'm hoping some of you have insight for my situation."

Degree is 3 years long, relatively short (I was thinking of spanning it to 4 years anyway).

GPA is horrible, less than 2/4. 

Understand that it was entirely my own fault, would love to redo first year with updated time management skills, less procrastinating and more involvement in outside projects/extra curricular. 

However, I can do the second versions of the cores (1a I'm doing now and 2a I'll be doing) during summer. So by semester 1 next year I'll be on same pace as everyone else. 

However I'm leaning towards starting anew, learning from my mistakes and trying harder will end up with a good gpa enough for internships at high companies (something which I'd never be able to do with my current gpa).

Also, I don't trust myself to have to be stable enough to go through summer courses, so perhaps during the summer I'll look for work or learn myself.

Yes, I know I screwed up so badly, and I've learnt so much this year. Made some decent progress with my counsellor too.

I really don't mind being a year behind everyone else, I came to this degree with the intent of building solid programming/problem solving skills so I can create my own projects. 

Please help!

My thing is that I'm looking hard for something over the spring semester and co-ops seem to be drying up.

I'm looking for more west coast stuff btw if you want to shoot me a PM of a place to start. Thanks peeps!

EDIT: Btw, if you're a sophomore/freshman in engineering, hit the books like crazy. The only reason I got these interviews was because of constantly hitting up career fairs and seeing people in person and all the projects I've done while at my internship and my leadership position in IEEE. Every single one of those positions told me a my GPA is way too low despite it being above their cut off. I underestimated how much GPA truly matters. It gets my foot in the door, but HR really doesn't like the low GPA. Regardless, I still am pretty hopeful in finding an internship and will try to pick up my GPA as high as possible by my senior year.

So Bloomberg is one company that I am willing to die for! They have projects on Machine learning, they have few projects in C/C++ and they work in the financial domain! So its like my dream company!

I attended an interview with them for internship when they came to my college. I had 2.5 tech rounds with them and 0.5 behavioral round. The last round was with their R&amp;D head and a HR person. There were tech questions as well as behavioral in the last round. After like a week, I was contacted by the behavioral round HR person and I was told that I am rejected and she highly recommends that I reapply in spring. 

I have a few questions now.

(1) Their website started listing summer software intern role for 2016 again. Should I apply there or wait for them to come to my campus again for recruiting.

(2) If I do get the same people who interviewed me earlier will they be skeptical in passing me to the next round considering I was ultimately not selected for the job earlier?

(3) If the answer to the above question is yes, would I be interviewed by different people if I apply through their website?

(4) I have the HR lady's email address I guess. If they don't call me for an interview during the campus career fair or if I want to attend an interview before that, would it be considered okay to email the HR lady and request her to get me an interview? I am pretty sure she doesn't remember me, but still can I email her ever to request an interview?

Doing a laptop hinge/LCD replacement for a client, and also a funny story about this specific case.",Jdibs77,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3qvdus/need_advice_on_hardware_doing_a_laptop_hingelcd/,"I worked for a short time as an intern at a PC repair place. Even though I was only a lowly intern, I did do a lot of actual work, so I'm pretty decent at this stuff. However, I never got much experience working on screens or hinges because we had a ""hardware guy"" that would always take them. Now I'm doing freelance tech support to pay my grocery bills at college.

Anyways, I'm gonna start off with the amusing part of the story, and get to the whole asking for help thing later. If you want, skip to the last three paragraphs. So I met with this girl to give her a quote for a broken LCD. I gave her my price, and she went ahead and ordered it. When it came time to install it, I was walking her through what I was going to do, and said ""First I'm gonna take out the battery, It's always good to do that so you don't get shocked, fry a component, or whatever"". And then I realized that it was gonna be a slight pain in the ass to get the battery out, because it was inside the bottom bezel. So I thought ""*Fuck it, it's just an lcd replacement, I'm not going to fry something*"". So when I skipped the battery, she was obviously concerned. I reassured her that it *is* good practice to remove the battery, but we'd be fine because you don't mess with many electronic parts other than the screen connector.

I get the screen in, put it all back together, and *then* test it. Stupid move, I was overly confident. Aaaaaand the screen doesn't work. She gets slightly upset, but again I reassure her and say it's most likely the connection plugged in wrong. I take the laptop apart, redo the connection, and test it. Now it turns on, but it's only white. TWICE I had gotten it all set up, got her all excited, and completely let her down. She was clearly thinking it was all my fault because I didn't take the battery out. I'm kinda panicking at this point, because this chick is giving me the most horrible look and I think I broke her laptop. So I plug the old screen in, and it works fine. ""*Phew, I can just blame the LCD. It was DOA*"". Now as I'm explaining to her that getting a bad part is rare, how to return it, etc., I plug the new lcd back in just for the hell of it. What do you know. It works. Perfectly fine. Now, I had double checked the connection every time, especially after it gave no output. Every single time, it looked perfectly identical to how it looked when it worked. I just sat there, staring at the Windows sign in screen thinking ""*What did I do to make this thing work???*"". I was almost convinced this poor girl would have to deal with RMA'ing an lcd that I fried on accident. So in order to retain any semblance of credibility, I told her ""There we go! It just needed some calibrating, new screens sometimes need some adjustments to display properly"". Which is true...I guess...sometimes you just need to calibrate and adjust the connector? This story is a perfect example of why I hate working in front of people. Shit just stresses you out when you don't get it right on the first try.

Now on to the real issue here. If me putting a story in there violated any rules, please let me know and I'll repost it. I didn't see a rule against it. So, this is an **Asus X555LA** laptop. I did get the LCD taken care of, nothing's wrong there. But when I was putting it back together, we noticed that the hinge cover was crooked. In reality, it wasn't even snapped in, it just looked like it. You could clearly see some wiring on the right side when looking underneath the lcd. Me and this girl both had to get to class, and didn't have time to mess around with it. So we agreed on me getting 1/3 the quoted price at the time, and the rest when I fix it later today. So I don't have the laptop to take pictures of it.

I tried just snapping it back on, but I couldn't seem to get it. So I tried slipping a credit card in between the base (of the whole laptop) and the lid, and using that for extra leverage to push it towards the lid (where it snaps on). Not working. We tried both pushing it in from separate sides, nothing. I can get it lined up at the right orientation while I'm positioning it, but when I push it in, it moves off to the side. It seems like most Asus's have two hinge covers, one for each hinge. This one has a very wide, single cover that stretches across both hinges and is shaped like a 'U'. I did some research, and there are like two articles I can find about this. Neither are very helpful, but one mentioned sliding it? However, there doesn't seem to be any real room to slide anything anywhere. Do any of you have experience with these weird Asus hinge covers? I know it's a rather obscure issue, but I'm sure SOMEONE has had something similar."

What are the best sources to read before going into the interview?"
3qvjs5,61,2015-10-30,"I work at a video game PR agency specializing in Indie games, AMA",thecollector24,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3qvjs5/i_work_at_a_video_game_pr_agency_specializing_in/,"Not here to promote the agency or our games, just here to help out as I know many of you may have questions about PR and Marketing. 

**-What PR Agencies do for you:** Basically we have an emailing list (about 10,000 emails) that's filtered to specific  genres so we know who to email regarding what games, a lot of people don't publish their emails online so its really hard to get them if you don't go to trade shows or anything. So we send out a pitch to these people which announces your game, along with assets and they choose to run it on their site,Chanel, or magazine. 

From their we get in contact with editors and tell them why they should review your game, and send them incentives or give them codes for giveaway. Editors want to have your game at least a month before it's release, if you are contacting them on release day, they most likely will turn you down.

We also get you better pricing on advertising, usually we buy advertising from large pages and they will promote your games heavily on your page. This is not recommended for smaller games though, as a campaign like this can cost somewhere between $50,000-$250,000

We also spend most of the time talking to editors and fielding questions about the game, most my time is occupied by this. We follow up regularly with editors to ensure that they cover the game , if you don't touch base with them at least once every other week they will forget about you.

Once your game is released we go into overdrive and follow up on everyone who hasn't posted a review of the game, and find more people to do lets plays,discussion, reviews and giveaways. We also start combining a coverage report for you so you can see who is covering your game and what their viewership is like.

**-What it cost:** For a small PR Agency of several people you are looking at about $5000 a month, seems like a lot but remember you're only going to be paying this cost for about a month before your release and a month after, so the $10,000 cost isnt so bad, especially if you're thinking of adding a PR Agent to your team ($50,000 salary). Larger PR firms will probably range from $8,000-$15,000 depending on how big they are and how much time they are focusing on you, elite agencies may charge you even more than that.

**-What you should know:** Your game will most likely be passed down to a person like me to handle, usually they guy talking to you on the phone and promising things isn't going to do much. I get paid a fraction of what my boss does, and basically do all the work, but he will tell you that he is personally looking over everything, so take what ever they guy says on the phone with a grain of salt, because he doesn't really know much. The amount of time dedicated to your game isn't much, as most agencies have a large number of clients, so even if they tell you that you're a priority, you really are not. Also, try to negotiate your price, if they tell you they want to do your PR for a month at $6,000, tell them that you can only do $4,000,  they will probably hit you back with $4,500 but that's still a better deal, most likely they are paying an intern to do your work, so they get profit either way.

**-Can I do my own PR?-** Yes you can, but just know you're going to burn your self out. A lot of my day is eaten up with just tracking people down to look at a game, and when a game just isnt that intersting, people will turn it down. If you are really strapped for cash though, you can hire a freelance PR person to take you on for a share in the company (I do this from time to time). If you really want to try and do it your self though, find a useful Email list (there is one posted on this subreddit somewhere, I forgot where it is though), and make a great pitch to send out. The problem with doing this is that you may mess up, and first impressions are everything, so if you send a bad pitch one time, don't expect editors to open up your email again. A major part of the success of your game falls on your PR and Marketing, so take your time and don't be afraid to email anybody and everybody that you think will feature your game.

**Ask me anymore questions on here or message me, I'm happy to help out!**

3qvy46,0,2015-10-30,The Carnival,lor7_92,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3qvy46/the_carnival/,"Carnival.   

It always starts at the carnival. That twinge of pain.  

Small memories stuck in the paint of these joyful little rides.   

No matter how stubbornly I try to lacquer my facsimiles of happiness onto the past, that day still sits on the surface.    

My town has had this carnival as long as I can remember.   

Bright colors, pops of laughter, and royalty-free music all fueled by high fructose corn syrup.   

The window pane between the carnival and I makes it seem illusory, a projection of reality, like itâs a distant memory Iâll just be able to forget.    

If I lose grip for even a secondâ¦   

The sounds come rushing in. The voices. The-   

âLori?â   

My grandmotherâs voice snaps me out of my daze.   

She touches my right arm where me and my prosthesis meet just below my elbow.   

âYou donât have to stay, go somewhere else until this thing is over.â She nods out the window.   

She adds, âI know this isnât easy for you.â   

Her voice alone is enough to calm me.   

Grandma. The only constant in my life. Half the time Iâm not sure how she managed to raise me into this freshly graduated 23 year old.   

I mustered a smile, âNoniâ¦ itâs alright. Iâll be okay. You need me here right now.â   

We had each other. Her cancer had taken its toll, but you wouldnât know it to look at her. Her only real fear seemed to be that I hadnât had enough to eat.   

But, she was getting weaker. She needed someone here. Instead of pursuing my internship, I decided to stay with her.    

Her concern for me was voiced in a quiet sigh, and she promptly closed the curtains in front of the window, trapping the light humming from our cellophane wrapped lamps.   

Ever since that day her face always looked hurt. Damaged. As if what happened were her fault.   

Well, I suppose it isâ¦ partly her fault.   

The pain clicks again.   

âGrandma, I think Iâm turning in for the night.â   

âYour bed is all ready, Lor.â She pecked me on the cheek and added one more hug.   

I unpacked my things and looked around at the photos in my old room. Noni had turned it into a veritable altar to me since I left for college. From kindergarten to graduation, every era of Lori was there.   

I settled on one in particular.   

I saw a young girl who must be me, so happy.   

My eyes take a primal focus on a pair of hands on my shoulders. They were disembodied by a tactical fold in the picture.   

The fear developed from a few blotches of pigment on a lone photograph.   

My throat caught and I decided to sit down for a moment.   

The illusory pain running through my missing arm was all too familiar. Another reminder of a brain that doesnât work quite right - a genetic gift from a fucked up family.   

The merry-go-round in the distance undulated a mocking tone.    

Suddenly, the mammalian brain kicked in.   

Remembering those hands. Those hands that were my motherâs.   

Those hands that took me and my baby sister behind the carnival lights.   

Only flashes remain now:   

Sharp.  

Screaming no- Shrieking.   

Pleas to god from all sides, all submitting their own interpretation of salvation.  

It was all over so fast.   

The carnival lights dancing on the pools of warm bodies.   

My heart sank careening over the first drop of the roller-coaster. My hands went numb as I shook uncontrollably.    

I was stuck in a cycle of hyperventilation.   

I quickly unzipped my medicine bag and hastily removed my bottle of Tranxene. I desperately worked a capsule between my quivering lips.   

Too afraid to open my eyes, I curled under the covers.   

I squeezed my eyes so tightly.   

Afraid Iâd see her silhouette in the closet or down the hall waiting to complete her mission.   

Afraid Iâd see what was left of my sister again.   

I waited for it to pass.   

Iâm still waiting for it to pass.

So I am in a bit of dilemma and wanted to get some advice on a recent thought that I have been having. I'm wanting to know if it is worth leaving a current job to dedicate more time to work on a better development portfolio.

The place that I am currently working at is alright, but lately I've been wanting to pursue opportunities that would be more in my interest. And I do not feel comfortable doing that because I don't feel that I am at a good enough skill level. (Hence wanting to dedicate more time)

Not to get to detailed about my work environment but the work is incredibly boring, tiresome, and mentally draining. It doesn't challenge me in any way and the people that I work with all seem to hate each other. I don't really ever feel good after coming home from work and my motivation just seems gone most days. The only problem (if I can even classify it as that), is that I am drawn to stay at my job because they pay well enough for me to cover my student loans + rent + food.

I have had decent leads on web development work in my area before. I have also been networking within the tech community and was offered a web development internship last year. (I turned it down because the current company I work at offered more money... and at the time I didn't have much of a choice.) If something was ever offered to me again, I would rather hit the ground running instead of struggling to get up to par when I start the new job. If that makes sense?

A few things that I am curious about:

1) Has anyone else been in this kind of situation, and how has it gone for you?

2) How much do employers care about gaps in work history, specifically in the technology industry?

I want to be doing something that I enjoy. I want to be able to give myself a chance at breaking into the industry. And I am confident that I will be able to do so, and I'm going to keep at it until it happens. Any suggestions/tips/advice is appreciated.

Thank you."
3qy3mw,36,2015-10-31,"I used to be an addict, but it's what I saw *after* I got clean that haunts me",CatherineConstance,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3qy3mw/i_used_to_be_an_addict_but_its_what_i_saw_after_i/,"Some people say drugs make you crazy, and maybe some of them do. Heroin or meth, PCP, any of that ""hard"" stuff as we called it, that shit might make you go insane. But really what I learned was that it isn't the drugs. It's everything else.

I'm 26 and I live in Manhattan, been here two years now. My name is Jessica, if that matters. I've been here since I was 24 which is when I left LA, and my old life, behind for good. It started out innocently enough, I moved to Anaheim after college (I grew up and went to school in Boulder) to work at Disneyland. That was awesome for awhile, but then I got offered a job at a major record company, as an intern, but still it offered me the opportunity to meet and work with a ton of stars, something I had always wanted to do. So I finally gave in and took the job. 

It was awesome the first two months, but then ""record season"" began and people, both famous and not, were swarming us. My boss turned into a different man; he lived off of black coffee, cigarettes, and cocaine. It was intimidating, to say the least. So one day he ripped the door open to my office and told me [insert famous rapper's name here] wasn't going to sign, no way. So he devised this great idea for me to seduce him, and not only that, to make him fall in love with me to convince him to take the deal.

I refused, obviously. So he turned to me, looked me in the eye and sat down at his desk. He pulled out a little bag of chunky white powder, it almost looked like a sugar cube that had been cut into smaller sugar cubes. I knew he did coke, but I had never actually seen it. I was 22, so I drank occasionally, but nothing more than that. Very calmly he pulled out his wallet and removed a business card from some rep that he didn't care about, shook about half of the baggie full of sugar-like stuff onto it, and started chopping at it with a razor.

""You're going to do this,"" he said calmly.

""You're bat shit crazy if you think I'm going to do something so demoralizing for this underpaid *internship*."" The venom in my voice surprised me. He didn't bat an eye.

""Uh. Huh."" He was concentrated on cutting the tiny clumps into tinier clumps and then finally into powder. Apparently satisfied, he picked up the card, folded it slightly, and carefully slide about half of the powder onto the webbed space between his thumb and pointer finger, brought it to his nose, and inhaled sharply.

""Your turn,"" he said, extending the card to me.

I recoiled, disgusted. ""I quit, you disgusting pig.""

He shrugged. ""Suit yourself. Good luck getting hired anywhere else.""

""I'd like to think they'll choose integrity over a strung out druggie like you,"" I spat back.

""Oh honey, you'll be blacklisted by the time security kicks your size 00 ass out of the building.""

My heart sank as I realized he was right. Keith knew everyone. I mean *everyone*. 'Okay...' I thought to myself. 'One hit of coke. I've never done drugs in my life, this once is not going to hurt me.'

""Fine,"" I said, taking the card from his still out-stretched hand.

I tried to mimic what he had done, but it was no use. The powder went everywhere, I doubt I got even a quarter of it into my nose. I gasped, the pain was unexpected and strange like burning and freezing all at once.

""Good girl."" Keith beamed at me. ""Now go get ____.""

I'll try to keep this short, as how I became an addict isn't really the important part of the story. Basically, I did what I was told. I made ___ rapper fall for me (as much as a rapper can fall, that is), got him to sign, and then broke his heart as soon as Keith found the next guy he wanted to sign that he needed me to manipulate. I used the coke to get through the act of doing it, making these guys like me or even love me when I knew I was going to have to cruelly end it a week or so later. I drank afterwords when the guilt consumed me. I started by going to bars and ordered Mai Tai's with a double shot of rum. Then I switched to Screwdrivers. Then gin and tonic. Then gin minus the tonic, until finally I was sitting at home with one of those giant bottles of Kirkland vodka drinking it straight from the bottle.

Then I got a great idea. I knew drinking and coke weren't the way to deal with one's problems, so I went to a therapist. Except I lied. I told her that I had anxiety and guilt I needed to work through but left out the ""I can't stop chugging vodka from the bottle and snorting chemicals up my nose"" part. She prescribed me anti-depressants, and Xanax for my ""panic attacks"". When I left the clinic, I almost felt guilty, but I knew that the Xanax plus the vodka would be the best medicine after a cocaine fueled day of manipulating people. So that's how it went: coke in the morning, go fuck someone over. Coke in the afternoon with some vodka to make it until I could get home and drink the rest of the vodka then pop two or three Xanax and pass out. 

And then it was my birthday, when things got even worse. My dealer, yeah, I had a dealer by this point, gave me a tiny box for my present. When I opened it it was full of white pills. They were divided into six categories. 

""I... What are these?"" I asked him.

He beamed with pride. ""Well, those little circular pink ones are Valium, I know you get stressed out and those always help me. The smaller white circles are Oxy, the oblong, flatish ones are hydrocodone, the oval shaped yellow ones are Percocet, the bigger white circles are Vicodin, the cream colored circles are Molly. Enjoy boo.""

I tried to act surprised, but honestly, I was excited. I spiraled after that, there wasn't much I didn't try. I stuck to mostly pills and coke and alcohol, but sometimes I smoked with them, and I dropped acid a couple times. It made the work so much easier. Honestly, it made everything easier. It was like I didn't care about anything, and not in the depressed way but in a good way. It was a good not caring. 

Until the day I woke up in the hospital. It was a Monday in January and I had no idea how I got there. I was laying in a hospital bed, hooked up to every tube imaginable and there were crowds of people around me.

""Ketones in her urine, kidney failure rapidly dropping, liver functions in the red."" It was a woman's voice. She was standing by a monitor on my left, staring at a machine that was all lines and numbers and symbols I didn't recognize. Two men and another woman surrounded my bed and were frantically typing into various devices. 

""Stomach lining nearly non-existent."" That was the first woman again. ""Nasal cavity and sinus passages severely damaged, get derm Denny in here stat he might be able to repair the subcutaneous tissues so her dermal layers can grow back in the nasal cavity."" 

It was too much information, and I faded back to black. I quit cold turkey when they let me out. I didn't get to the hospital until Monday, the last thing I remembered was arriving at a work ""function"" Thursday night. *Four days* of my life, just gone. Gone because I took so many pills, and inhaled so much coke and chugged so much Everclear that I lost four days of my life. They had to do a rape kit on me because at some point during those 96 hours I had been raped, no surprise there. Sure, I felt violated, how could I not? But honestly, *completely* honestly... I really didn't care. I had no recollection of it. I wasn't pregnant and I didn't catch anything. So who the fuck cares? I was done, no matter what, I was done. I left LA the next day, just packed up my shit, cleared out my bank account and drove until I reached Morgan Hill, a quite little town in northern California. I stayed there two years. I hallucinated, a lot. But I knew it was all of the drugs I had been taking for the past two years of my life just cycling their way out of me, so I ignored it. But then I moved to New York.

When I got here, I was determined to start over. So I got a decent job, and started seeing a therapist, for real this time. I told her up front that I don't want to be prescribed anything. I got clean, truly clean. Once in awhile I'll have a glass of wine with dinner. No more binge drinking, no more pills, and certainly no more powder. But lately, I've been seeing people. They aren't people I know, or even know of. They're just random people. Except they aren't really here. The other day I was walking down 54th in the middle of the day, and I saw a man standing in the doorway to some sketchy apartment building. He had a bag of it... Of the powder in his hands. Half of his face was in the bag, inhaling deeply. For some reason I felt compelled to stop him.

""Hey! Hey stop! It's not worth it!"" I ran up to him. He slowly raised his face out of the bag and grinned at me with rotting, black teeth. He extended the bag towards me, and I moved to slap his hand away, except my hand went right through his wrist. And not like a ghost, no, it just snapped clean off and fell to the ground. I shrieked in horror, but he seemed nonplussed, simply lifting the bag back to his face. I ran away down the other street, wondering if I was truly going crazy or beginning to hallucinate.

But it keeps happening and somehow... I don't know... It doesn't feel anything like a hallucination. I see people doing the things I used to do, or sometimes worse things. But when I touch them, they fall apart, like they're made of crumbling clay. This went on for a few weeks before I lost it. I had just ripped a man off of a woman he was trying to assault, but when I did so his hands detached from his arms, and due to his grip on her shoulders, her shoulders crumbled and fell to the ground as well. I raced to the liquor store and bought the largest bottle of vodka I could find. I sat on the curb in front of one of those weird ass milk bar places and unscrewed the lid. I brought the bottle to my lips, but then remembered how far I've come. How I'm *not* those crumbling shells of humans. And so I smashed the bottle into the curb. It shattered, sending huge shards of glass flying everywhere, with the liquor slipping down the gutter towards the steaming manhole. I put my head in my hands and began to cry. I was so confused. I had no idea what was happening.

I didn't hear the girl approach.

""Hey. Hey, are you okay?"" I glanced up at the girl. She looked exactly how I used to look. Drunk, way too skinny, strung out, dark circles under her eyes. I just stared at her.

""Hey..."" She said again, placing her hand on my shoulder. Suddenly she jumped back.

""I... What the fuck?!"" I just stared up at her. She quickly turned and bolted the other way. I was so confused. I glanced at the place where she had touched me, but nothing was out of the ordinary. But then I looked down and noticed the pile of crumbly, flesh colored dust. I cocked my head, puzzled. I didn't understand what had happened, but I was suddenly too tired to care. It wasn't until the next day (today) that I realized I might be one of them. Someone whose flesh crumbles at the touch of another. I don't know what's happening to me. But I'm tired, so tired. I'm going to sleep now, but please, if you have any suggestions, help me. I don't know what's going on. It's just people are falling apart in front of me, but other people don't see it. At least, not everyone sees it. I'll update this, maybe, if this feeling of exhaustion ever goes away. "

this is going to be a bit of a long story, bare with me if you can.


So, 5 years ago I did not know what to do with my life but I loved the internet and computers so I opted to pursue a CS career because it was something ""I felt I will love to get paid for"". Fast forward 2 years later and in my last semester I came to the shocking conclusion that I do not like working with TCP ports and cisco network routing. I graduated (barely) with an AAS degree in Computer Operations: Network Administration and Security options. Knowing that I do not want to exclusively work in a CS field, I entered a study abroad program and LOVE learning about different cultures and people. I then changed my career to the social sciences and started majoring in International Studies. I am now loving and learning about theories of international development, the effects of NGOs, anthropology and sociology. I am now in my last semester and have internship experience working in NGOs which I greatly enjoy. I still love computers and the internet, so I decided to write an undergrad thesis on the effects of the internet in developing countries. 

I do not want to ""lose"" my AAS degree and would love to make it a strong selling point to an organization however I just do not know where. I search for different organizations that involve the internet but found little to none at all. 

in my interviews, they are always intrigued with my IT knowledge however many internships rarely have any concrete connection with both CS and the social sciences.

So as my title states, what can I do? 
what would you suggest me to look for? 
BTW I am in the NYC area

I appreciate any and all recommendations and thank you for reading! let me know if you need more info :)

3qz7hr,2,2015-10-31,What to expect for technical internship interview?,squarecompass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3qz7hr/what_to_expect_for_technical_internship_interview/,"I applied to a few summer internships recently, and one of them has already scheduled a general/technical interview with me via the phone. I recently interviewed for a student IT job which went well because I knew what to expect because I worked in IT for 3 years...But I'm not sure what to expect for a software development internship interview.

I have a few projects on my resume, so I'm guessing I should be prepared to talk about them, as well as basic data structures (currently taking it, so at least it'll be fresh in my mind). Beyond that, how exactly should I prepare for a phone interview?"

I'm absolutely loving it, and seem to be at the top of our class, but its the only java class they offer. All the others are in C+ and due to work and financial restrictions I can't attend school next semester. I've started going online to learn web development with HTML,CSS,Javascript. I've been trying to supplement that with codecademy and looking for other online resources which I just haven't checked out yet.

By the end of this semester we will have gone over everything from if,for,methods,classes,arrays,inheritance,and gui applications. 

My ultimate goal is to land a position in programming asap. This has led me to set some goals for myself of creating my own website to use as a portfolio and build an android app.

My question is where does this put me in the grand scheme of things with landing a job in the programming world? I understand its impossible to be a master after 1 semester but I just don't know where I stand at that point and if I'm wasting time trying to apply for positions at that point. How much programming knowledge do I really need to start my career? If after this semester its not enough to land an internship what shouldI be looking to do next? A programming bootcamp? Just continue with online tutorials? 

Just curious for anyones thoughts. Thanks for your time."

I had a lot of undergraduate research experience, mostly stuff like population surveys and demographics studies of songbirds, both in the US and abroad. I touched on mark-recapture theory but never learned how to use the fancy software to do really in-depth analysis, like Program MARK. My GPA was 3.72. 

I was a very good student in college. Now, as I'm looking at graduate programs and trying to find a professor who has funding, I'm realizing that I don't actually know how to do anything. I thought I was well-educated and experienced for an undergrad, but I don't know the first thing about geographic information systems or computer programing. I took a genetics course as a sophomore and don't remember much from it, although I have very recently become pretty interested in that field. Basically, when I look at potential advisors' web pages and read about what kinds of students they want, I realize that I don't have any of the technical skills they're looking for. 

I'm starting to be concerned that I'm not competitive enough to get into a program I like, but at the same time, aren't all beginning grad students pretty short on technical skills? Am I right to be worried? I'm not sure how I can fill those gaps in my education without taking more undergrad classes, and since I've already had four years, I'm a little bit skeptical that I'll learn what I need to learn just by taking more classes. I think I need to job shadow or intern with someone who can teach me these specific skills, but again, since I don't have experience with them, I can't get those internships. 

It's a dilemma. Any input much appreciated."
3r0dgl,4,2015-10-31,"How do you know that you're ""good""?",cscqThrowAway1337,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3r0dgl/how_do_you_know_that_youre_good/,"This is going to be more focused on Junior Developers, maybe mid level as well since at these levels it may be harder to judge yourself do to lack of experience. 


I basically want to start a discussion where the topic is how do you know when a developer is good or I suppose, as a junior, that you're on the right track. There's always the statement that there's plenty of jobs but not enough qualified developers/good developers but no one ever really elaborates on that beyond saying something related to FizzBuzz. Is there really that many ""senior"" devs that barely know how to program? 


A bit of a personal background to shed some light on what caused me to write this up:


I'm a new grad that has been working as a web dev(java/spring + angular) for about ~3 months. Prior to this I had 2 internships during college but with very small companies. 1 was ~7 months long where I did some Java work and light JSP/HTML stuff for a medical billing application(The project consisted of me, another intern, and our manager). The other was ~5 months long where I did web consulting working at a start up(~20emps) with ruby/rails. At both of these internships I was always told I did well and learned quickly. At my current job, although I've only been here a short time I feel like get stuff done(I don't think i've missed any deadlines yet) but whenever I get a new assignment that has a larger scope than what I've previously worked on I usually spend time having to kind of reassure myself that it's not that bad and I can handle it. However, I recently had a code review with a more senior employee(my company doesn't formally do them, he just wanted to talk about a class I wrote) and he said I was doing very well but have a few things I need to work on. 


However, given all this reassurance I still feel like i'm only ""average"" for a junior developer. Even though, a few weeks after I was working at my current company, they hired a ""senior dev"" on a 3 month contract to help out on the project I was on. This guy is someone who definitely fits the stereotype of ""bad"" senior developer. He ended up asking me many questions on how to do basic tasks(maintenance/bug fixes)  and ultimately got fired after only 3 weeks.


TL;DR: 
I'm a junior dev who has always been told he's doing well and has seen people more senior than myself do very poorly(worse than myself). How do you know when you're ""okay"" or ""Above average"" for your level ?
