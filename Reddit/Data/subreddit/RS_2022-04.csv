I probably should have had done less generic CS ECs, spent better time on them, and probably have done better in freshman year (3 Bs, not bad, but ig bad for CS). I spent a lot of time on essays, but I guess I am just not a good writer. CS has gotten very competitive, but at least UMD is pretty good for (T20 iirc) and it instate. I think future seniors should develop good relationships with your teachers, and have good qaulity ECS."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Didn't read my LORs, but I can guess.

*Physics and Calculus Teacher (7/10) -* I have known him since my seventh grade and he has watched my growth in leadership and learning since then. The only downside is that he is a brutally honest person, which will raise his credibility, but also I don't know if he would say anything negative..

*AP Seminar Teacher and ASB Advisor* (8.5/10) - The teacher is an amazing writer and has had me as an active student for multiple classes, as well as has watched me lead as President for two years.

*Counselor (7/10)* \- She is new to the school, but has observed my leadership and participation in many clubs and around the campus. I also gave her a list of accomplishments and things about me to mention.

**Interviews**

*Harvard Interview* \- Went really well. The conversation lasted for about an hour and a half and we talked about life and philosophy for a lot of it.

*Georgetown Interview* \- Another interview that seemed to go pretty well. We had a lot of crossover in interests, so it wasn't hard to make it into a fun, engaging conversation.

*Stanford Interview* \- The interview was good. Another interviewer I had a lot in common with, but I think I did come across too eager and enthusiastic.

*Dartmouth Interview* \- It was a very young interviewer and he seemed to stick to the script much more. The interview was relatively short, around 40 minutes, but there did not seem to be any slip ups, and I believe that I answered the questions pretty well.

*Princeton Interview* \- I had a really old interviewer, and I think I sucked up to him a bit too much, but aside from that, the interview went for around an hour and he talked to me way too much about why the US should switch to the metric system.

**Essays**

*Personal Statement* was about the journey of ""me and my piano"", and the way I was able to connect it to science and learn from it. I honestly think it is the best piece of writing I have ever done, and it genuinely is in my voice, which is nice. Most people said it was really good, but how much can you trust your friends who are just trying to be supportive?

*Common App Supplements* were nothing special, but the Why Us essays were all copy pasted and then I put in details specific to the school's research programs and little details that aligned with my interests.

*PIQS*: I spent the most time on these, even asking a private counselor, my school counselor, and my AP Research teacher who is an amazing writer for advice, and made the proper revisions to better bring out my voice. One was a shortened version of my personal statement. Second spoke about me leading my Science Bowl team, learning from my mistakes, and how we became more of a family as time went on. Third is about my journey with antisemitism and how I created a supportive community in and out of my school to help combat it. Fourth spoke about my fascination with how the human body works like a machine and how through shadowing local dentists, I found my dream job - creating technology to make procedures safer and more efficient.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I don't think my ratings of letters I haven't read would be particularly accurate, however, one of my three recommenders sent me her letter and it was a 10/10 (made my mom cry). I am extremely close with my other two recommenders and can assume that their letters were also pretty good.

**Interviews**

I did quite a lot of interviews (7 total) and they were all generally good. I don't think anything particularly stood out about any of them. All of my interviewers were nice and seemed to like me. My Princeton interviewer in particular was very adamant that he'd be giving me a very strong recommendation.

**Essays**

Like letters of recommendation, I think it's so hard to judge the quality of my own essays. Frankly, I wouldn't have submitted anything I didn't think was a 10/10. I did drafts f my personal statement for like a year and a half before I landed on my final topic, and then I worked on that for a long time. I'd like to think it was good.

*Acceptances:*

* State School (EA) w/ Honors College and Multi-Year Study Abroad Program

tte9qz,17,2022-03-31,"'Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision'...and after 300+ applications, 10+ interviews, I finally see it come to light.",ConsciousOwl442,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tte9qz/didnt_have_a_dime_but_i_always_had_a_visionand/,"**Just wanted to create an uplifting post for those that are struggling with job-searching in these hectic times \[FYI it's kind of long, so scroll down for TL;DR\]:**

Some context: So I graduated in December 2020 with a Bachelor's in Finance (no internship exp. b/c the pandemic), and it was tough for me to break into any entry-level positions. After some time, I finally decided to accept an offer from a staffing firm's recruiter to work as an operations specialist for $33k, no bonuses or 401k match. The work-life balance was good, but over time I realized I didn't enjoy the work I was producing. To make matters worse, I found the place to be kind of toxic and it didn't help that my parents (i.e. grew up in a strict household with not much compassion for my personal life choices) couldn't support me emotionally here. So after 6 months in my role, I decided that it was time for a change.

And. It. Was. Hard...

At first of course! The first interviews didn't go as smoothly as I wanted them to...mostly because I was tense in answering qs about my background (i.e. lack of experience). However, after weeks of practicing for upcoming interviews in mirrors, revising my resume, devoting time to upskilling, and reading some good Reddit posts to keep my spirits high, I finally felt more confident during my interviews. Yet, dozens of rejections still came through no matter what stages I was in for the application process. Even became a victim of ghosting too like many others in this community...

But. I. Never. Gave. Up. Hope!

After more than a year of what felt like a depression cloud hanging over my head (aka sleepless nights, handling strenuous workloads from my toxic boss, parents reminding me how I'm a disappointment every now and then, looking at my low bank account and stressed out demeanor on non-interview days and just feeling AWFUL, etc.), an offer for me came through on one Tuesday morning while I was working.

After finishing the call with the company's recruiter, I just put my head down and cried. The offer (finance analyst) had everything I ever wanted since my graduation and even more:

*- $70,000+ annual salary with a 6-8% annual bonus (performance-dependent)*

*- WFH/Hybrid option; amazing benefits package and 401k match (4%)*

*- Chance to work with a major U.S. Tech company (Fortune 500)*

Nowadays, I'm breathing a little better with a head that has much clearer thoughts. Looking back at my journey since 2020, I can't believe I survived so much of what felt like hell since then. As April approaches, I'm really looking forward for what's to come in my new role. Sure, my imposter syndrome will be high and my anxiety levels too about how long I can sustain this dream...but right now I just want to believe that I'm making the right decision by leaping forward here with no regrets.

**TL;DR:** ***Covid grad that started in a dead-end job struggles in job search for a year before finding the perfect opportunity; Finally has peace of mind for financial/internal struggles and is ready to leave the past behind and walk into the bright future ahead.***

\^\^\^\^I hope my own personal experience here can bring hope and help those that are also struggling now with finding a job or a better job. No matter what age you are, where you come from, what industry you're in, or what personal struggles you're facing alone, know that it's okay to REST but ***DON'T YOU EVER GIVE UP!!! YOU WILL FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR! THERE IS A COMPANY OUT THERE THAT WILL SEE YOUR POTENTIAL! YOU DESERVE IT SO MUCH AND OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO TRY NO MATTER HOW HARD IT GETS!*** These are the exact words I told myself and it helped me in my journey because I believed in a vision no one else around me could see.

Thanks for reading my story. If you still need a mood booster, I suggest listening to some songs below for encouragement as you continue your job search journey (part of my motivation playlist):

However, their math and cs departments are not as good and I am worried about internship and recruitment opportunities. Might also consider grad school but going to Duke might erase that possibility.

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which left him waking up, surrounded by a mass of four-armed snakes surrounding him on all sides; decidedly not awesome. He couldn't breathe. Oh, God, he couldn't breathe! Ryan began flipping his shit, kicking and squirming, trying to free himself of the mass of scales and tails. 

He was hyperventilating, *bad*. Ryan felt their bodies smother him, squeezing him, closing in on-... he wormed his way out of them all, shooting into the open air in a panic. It took him a second before his breathing slowed back down. *Oh, fuck*. Ryan sat against the wall in the corner. Looking back up, he had woken up a few people. Mainly Gexie, who looked to be holding his side and wincing on each ""step"" he took from side to side. 

""Nmf, that hurt like hell!"" the Texan lizard exclaimed. ""You okay, Ryan?"" Ryan nodded. ""Gave me a helluva mornin' fright, that's fer sure. *And a mornin' bruise, too…*"" he muttered, gently moving his hand to reveal an already slightly bluish spot on his gut.

""Shit, I'm so sorry!"" Ryan pleaded. ""I didn't mean to… wh-... why did I wake up with you all on top of me???"" he questioned, confused and still a bit panicked. 

""Ah, a couple a' boys felt bad 'bout you sleepin' alone by yerself over there n' decided to move while ya were asleep,"" he explained. ""I, uh, see that might not've been th' best idea,"" Gexie conceded.

""Shit! I'm really sorry! You gonna be alright?"" Ryan worried. 

""Yea, should be fine,"" the burly lizard answered. ""Biggest bruise is jes' to my pride,"" he chuckled. ""But, anyways, you alright, yerself? I know we should'na dun that, but ya looked real lonely over there by yer lonesome!""

""Yeah,"" Ryan confirmed. ""I'm good. Just, don't do *this* again. Please,"" he begged. Ryan did *not* want to wake up to another lizard sarcophagus again. Gexie hugged his tail in guilt. Well now Ryan felt bad, damnit. *Think up a compromise!* he demanded of himself. 

""Well… I *suppose* it wouldn't be *that bad* so long as I was on the outside of the cuddle puddle,"" he reasoned. That seemed to brighten Gexie's mood a bit. ""... You all really like cuddling, don't you?"" Ryan questioned.

Eleanor's squad was making headway. Serious headway. They expected some resistance, or at least guards posted in their path that they would need to maneuver around or neutralize, but it seemed they had found the perfect little route to slip by to their target unnoticed. No one dared to utter a word for fear of breaking the lucky streak. He sweeped another corner with his MP5, carefully scanning every inch of the room. 

They made their way inside the ship, unseen by the security force that had the hunk of metal under its protection. It was still built like a rocket ship, since it needed to escape atmosphere, but it was armed to the teeth with some of the most expensive guns money could buy, kept a nuke that could be remotely armed and launched, and equipped with an FTL drive that could take them anywhere in the galaxy once it was out of atmosphere. Each and every one of them had trained months for this. They all took off their packs, swapping to their stolen spacesuits as fast as they could. Eleanor readied the radio in the cockpit. 

""Shuttle 2-9, ready for takeoff,"" he confirmed, doing his best impression of the man who was supposed to be team leader on the ship here today, but was instead drugged out of his mind in a hotel in Berlin. He flicked off the ship's radio, turning on his own instead. ""Agent, we're inside the target,"" he confirmed to their mysterious benefactor, codenamed Agent. The man on the other end simply swapped his radio on and off to signal ""copy"". Now what the hell did *Agent* need to keep quiet for? Well. He supposed it didn't matter much to himself. It didn't matter how much shit Agent could pin to him if he was in space. He chuckled to the rest of his men.

""A pirate's life for us, boys!"" he cheered as the thrusters kicked in, slowly sending them skyward.

_

Agent Bowler patiently waited. A hidden compartment of the ship had been stuffed below the medbay, which he had crammed himself into. It wasn't the best seating arrangements, but the walls were padded enough that he wouldn't break anything on atmospheric exit. He couldn't wait to see the looks on their faces when the assholes recieved their new job description."

I thought the first draft of my personal statement was the best thing I've ever read, but (spoiler alert !!) it wasn't. Keep writing drafts and get opinions from multiple people. We tend to overestimate and overrate ourselves. 
2. Study, it's good. Keep ya GPA up. 
3. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. That one Netflix show you want to binge? You can binge it after you finish writing your essays. I know it's hard, but let's work on self-discipline. All-nighters suck the life out of you, so give yourself plenty of time to work on everything. Keep an organized chart/sheet.
4. Your personality needs to SHINE throughout your app. ESPECIALLY in your essays. Think about it. Why should AOs accept you? YOU? Would YOU contribute to the school community? Would YOU be a great roommate? Would professors remember YOU?
5. There are NO targets. Just safeties or reaches. College admissions is a lottery.
6. I had the craziest college decisions process, just like the rest of y'all. Do NOT despair. If you didn't get in, that just means the school wasn't a fit for you. **Rejection —&gt; redirection**. Please fall in LOVE with your safeties. Nothing is ever guaranteed.
7. Easiest way to cope with rejections is to expect a rejection beforehand. If you expect to be disappointed, you won't be that disappointed.
8. DEMONSTRATED INTEREST. Go check on Common Data Set if the school you're applying to considers them. If yes, go attend info sessions. It's easier to learn more about the school and its vibes. Email your admissions counselor (with important questions only !!!). Go to virtual/in person tours. If you hate the campus, and can't imagine yourself living there, then it's not worth applying.
9. Don't apply to public/out-of-state schools. Sure, a rejection hurts, but not being able to afford a school hurts even more (Looking at you, UMich 😕….).
10. Being genuinely bitter and jealous is not gonna get you anywhere. Don't underestimate people. You don't know their stories and their applications. And please don't try to sabotage people and email AOs. You are actually a weirdo and a loser if you do that (unless they're racist, homophobic, violent, etc, or like actually a terrible person).
11. Have a hobby. Get off your phone. Go outside. Touch some grass. Shit, from August — February, my only personality trait was college admissions. Those were some miserable ass times. But I've recently gotten into painting and sewing, and it's been great &lt;3. It softens rejection blows and makes them way easier to deal with because you can just paint a cute lil painting after and be proud of it.
12. Even if it doesn't seem like it, someone out there is proud of you. I'm proud of you and everything you've achieved.
13. It is NOT the end of the world. You are NOT the opinion of your college results. You WILL do great things out there. You are only 16/17/18/19. You are young. Go have fun. College is only a blink of your life. Who knows what you'll be in 10, 20, 30 years ??!

**PS:** If anyone can tell me if public health is a STEM or social science field, lemme know."

**Letters of Recommendation (didn't ready any b/c of FERPA rights)**

Physics teacher- (7/10) Had her for both sophomore and junior year, uploaded it very quickly so idk but she's nice!! Asked a lot of questions in her classes

AP Euro/Gov teacher- (5/10) Only had her in-person beginning in this semester lolll, but did write her rec based off a paragraph I wrote to ""beef myself up"" so I'm assuming it was all right. Asked a lot of questions last year online too.

AP Lang Teacher- (6/10) Did some shady things to get to know me beyond just talking directly to me for some reason but hopefully it was for the greater good plus he's the kind of person to write a super nice rec letter out of morals anyways so it was probably aight

School counselor (7/10) Literally no idea but I think he's cool with me and I talked to him quite a bit so I'm giving it a 7

**Interviews**

MIT: 4/10 Nice lady but it was my first interview and I don't think I did too well b/c I was nervous

Princeton: 6.5/10 Super nice lady who made me fall in love with Princeton LOL, I got to talk about ""why Princeton"" which I'd pretty much failed to do(too non-specific) in the actual supp essay

UMich: 8/10 Nice guy and I got to touch on everything I wanted, most comfortable interview

UPenn: 6/10 Cool guy that wasn't even in living in North America at the time?? I totally messed up w/ ""tell me about yourself"" but otherwise it was solid plus I made him laugh, made me fall in love w/ UPenn too

Stanford: 7/10 Super awesome guy that asked by far the most and most specific questions which I liked a lot tbh, I could feel his love for his time at Stanford

**Essays**

Common App Essay: Wrote two diff ones, used depending on the short essays for each college, one was more personal and about self-growth, the other was just about what I've done in high school that really orients towards my prospective major(s) lol

Supplements for privates: favorite single essay I wrote was about Nifflers, got rejected from both schools that received it though :(, I think my ""why us"" essays were probably the strongest in general

UC Essays: 

Wrote about hobbies, mental health, extracurriculars

I think my common app essays were both decent at the least, the personal one was kind of corny though but I still loved it. The value of my supplements definitely varied. I think my UC essays probably made me seem kind of weird but they weren't bad.

**Decisions** 

Acceptances:

* Cornell (CAS)
* UPenn(SEAS)
* UCLA (letters &amp; sciences)
* NYU (CAS)
* UIUC (Grainger)
* UW-Madison
* Uni of Iowa
* Uni of MN-Twin Cities

* Columbia
* USC
* UC Berkeley
* MIT
* Harvard

Still awaiting Stanford but I'm very happy with my choices and a lot of my friends are going to college in the northeast so!! I feel so lucky LMAO because I don't have those crazy stats with International level stuff and internships and whatever and I also don't really have leadership or creating clubs/organizations , but if I can get into ivies and a UC without all of that stuff, so can you! Don't lose hope just because you don't match the insane level of the ""ideal applicant."" Do the best with what you've got and it will show!

Also I didn't have my college stuff together until Nov/Dec, like not even a complete college list, so please do not be like me. Free online resources/articles for learning how to write essays were sososo helpful for me (so don't worry if you can't afford those like 10k essay writers), even though I only started using them in December, again do not be like me. My Yale REA essays were genuinely horrific, so remember, and I cannot stress this enough and I don't care if this is stereotypical advice: start everything about this process early!

Update: rejected Stanford, congrats to any who got in!!!!!!"

2. Debate 4yrs . Probably my most stacked EC. Debate Captain my sophomore year, Treasurer Junior year, and president senior year. 2x national qualifiers and 5th at state junior year. Grew the club a bunch (NSDA top 100's award). TOC, etc.

2. State Champ and ICDC qualifier in DECA.
3. Volunteering award
4. Superior Distinction, NSDA. Over 1000 points earned
5. Some national Jazz band festival dub.

**LOR's**

1. STEM teacher from my AP physics junior year. She really liked me because I would like talk with her in online school and as we went back in person I sat in the front, stayed and chatted afterwards. She told me that of all the students who she wrote recs for, I was the most qualified. Got A's in her classes, overall good student.
2. Debate coach / teacher. She was my 4 year debate coach and I also had her as a teacher. I think that my work and extreme commitment to debate really made her like me. We spent so much time at tournaments that I felt that she could write some great things about me. A's in her classes, and overall had an amazing bond.
3. English teacher from junior year. Good overall teacher, she was super friendly and like me because I did good work in her class. I participated and talked with her a lot. Our families are also really close due to older sibling relationships so that might've helped too.

**Interviews**

Interviewed with basically all the ivies (-cornell) and schools like NW and MIT. I think they all went phenomenal. Im a very social person, I got a lot of internship opportunities through like randomly DM'ing people on like linkedin and scheduling calls. Debate has also definitly helped with confidence in public speaking.  I talked with my Princeton guy for about two hours and had to cut it short because I had to go to practice.

**Essays**

Side note, I had the world reading my essays. Friends who had gotten into their ED's, A counselor who was super expensive, and my sister who had gotten into multiple T20's and currently studies CS with a pre-law track at Berkeley.

CommonApp ; I wrote about cooking and like how it went from something as simple as making a meal to like ways that I bridged into new communities. Talk about experimentation from the times that I worked in a pizza kitchen/boba shop, bringing those recipes online and eventually getting exposed to new people and traditions. basically using my online presence to uplift others and to like be happy etc.

My why major supps were basically like talking about public policy and how @ debate I saw the impact that policy had on individuals in the US and studying poly sci would eventually make me better at the subject so that I could help people. Somewhat generic coming from a debater but they weren't bad.

The creative supps I talked about Jazz and music and how playing jazz (improvisation) allowed me to be expressive and speak my mind and put like my emotions into music.

**Final Thoughts**

It was never about the quality of education but really living up and pleasing my parents. I know that the education I will get from UW, specifically their CS department will be amazing but I do feel bad.  Both my parents got into great schools like CalTech but couldn't go due to their families being extremely poor so having me go to one of those schools has kinda always been a dream of theirs. I feel really bad, knowing that I don't have the restraints that they did but just couldn't come up victorious.

&amp;#x200B;

Life goes on. UW is a great school."

2. Another Magnet Teacher - Known all 4 years of high school as well, good relationship overall and also assisted with research, 9/10

**Interviews**

1. Harvard - Literally lasted 15-20 minutes. Interview really didn't offer much to keep the conversation going and I felt like he was in a rush. Also came in like 30 mins late to my interview smh. He was very intrigued about how much Ik about harvard considering my brother went there.
2. Yale - It was very chill. Interview just graduated so she was able to relate to alot of the conversation. I felt like I fumbled though when she asked ""Why would you choose Yale over MIT, Stanford, or other top CS school?"" because I wasn't really expecting that. Otherwise, it went fairly well.
3. Princeton - Very very good interview. Really had a good conversation and definitely went over the expected time talking about Netflix shows
4. Dartmouth - Interviewer was really cool. Talked about his time back in his day when he swam in boats to other parts of Dartmouth to hook up with girls (school was male-only at the time) which I found hilarious. He said he would put in a special word since I was the best person he has ever interviewed. Told me to go to Princeton or Harvard if I get in lmao.
5. Duke (Finalist Interview) - Definitely butchered this whole interview. I was very unprepared and really folded under pressure. Kept stuttering and trying hard to answer their very specific questions. By the time I had done this interview, I was just notified of the Columbia news so I was very distracted and they could definitely tell.
6. MIT - I tried to be positive throughout the interview but the interviewer just simply didn't seem to like me. Would always say ""stop trying to impress me"" when I literally was just telling her my life story. Her husband fell in the middle of our interview so she took 15-20 mins to help him up. After that, she emailed me a list of her favorite books and said she had to go.
7. Stanford - Decent interview, took about 30-45 mins talking about things really unrelated to Stanford like Netflix, soccer, etc. Thought I would get in after that interview ngl.

**Essays**

Won't go into too much details, but I wrote my personal essay about something that is very specific to me incorporating how past unique experiences shaped me to go into CS. Also for individual college essays, I tied all my extracurriculars to my main passion for research as you may notice.

**Additional Information:**

I also got the Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship!

Looking back, I would have put more effort into my essays EA. Honestly, I believe essays are the most important part of your application. Don't procrastinate on them and really put thought into them to make them unique. Those Stanford essays were very specific and I probably didn't answer them well as I didn't put much thought into them. Same with UNC Chapel Hill. After EA, I definitely went back and revised all my essays and perfecting my personal essay. Last thing, trust the process. Although, you may get rejected EA/RD to some schools but that does not mean all hope is lost. You can definitely still get into other schools that might even be considered ""higher ranked."" Good luck, yall!

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lit/Lang Teacher: **9/10**. My favorite teacher and the teacher that knows me the best, so she was able to write a super personal LOR. She was able to connect my characteristics to aspects about me that not many people know about.

AP Bio: Had him my sophomore year, but he moved away after that so I never had him again (that was also the year Covid struck so I didn't even have him for a full year). He was by far the best science teacher I've ever had and also the most influential teacher I've had. I didn't get to read the LOR he wrote me so I don't have a rating for it.

**Interviews**

Yale - Yale was the only interview that I had. I think that I was too timid and I wish I would spoken more/asked more questions. My interviewer was super nice and friendly, but I'm not sure what she thought of me.

**Essays**

My essay topic was kinda cliché, but I wrote about how growing up in a small, rural, predominantly white, southern town affected my relationship with my culture and the lessons I learned from my experience. I'm actually really proud of my essay because it encapsulates a struggle that I endured for many years, so it's very personal to me. I only had two people edit my essay (my AP lit teacher and my mom's friend who is a college prof) and they both thought it was a well written essay.

I put time into what I actually wanted to do and it paid off. I also made sure to draw clear connections between my ECs and my essays, transforming what may seem like scattered, bizarre activities into unique, meaningful passions. Thanks for reading!"

ttipt9,10,2022-04-01,Am I stupid to pay for a Master's in Computer Science?,g-unit2,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ttipt9/am_i_stupid_to_pay_for_a_masters_in_computer/,"**Background**

I have attended a California State University for the last 4 years. I studied Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. As I made the transition to an upperclassman, I noticed my courses were more engaging, less outdated, and more applicable. I began to enjoy school more. I was required to write an essay on a ""hypothetical masters program"" in a GE I took a junior year. The seed was planted in my head that pursuing a master's degree might be interesting and a positive stepping stone in my career. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I want to get a Master's in Computer Science**

I'm well aware that this is NOT needed to become a software engineer. I have fallen in love with Backend Software Engineering. My career goal is to be a Staff/Principle Software Engineer. Why? It seems cool, it will push me to reach my full potential as an SWE. I've always have liked to push myself. I also understand there are a million factors at play that are currently out of my control as a 22-year-old who is graduating with a B.S. this May... it's just a goal for me.

I've done some brief research and noticed that it's quite beneficial to have a higher-level degree if you want to reach this caliber of SWE. That's a primary motivation for this endeavor. 

My father, an engineer, has accounted multiple times that he regrets not pursuing his master's and was thrilled and proud when I told him I wanted to.

I have often heard it's difficult to go back to school once you start working full-time and make decent money. Another reason I would like to knock this out now and not get sidetracked. 

I have been told by others I have above-average leadership and interpersonal skills (mostly when compared to other computer geeks) and I really see myself becoming a manager at some point when I either reach my engineering potential or a management position looks more appealing. I certainly could see myself pursuing an MBA as well while employed later down the road before I make the jump over to management. (Again this is probably 10+ years out, I'm just making strong assumptions for this post).

A master's degree will ALWAYS be on my resume, whereas my first entry-level development job may not in 5+ years.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Professional Experience**

I landed an internship at a small startup company my Junior summer and was exposed to AWS cloud and the power of cloud computing. 

For the past two years, I have been building a mobile application on the iOS platform with a few colleagues I met at my university. I handle all the architecture for cloud solutions, database design, security, and scalability of the application. In my most recent endeavor, I built out a cloud environment on AWS where I deployed a load-balanced auto-scaling EC2 group that hosts a RESTful Django API. The API is hooked up to a PostgreSQL database managed with RDS.

I built this because we were running the entire application off of Google Cloud Firestore (a NoSQL Document database) and were facing a lot of query limitations which prevented the development of some new features. Additionally, we are going to add more robust data analytics to make more informed product decisions and implement content suggestions via some Machine Learning. (I haven't begun throughout research on that yet so sorry if I sound dumb. I was just trying to lay a foundation to make that possible).

 I'm now integrating CI/CD with AWS code deploy for zero downtime API services for our application and we can implement testing builds as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I stated my Professional Experience**

I didn't say all that to try and ""flex"". Instead, I started my experience as background for my current position. I think I am one of the more prepared Computer Science students in my class to go out and land a Software Development job but I want to get my master's. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why am I having these thoughts?**

I ask a lot of questions for the average CS undergrad, some of them are a little more advanced since I like researching in my free time. Anyways, this caught the attention of one of my peers and they offered to give me a referral to their company. It's a large reputable company in the area and it would be a good experience to work there. 

As we started talking I stated that I enjoy backend development and he advised I do something else because ""X makes more money, and it's better anyways"" and when I stated that I have been accepted for multiple master's programs starting in the fall he said, ""a master's is totally unnecessary in software"" I brushed these things off because I wanted the referral and I know that was just unnecessary opinion sharing. 

I followed up with I'm and said something similar to: ""hey I looked at company X careers page, a there's a lot of interesting opportunities. I also would like to apply for an internship since I am still seriously considering the masters. perhaps the internship may continue into the academic year"" He then replied with:

How are you funding this? Your parents, scholarships, loans... ""I'm just going to lay it on you, most people have a full-time job and have their company pay for their masters.""

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts**

Am I overanalyzing this sample size of 1? I feel like I am pursuing my master's for all the right reasons. I know that it is not beneficial in the short term. I will start seeing the benefit as I get promoted.

I'm extremely fortunate and my family has the ability to fund my master's. Additionally, the university I am most likely going to attend is under 16K tuition for the whole master's. Housing is the only out-of-pocket expense and I was planning on being a TA and trying to secure some additional part-time backend development work to fund my life."

I was happy about my internship I just got and then all of a sudden I get some people saying I'm receiving way too little and getting explored by the company. To clue you guys in it's a start-up that is basically only 3 years old and growing pretty rapidly. I'm going to be one of the first members of the data science team from there and I've had a conversation with the owner of the company who seemed to like me a lot, I mean a LOT!

I don't get it, I thought since it was a startup they wouldn't be paying me that much and that my focus should be 100% on experience and 0% on money, but I'm getting a couple of people saying that the amount I'm receiving isn't reasonable and that I should value myself more blablabla. When I research on the internet it seems to be quite the norm this value actually.

Do you guys honestly think money is important for an intern? And if you do, wouldn't you say that working on startups by itself already implies you're going to start receiving considerably less than the norm?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Biology Teacher (8/10): I took Honors and AP Biology with this teacher consecutively (9th and 10th grade). Although I was somewhat close to him, we were always detached in a sense, but he had the most to write about me because I had him for so long.(also bc we did a ridiculous number of labs). His LORs are known for not being the best in general, but this is definitely the academic rec.

MUN Coach and AP Psychology Teacher (9/10): Getting this teacher to do my LOR was unique because she talked not only from a class, academic standpoint but was also able to talk about my leadership as president of the club. I only had her senior year, so she had very little to write about but I gave her some points to talk about and in combination with the MUN experience, I think she was able to cover my personality and much more of my true self than the previous teacher could.

Counselor (10/10): I gave my counselor almost 10 pages worth of information about myself to use when writing the rec. If this LOR wasn't perfect, I don't know what could be. Even though we have rarely met, these counselor write so many recs using info they collect from students and have plenty of competitive school acceptances so I'm sure they know what they're doing.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

*Princeton: 3/5, the interview went poorly as I couldn't relate to the interviewer much.*

*Harvard: 4/5, I actually loved this interview as I got to talk about a lot of things I didn't mention in my application. However, that's a red flag considering the AOs probably didn't take what I said as a key consideration in my application, which was not the case for other schools.*

Duke: Chose not to do the interview.

UPenn: 4/5, Interviewer was super old and a retired professor. We were both South Asian and I was able to hook him on that aspect. Overall, this one was a bit short though.

*Videos for UChicago and Brown: I did not do these at all.*

**Essays**

Main personal statement: 9/10, My common app essay was an auto-bibliography about my experiences being ostracized by both Western and Muslim peers as a muslim trans person. I wrote about how I've taken this opportunity to better myself and take direct in my world to change for myself and resist falling into the spiral of depression and failure society wants to force on people like me. Overall I would say this was a 9/10, it was very well written, emotional, and intellectual. I spent several months polishing this. In the end I probably had somewhere around 30 versions.

Supplementary Essays: 9/10, I rarely reviewed my supplements after the first few. However I'm more of an on-the-spot writer and can writing a good essay without needing to edit it much. This definitely saved me a lot of time. I also focused a lot more on actual ideas and plans for the future rather than invigorating and pretty prose. Considering I applied to about 15 schools, I didn't spend much time on these.

The pay is not very good though as they only offer minimum wage. I didn't get other offer so I accepted this one. 
I am wondering, however, why these big corporations don't pay as good as some start-ups as I have seen on LinkedIn that there are start-ups pay as much as 2800 euros per month for a software intern. In my home country and I believe in US, big corporate usually pays better. What are the explanations for this?

note: previously, I got paid 13 euros per hour in an autonomous driving start-up with a non developer role as working student, I am not sure how the developer intern is paid but they certainly earn more than 13"

I’m a university student, and I graduated from high school with stellar grades, but ever since I started university, I haven’t understood a single course, followed a single lesson: if I have gotten a good grade, it was pure chance. I wasn’t like this, in my teenage years I used to be very principled, strong willed and disciplined, but since my second year of university (Sept 2020), I’ve completely changed. 

I feel like I live in the shell of who I used to be, I don’t recognise myself on most days, and I absolutely hate who I’ve become. I’ve also been struggling with some serious issues with getting work done. It’s one of the reasons I’ve performed so badly in university; I just can’t bring myself to work. Last summer I had an internship, but I couldn’t complete it because I just couldn’t work. I knew I had deadlines, and I would sit down to work, I would stare at my screen for hours, get nothing done, and then convince myself that this was useless, I wasn’t in the mood and that I would pull an all nighter to finish the work. And then I wouldn’t. It’s not just work either, on days that I’ll set up a goal to study, I’ll end up cleaning my house; on days that I set up the goal to study, I’ll ask a friend out for coffee and spend the whole day outside. It seems like for whatever reason, whenever I set my mind up to something, no matter how motivated I am, I can’t work, and the guilt that follows makes me feel anxious and depressed.

My self confidence is gone. I don’t feel like myself anymore, it’s been so long that I haven’t felt like myself that I don’t even know who I used to be, who I’d like to be, nothing. Everyday I wake up and it’s so hard to convince myself to get out of bed, because I can’t make myself see the good. I feel like a failure. 

Im going to therapy, it helps, but i feel like there’s something more I need. I thought that maybe I have ADHD, and I saw a psychiatrist for it. However, it went really bad because he pretty much assumed im trying to get diagnosed so I can get my hands on amphetamines (Im studying in Europe too and they don’t do adult ADHD diagnosis). I don’t, i would opt not to go on meds, but I feel like I’ve exhausted every solution there could be and I got no results, and maybe medication might help.

I don’t know what to do. I’m on the verge of giving up, I really feel helpless. Sometimes I don’t know if I’m making all this up in my head as an excuse to not work. I don’t think I am; I do want to work, I want to be productive. But at this point my brain is fried, I feel like I have no command over myself, so I don’t know what’s going on in my head. 

If anyone could offer some advise, share their experience if they had something similar, or anything really, I would appreciate it so much!!"

I would love to hear your opinions/suggestions on this dilemma. I am currently open to pursuing PhD or a research role at a company after graduation. Field of research: mostly ML/AI.

In addition, I have some specific queries:

1. Just from looking at QSRanking EPFL (9 in CS in 2021) ranks higher than UTAustin (28 in CS in 2021). But in terms of research, csrankings site rates UTAustin higher than EPFL. But these rankings don't simply help me make out anything.
2. Both are reputed universities. And I understand one will have to learn French to live in Switzerland. And being an international student (Asian) I might have less job opportunities after graduation from EPFL while the same is not true in case of UT Austin. I would love if someone can corroborate this understanding.
3. From an academic standpoint, EPFL seems a very course heavy MS program with also good research opportunities. So both these makeup to provide a solid foundation for a PhD. But at the same time, I have seen a lot of people extend their MS tenure to 2.5 yrs in EPFL to better manage their course/curriculum load or pursue a 6-month industry intern.
4. In terms of cost, EPFL has negligible tuition fee and that leads to it costing nearly half the cost in comparison to UTAustin. 

PS: I am also awaiting decisions on GATech, UBC and NYU Courant. Apart from GATech, should I under any circumstances consider the other two? If yes, please provide those situations, for example funding (highly improbable) could be one.

PPS: I would have waited a little more to post this after getting the other results. But UTAustin requires a decision to be made by 15 April.

TIA."

**Context:** Hey! I’m a gap year student from the Philippines. I graduated high school last year and applied to a couple of US colleges for Fall 2021, and as you can guess based on the post’s title, it didn’t quite work out for me. But since 9th grade, I knew I wanted to take a gap year regardless of my results—and it just so happened that I didn’t get into an affordable school that I would be happy to attend…so I decided to try again.

It was scary, I’ll tell you that. I was risking two years of my life to a process that is essentially a gamble. I didn’t even have a local back-up school (fun fact I forgot that the deadline for my local school was in January and I only realized that on March 17 💀) though I did have a couple of options should everything go south for me. And I also had a little bit of *hope*—of the 8 US schools I applied to last year, I was accepted at Bentley University (though I’d have to pay more than my family’s annual income) and waitlisted at Vanderbilt. These results meant that I had a chance, no matter how small. And a chance was all I needed.

**Letters of Recommendation**

* **Math teacher - 8/10** (taught me in 12th grade only, but she saw a lot of my good qualities and I did a lot of creative stuff in her projects, wanted to show creativity in arts despite being STEM)
* **English teacher - 9/10** (also only taught me in 12th grade, but she absolutely loved me (and I love her a lot too!!) and was so ready to sing praises abt me as a sci communicator. She was so happy to hear I was going to go into scicomm hahaha)
* **CS/Research teacher - 7/10** (CS teacher in 8th grade, research adviser from 11th-12th. He saw a lot of my resourcefulness and abilities as a leader through the whole research process)
* **College-prep oriented org VP - 8/10** (worked with them extensively on graphics and events, we’re also friends outside of work so they knew me well. Wanted their letter to focus on work ethic and responsibility)

**Interviews**

I had 6 non-scholarship interviews: MIT, Macalester, Kenyon, Smith, Cornell, UPenn. All of my interviews were fun and interesting (especially Macalester), but I got rejected from all of the schools, so 😭 is my personality that bad? 😔

**Essays**

Went for a metaphor + EC personal statement 😳 but I tried to be kinda lowkey about my EC. I never talked about numbers, only people, and I never said the name of the EC. I also used trains as a metaphor because I looooove trains. Trains are so cool, y’all. Anyway, the whole point of the essay was to highlight my love for the intersection of STEM and the Humanities. 

Gap year essay was also pretty strong imo 🥺 I doubled down on the STEM x Humanities theme going on in my personal statement and talked about how I worked on that interest during my gap year (events, awards, etc.). I’m also proud of the ending of my essay, where I say that my gap year made me realize just how much I thrive in the classroom environment, and that I’m so excited to go back to school to learn together with others!!

Meanwhile my supplementals were ✨ reduced, reused, recycled ✨ and often rushed. Kinda sucks because my favorite essay—which was about flat earthers—didn’t get me into any schools :(( (disclaimer: I am not a flat earther hahaha)

Additional information section included 4 of my favorite research studies I’ve written throughout my school life, and specific gap year activities and awards I was unable to include in the common app EC/honors list

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Full 61-decision list can be found on [this imgur link](https://imgur.com/wKQObSY). This would be too long a post if I included everything 💀 so I’ll put only my notable results here. (Ah, and none of my other acceptances are affordable, unfortunately.)

Summary: 13 W’s / 8 WL’s / 40 L’s

* **Vanderbilt University EDI** \- Rejected (after being WL’d last year in RD)
* **Rollins College RD/Priority** \- Accepted, Alfond Scholar Finalist, shortlisted/waitlisted for Alfond, 40k/yr
* 🌟 **Washington and Lee University RD** \- Accepted, Johnson Scholar Finalist, did not get Johnson, 86k/yr 
* 🌟 **Colby College RD** \- Accepted, 79k/yr  –&gt; appealed and raised to 80k/yr!!
* **New York University RD** (AD first, NYC second) - Waitlisted, invited for Candidate Weekend 3 (I’ve got beef with NYUAD because of this 😤)
* **All Ivies I applied to** \- Rejected 🤩

**Additional Information:**

In case you’re curious - I got my Colby and W&amp;L decision on March 18th (W&amp;L releases decisions a week early to Johnson finalists), one day after realizing I missed the deadline for a local school. Just when I thought it was all over for me, hahaha.

Ultimately, I’m very very grateful that I’m able to write this post. I’ve spent months and months and *months* of anxious reeling and pacing around my house, arguing with my parents about my career choices, and crying over deadlines and stress and essays. I am so, *so* glad it worked out somehow. I know I’m one of the lucky ones; lucky enough to have gotten incredible support from my mentors and my parents and my friends; lucky enough to have had the time to focus and work on this crazy, wonderful process; lucky enough that the stars aligned just right that a bunch of AOs from two different schools thought, “this kid is worth it.” 

Thank you to everyone on the different college application subreddits. From r/sat, to r/applyingtocollege, to r/intltousa, to this sub itself - each one has been an incredible help in this long journey of mine. I’ll try my best to keep in touch with the friends I’ve made and help out wherever I can (and yes, feel free to reach out any time!). To my fellow CO2026 - congratulations for overcoming this wild, wild ride; I am so proud of us all. And to rising seniors and juniors and anyone who is yet to embark on their college apps process - good luck, and enjoy the journey 💙🤍"

While I have no problem with this concept, it always strikes me a little odd considering that my perception of working in tech is possibly a nice shirt as all my coworkers at my internship wear t shirts and flannels. 

I have yet to have an interview where the interviewer was nicely dressed. I have had several that wear t-shirts or polos and today I had one that did not even join the call with video... (while I wore a suit and tie). Is this normal for interviews or is this because it is only for an entry level role?"
ttknft,15,2022-04-01,Maximizing Total Compensation — Short Guide for Incoming CS Majors,SpaceExplorer10220,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/ttknft/maximizing_total_compensation_short_guide_for/,"CS/CSE Majors - READ!


There is a serious lack of advice for a decent chunk of CS students. Specifically, the ~10% of you CS majors that are heavily career-oriented and those that want to maximize salary or total compensation (aka base salary + stocks + bonuses. aka total money every year).

**If you do not care much about maximizing total compensation out of college as a CS major, then please ignore this post.**

The advice below is for CS incoming freshman but many can be applied to current CS students.

High starting total compensation ($200k+) in the tech industry is solely dependent on how much you can grind during your time in college. Very meritocratic and uni rankings don’t play much of a role apart from quant firm recruitment. You’ll either end up with 150-300k offers out of college if you grind for 1-3 good internships, or you’ll end up with a 80-100k offers if you end up fucking around as a CS student.

Summer 2023 apps begin ~July-September for big tech and quant and will continue till around Jan/Feb, smaller and mid sized companies will open later and continue until March-ish. Big tech and top unicorns like FAANG, Uber, Microsoft, Stripe, etc. will pay $40-70/hr for internships. Top quant/trading firms like Jane Street and Hudson River Trading and Optiver will pay $60-100/hr. Mid-sized and nontech or startups will pay $25-30/hr. All $ for software engineering internships. Combined with free housing and signing bonuses, you can make $20-60,000 USD max from the best internships such as at Amazon or Hudson River Trading in one summer.

Leetcode starting now and start building projects and you’ll have a shot at FAANG SWE freshman summer. Self study data structures and algorithms. Neetcode on youtube is very helpful.

You first freshman internship will likely be at a non tech mid sized company or startup, take it and learn as much as possible. Don’t worry about the pay. Getting any SWE internship will make it that much easier to land big tech interviews come your sophomore or junior year.

Also apply to freshman programs like Google STEP, Amazon Propel, etc… Its a pipeline to their SWE internship programs for ur sophomore year. Though if you start leetcode and projects rn, FAANG freshman summer isn’t impossible. I’ve seen it been done before (Freshman @ Apple, Freshmen @ Amazon, Freshmen @ Uber) though I don’t know any at Davis. (But there is a reddit post from a UCD sophomore that landed Optiver ($96/hr) and Amazon and others)

General ballpark: Freshman year expect to send 150-500 internship applications before your first offer. Sophomore year expect 50-150 if you have 1 internship, 150-400 if you have none. Junior year expect 30-60 if you have 2 internships already or 80-150 if you have none. If you have AP credits coming in as a freshman and by credits you are a sophomore, apply as a sophomore (so a graduation date of 2025). Same for sophomore-junior. Also, companies rarely check grad date / transcripts. 

SWE opportunities are most abundant. Data Science usually requires MS and is more niche (less positions) but similar pay. ML requires PhD usually so get good at math and stats and keep a 3.6+ for grad school.

Know that Summer is not the only chance to intern. You have Fall and Spring internships that a lot of big tech companies over. Take advantage of this and apply for these as well (unless you’re an international student in which case you can’t). 

You do not need a 4.00 to get internship offers. You need a good resume and leetcode skills. 3.5+ GPA is mostly only important for top quant firms and niche unicorns. A 3.3 is fine.

You do not need any big tech internships in fact to land high offers. Its just that internship(s) at big tech make it *much* easier to land big tech for full time positions. Ideally you want FAANG/Top unicorns your sophomore summer and junior summer latest obviously.

CS recruitment at Davis is trash. Don’t rely on it. Also, again, school doesn’t play too big of a role in the tech industry. 

Focus on ECS 36A/B/C and ECS 122A. They will build foundations and the latter (and 36C) will build strong baseline algorithmic knowledge for leetcoding if you don’t want to self study. 

Oh, if you’re an international student on an F-1 visa looking to work in the US post grad, work your fucking ass off. It is much harder for you guys to land internships and offers.

General advice: 
* **Hang out with motivated, ambitious, driven, and smart people**. Who you surround yourself with is who you will become. These people are those that often help others on your CS Discord server, those that go to OH and seem to ask good questions, those that sit in the front of the classroom, those that talk to professors outside of class, those that get 4.0s. Orgs like ICPC or DCSC or CodeLab are also good to join but don’t let any org or activity eat up your time. Time is what you need the most (leetcode + projects).

* Browse r/csMajors to find like minded people and to understand the process better. Check levels.fyi to see pay across companies

* Go to hackathons once or twice to build friends and have fun. Have a goal and work towards it everyday. Workout, eat good food, have a good time. 

Good luck and don’t burn out. Remember money isn’t everything and have fun in your CS classes! 

P.S. Take Butner for ECS 36A and ECS 36B! You’ll learn a lot"

Currently I am set to graduate in fall with my B.S. in Cybersecurity as well as currently working on getting my Sec+ cert. I have 0 experience in the IT field though I have applied to some internships (have not heard back from them yet). Throughout my time in college the skills I have learned are:

C++ Programming  
Java Programming  
Linux cmd  
Windows cmd  
Powershell  
Ghidra basics  
Wireshark  
Security Onion  
Kibana  
SQL Management Studio  
RStudio  
Metasploit  
Metasploitable 3

As well as I have general knowledge of things like the 7 OSI layers, SYN-ACK, malware, viruses, attacks (SQL injection, zero-day, etc).

With metasploitable 3 I know its intentionally vulnerable but it has allowed me to learn about reconnaissance, execution, and persistence and what to look for in the Security Onion, Wireshark, and Kibana. It has also allowed me to have a lot more time with the Linux terminal and familiarize myself with commands other then basic usage like nmap, netscan, grep, cat, etc . We have also done a CTF.

I know experience is king and I'm certainly not looking at getting a 6 figure job upon graduation but would I be able to land a tier 1 SOC Analyst job or a Jr. Cyber Analyst job if I don't get an internship? If I need to start at the help desk then so be it I'm really just looking to get into anything IT related.

On top of getting my Sec+ cert and looking for an internship is there anything else I can be doing? I have read to do TryHackMe as well as participate in CTFs. Perhaps another cert I could be looking at? Thank you."

First post here. I graduated in Finance this January and have been having a terrible time finding a job that pays decent. Everything pays either way too low or is commission. By too low I mean below average starting salary for the positions, and even then may or may not work out.

With the constant rejection, I’ve been thinking of adding 3 months of internship or job experience from a foreign country. I am a US citizen but travel home every year or two, and was wondering if I’d get caught in background checks doing this. Just one 3 month position.

The country is on the other side of the world and is a small, third world country. Just looking for opinions. Is this risky or will I be fine?

Thank you very much for your help in advance! I’m eager to get some opinions.

I got admits from both the universities and its difficult for me to choose between them. I need some help from this community.

**My background/profile:**

* International student (from a Tier-1 university in India) with a non-CS undergrad and no full time work experience. I have some relevant industrial and research experience in ML along with couple of relevant publications. 
* I'm looking to move to industry after Master's and base my career in AI.

**My viewpoints:**

* I want to work in US at some point of time in my career since I believe the opportunities in AI are very good. However, I'm still not sure about working in US with the H1B route. So my plan was  to get Canadian citizenship and work in US with TN1 visa \[I also want to  know how easy is this route\].
* Program wise, I feel the MScAC at Toronto is better, especially because of its 8 month applied research internship. This program is expensive, but the internship helps to recover most of the tuition fees and accommodation.
* UMass does not provide me with any financial aid like TAship. But I felt its RoI would be higher than Toronto given its reputation in US.
* Living expenses are very high in Toronto and tech-hubs of Canada in general. Add to this high taxes and lower salaries compared to US. Thus, I'm not sure about the quality of life / savings in the long-run as compared to US.
* Weather is harsh in Toronto, but I'm not sure how much I should factor this. I  have never experienced a temperature below 15 C yet.

At this point, its seems to basically boil down to a typical US vs Canada problem. I would really appreciate if anyone who had been through a similar situation / have an idea about it to help me make a decision. 

Thanks.

ttr0h9,21,2022-04-01,[Rant] Uni student feeling like I'm wasting my potential,a_violet_bellflower,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ttr0h9/rant_uni_student_feeling_like_im_wasting_my/,"Okay so basically what the title says. I'm aware that I lead quite a privileged life. Other than some bullying back in pri sch (which is so long ago I'm starting to feel like bringing it up just feels like an excuse), I have no relationship/family/life issues. My family is fairly well-off, not rich but enough that my parents can fund my uni fees without difficulty. I'm very book-smart, so I've gotten good grades all my life and never struggled to get into my schools of choice. I graduated with 88.75 rp and got into my first choice (an engin course) at NUS.

Except, I'm just passively cruising through life and I feel like I'm just wasting my potential. It sounds stupid especially with all the people out there preaching about not to compare with other people but I just can't help it. It doesn't help that I'm living with a sibling who is opposite of me in every way. 

It's even worse because when we were young, I got better grades and thus was seen as smarter than them.
But later in life when hard work and effort became more important than just being smart, they overtook me and ended up being way more accomplished. (What's the only rp better than 88.75? 90rp of course. That's what they got.) Maybe this is where I started feeling like I was wasting my potential, because I was able to be better than them when I was younger, so the fact that I'm worse now is just my own fault and I can't blame my own skills or birth.

One thing that has been plaguing me lately is the fact that they told me I was stupid for not applying for the NUS merit scholarship back when I entered uni.... at that time I was scared of the interview and whether it would be competitive (I still am towards other opportunities like this) and so didn't bother applying, only for my sibling to tell me that I had just wasted my chance to get free money. Now I just feel really stupid too, especially since NUS doesn't have similar mid-term scholarships. I feel like I got such a high rp and wasted it.

Same for right now. I have a fairly okay CAP ~4.5, and I am feeling a lot of pressure to get an internship or something. Here I have to clarify that the pressure is completely self-sourced. Even my friends seeing me so stressed over it ask me whether it's compulsory. It's not (at least a summer internship isn't), but I feel like I need to prove myself somehow. You would expect such a stressed person to be aggressively applying for internships, but I didn't. (Lol). I feel the same fear of interviews/responsibilities and didn't apply much. It doesn't help that I feel like I'm too picky about internships and want to choose one related to my major, but that narrows down the scope a lot (how many engin internships are there out there?)

Plus, I have very low self-esteem in myself. I've almost never held any leadership positions and I see my academics as my only selling point (which everyone says isn't worth much in the long run). At the same time I don't have enough confidence to actually take up the responsibility and apply for a real leadership position. This is partially the reason why I'm so stressed about getting internship experience because I feel like it's one of the only things that I might be able to sell myself with in the future. (Not that I'll probably be able to get an internship now that it's already April.)

When it comes to internships and programmes, I constantly have this mindset that ""it must be competitive, it must be hard to get"" and I end up scaring myself away from applying, only to get told later that it wasn't that hard. That's what happened with the NUS merit scholarship. I'm aware of this behaviour but I don't know how to stop it and I find myself hating myself more and more over it.

Lately I feel that I'm becoming more and more negative. Whenever I have time to think about my future I just slip back into this frame of mind and I just end up procrastinating and wasting time to distract myself. Sometimes I wonder if I should get help or see NUS's therapist or something, but at the same time I don't feel like my state is so bad that it warrants help. This is also stupid, because I desperately feel like I want help, but it also feels like I don't deserve it because there is nothing technically wrong with me?? I don't know what to think anymore. 

I don't even know how I want people to respond to me. Do I want people to scold me for acting so stupid, because that's what I deserve (although it makes me feel bad)? Do I want people to comfort me (although I don't deserve that and so makes me feel bad too)? So I just keep it to myself most days. I feel very bad when I talk to my friends and some of this negativity starts leaking out.


TL;DR 
Feeling like I'm wasting my academic potential, I have nothing good about myself except my mediocre grades, I'm stupid for being afraid of applying for things and ended up wasting a lot of opportunities that way"

I've gotten into NYU's College of Arts and Sciences for CS + Math and both RPI/Rutgers for CS. NYU would cost me $320k (full tuition) whereas both RPI and Rutgers would be $150-160k. I'm fortunate that I can afford either, so cost is not a huge concern, but I am factoring it in my decision because NYU is about 2x as much the other two. I live relatively close to both schools, so location and travel aren't concerns at all. 

Anyone here have any input as to where to go? I'm interested in either software engineering and TCS/ML research (as of now––this could change drastically during college). How are internship, research, networking etc. opportunities at these places? Thanks in advance!"

One of his principles is reciprocity. It is the most powerful principle I know for landing a job.

And yet no one seems to use it.

## Reciprocity

Reciprocity is the principle that if I give you something, you’ll want to do something for me.

Ever wonder why sales people like to send you free stuff? This is why.

The average person will email their resume and attach a generic message like:

*Hey, this is my resume - please give me a job.*

Instead, use the power of reciprocity to offer value first. This could mean offering a feature idea or finding a bug. Maybe even using some of their public datasets to crunch some numbers.

I did this in 2017 when I was looking for my first ever internship by emailing the CEO and attaching a slide deck on how I’d expand into one of their competitor verticals.

This is the reply I got from the startup CEO:

Here are 3 quick examples:

1. AngelList
2. TikTok
3. Coinbase

## AngelList

I have a personal example for this one :)

AngelList had a competitive new grad program.

I knew that if I simply applied through the regular job portal, I would never get an interview.

I created a keynote presentation outlining steps I would take to improve one of AngellList’s verticals (in this case, it was their job vertical).

I sent an email to the hiring manager with this presentation attached. 30min later, I had an interview scheduled.

## TikTok

TikTok is working pretty heavily on creator monetization. I noticed this because of all the job postings they have that reference this, like [this one](https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+product+manager&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCH565CH565&amp;oq=tiktok+product+m&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i512j0i457i512j0i512l6j69i57j0i512.3257j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ibp=htl;jobs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi775nv0tD2AhVcJDQIHYYTBIwQkd0GegQIHBAB#fpstate=tldetail&amp;htivrt=jobs&amp;htiq=tiktok+product+manager&amp;htidocid=CZXQ9dt-5uQAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtPVJezj1XxvvPR2WN6-ujOBDkl-A:1647640419144).

If I was applying to TikTok, I would write 2 pages on how Facebook and Youtube tackled this and how TikTok can execute it better.

I’d do my research through TechCrunch articles [like this](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/tiktok-adds-creator-monetization-features-including-tips-and-video-gifts/).

And then I’d cold email their [head of creator monetization](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustingoot/).

## Coinbase

Let’s assume I wanted a Product role at Coinbase. I’d use their app, go on Reddit and Twitter to find pain points, spend maybe an hour looking at their competitors, and then I’d come up with a feature idea.

I would then create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) to flesh up the feature idea.

Here’s an example.

I typed the query “coinbase improve” into Twitter search.

Found [this thread](https://twitter.com/treyedwards919/status/1454872763156545542):

https://preview.redd.it/m5zxfszhqxq81.png?width=1845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=962aeaa462a6ecaf64e6656be80a6b5974de065b

Read the replies, picked one I liked:

https://preview.redd.it/x1wbi9vjqxq81.png?width=1881&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a24cf5b0a0de756de6ab9e1fc16f8a54be673d99

And started drafting a PRD:

https://preview.redd.it/ziynxnamqxq81.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b9c8543306656dde82796e1fbffa80505115869

I would email this to [Max Brangburg, Coinbase’s VP of Product](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbranzburg/).

If you wanted to even go a step further, you could record a 90 second Loom video explaining your doc, and include it in the cold email you sent to a VP of Product.

\*\*\*

So do any of these things. And *then* send your resume.

It will go straight to the top of the pile.

Any questions and I'll be in the comments :)

tttmah,1,2022-04-01,I feel completely stuck,WoodpeckerNo1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tttmah/i_feel_completely_stuck/,"So here's a TL;DR of the situation:

In 2019 I finished my most recent education, then I just ended up being home all day with no plans or anything for most of the year. In august 2019 I had a panic attack randomly and have had derealization since (I constantly feel foggy 24/7 ever since then, constantly forget things, have a hard time concentrating, etc). In the meanwhile I've finished an internship as an attempt at finding work, but that ended up not working out (I didn't manage to learn all I need in time, I blame my derealization for hurting my performance and concentration). So, I took a second internship at another company, but a few weeks ago my father died and I've been home again since (I put my internship on hiatus about a week before he died). I'll resume it in 3 weeks, but everything combined.. I just feel completely stuck.

Like, these are the problems I have:

* I have zero friends (this has been since I finished high school). Basically my only social contacts are my cousin (who's far away from me most of the time, since he's studying at an university so I mainly just talk with him online in the weekends) and my mom, and sometimes I see family but not often. I'd love to have friends again, but I have horrible social anxiety and am extremely lazy,

* I have this weird extreme OCD-ish problem where I feel dirty at the slightest interaction with the outdoors (like if I go to a supermarket, take a walk outside, visit someone else at their house, go to my internship, etc, I feel a bad urge to take a shower once I'm home), which tends to keep me indoors even more combined with my social anxiety, despite that I'd otherwise would like to be more healthy in the sense that I'd like to take walks on a regular basis, but this weird problem just almost always keeps me inside since I find taking showers exhausting. Also makes finding friends even harder since this also often means having to go outside.

* Derealization just makes everything really weird and uncomfortable, and the fact that it's present 24/7 is horrible.

* Because I'm indoors nearly always, I tend to have a very narrow range of options for spending my time and as a result I tend to overplay music a lot (I deduce it to an unconscious attempt at passing time and filling the silence), which also has completely destroyed music for me (though this has been going on since 2017 at least) since I've turned it into a compulsive habit, basically a chore. Massive shame, since music is normally one of my biggest passions.

* Because my father died my mom and I lost our benefit and she's completely in charge of everything financial now (paying mortgage, insurance, etc, stuff like that) which she has no overview on at all (it drives her up the wall, my dad said it would be okay and that he'll sort things out but he died far sooner than we expected so we have no idea what to do at all), and of course just that he's gone to begin with is horrible. It's looking likely that we'll have to sell our house as well, but she absolutely doesn't want to do that (I don't want to either, but she's far more against the idea than I am), and on top of that it looks like we'll both have to find work to keep a stable income, but I'm still following an internship with no idea of when I actually will get the job and she's absolutely not suited for working (she's practically almost always tired, stressed out and can't deal with more things than we already to, but she's not quite impaired or anything so she can't be disqualified for work and get a benefit for that).

Honestly, I feel completely aimless and like everything is crumbling down."

ttu7s1,2,2022-04-01,What is the best job I can get to get my foot in the door?,MargotWonderland,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ttu7s1/what_is_the_best_job_i_can_get_to_get_my_foot_in/,"Hello, everyone!

Need job to get experience, need experience to get a job.

Long story short, for about 3 years I have been trying to transition into tech.

I started learning HTML and CSS as self taught, then I transitioned into JS and at this point I felt it would be faster if I did a bootcamp, so I did.

I finished the bootcamp and I sent more than 1000 resumes, I got about 10 interviews with HR and about technical interviews. Most of the time the feedback was that it's not that my solution was wrong, it was that someone else's was better. Several times people said they saw my passion and they thought I had great potencial but they were looking for someone more experienced, although they knew I had recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and had no work experience.

Since I didn't get a job, I decided to take a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I am in my second semester and I have no words to describe the frustration I feel because I am bored out of my mind on my current job (not IT related) and since I am studying part time, it will still take me a long time to be able to finish my degree. All the job ads I find ask for a bachelor's degree or experience and whenever I apply, most of the times I don't even have a reply or I get an automated message saying they decided to pursue other candidates.

I am super depressed and right now I pretty much can't believe I would ever find a job in IT, at least before I finished my bachelor's degree. All the student jobs ask for someone that knows a bit about sysadmin and networks, which I don't know at all because I haven't gotten that far in my education.

Even for internships they ask for someone with at least a bachelor's degree (most of them ask for a master's).

I was able to get a volunteer job as frontend developer but I wil only start working this month so this will only show relevant experience in at least a year.

So my question is: Is there anything I can do to at least find something remotely close to IT?

I have been thinking for a while to take this course [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) or the same from google for ux design, since I already know some web development.

What do you think? Would I be able to get a starter job with one of these courses?

PS: I don't know if this is relevant but I have 15 year's experience working in the health field, which they tld me in the bootcamp would be really good as these can be seen as transferable skills but nobody ever seemed to care about this and I live in Berlin, Germany but I don't speak fluent German.

Thanks to anyone who helps me."

Maths teacher - Initially wanted one from my econ teacher but my counsellor decided to get a rec from my maths teacher. Probably a better choice though.

Physics teacher - Worked with him to found a physics club and I was probably the best physicists in my class. Wasn't very close though. Probably around 7/10.

Counselor Rec - I once almost fought with him because we had some opinion clashes. I wanted to be in control of my rec etc but he didn't allow me. Great guy though, and told me that the fights made him like me as it showed that I was devoted to getting in. He knew quite well about me. Probably around 8/9-10.,

**Additional Information:**  
I think the fact that my ECs were not very strong and I had no special talents made me a weak applicant. An Asian boy in STEM is also not very unique in terms of profile. Not very happy, but honestly I aimed for just one acceptance, so I think it was a success overall!"

But I’m having such a bad experience that I cry everyday while doing work, even during meetings and after work. I’ll go through this with a timeline I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Just started:

\- Super excited to intern at this place, gonna be damn good for my resume, I know it’s definitely going to be more intense than my past internships because it’s a competitive internship program so i already had this expectation already. Got ready to work really really hard and make a good impression.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks in:

\- Manager tells me to take over and lead projects. Was abit shocked to hear that when I literally just started and expected to be more of a supporting role (literally as an intern) but I said okay, I’ll try my best to learn as fast as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

1 month in:

\- Understood the technical aspects of the job scope but still lost on processes because every project / every day there are different situations, and I don’t exactly know how to tackle them. Got overwhelmed quickly because I had the expectation of leading projects and I was trying to get used to everything ASAP. Started to feel really shitty about myself during meetings because I always couldn’t answer my manager’s questions. E.g., manager starts rambling during team meeting about a project that was ongoing even before I joined so I’m listening and trying to understand everything and then she asks me “so do you know what to do for this?” and obviously I don’t know so I stay silent or give a really unconfident answer because I really don’t know what… then I feel like my manager gets impatient with me or annoyed that I don’t know what to do and it’s like I’m expected to know. Of course I ask for clarification and she explains it but I still feel always shit about myself for not being able to answer her when to her it may seem like a damn simple question. Sometimes misunderstanding also happens because e.g., she asks me to ask for an update from a colleague because she’s not responding to emails that are requesting for some stuff, so I thought this was pretty straightforward without need for me to clarify with her, just message the colleague and ask her to send the stuff right? But no, it was a whole other story and she had a whole different meaning to “can you get an update from her”. reaaallly vague but yep.. just felt like she could have just told me straight what her intentions were.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months in (now):

\- Still lost about everything. I started to feel like a lot of it is on me because I’m learning too slow for the team I’m in. Felt like I’m not progressing at all and I felt bad for not making a contribution as an intern. Requested to talk to my manager, and I told her how I felt and the challenges I’m facing. I told her I need clearer instructions cuz as someone new to the team sometimes I may be misunderstanding the context etc. She says “I can give you instructions, but that’s not the way to learn”. I kind of know where she’s coming from, letting an intern think of how to do things on their own but perhaps it’s just a mismatch of working styles. I prefer structure and clarity while to be frank this team just feels extremely chaotic to me, not to mention the information is really messy and incomplete making it really hard for me to do my work. Told her i was thinking of ending the internship early but she discourage me from doing so saying its not that she dont have enough manpower but it would look bad on my resume. lol

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like I’m thinking too much because she seems nice when she talks but she also has a sarcastic/fake tone to it? Her laugh sounds fake, her niceness seems fake, and when I can’t do what she wants me to do I can immediately sense her impatience. She always asks really indirect questions but sometimes I feel like it’s on purpose to make me stumped and embarrass me. Same thing happens every single meeting. I’d rather she gets straight to the point and tell me, “do this and now you know you can do it like this to find this” if this makes sense. Also, everything that I know was taught to me by another intern who extended their contract. The intern is leaving soon so I will be doubly screwed when I’m alone. Everyone else in the company is so nice but I don’t know if I can continue working with my manager.. my mental health is at rock bottom right now and I’ve never ever felt this low in my life, feeling shit about my abilities, feeling shit about myself as a whole. Probably from another person's perspective I could just drag on and on stick it out and do really subpar until I finish my internship but I really am struggling damn badly to detach myself from wanting to do well and i hate that im always being talked down to. and i have a constant headache from crying everyday lol

&amp;#x200B;

so should i quit my internship, or is my manager maybe not as bad as i described, or am i a weakling who cannot tahan 3 months more and i should just stick it out?"

I hope you are doing well! So currently as a high school senior planning to pursue a career in the tech field, have narrowed my choices for college down to UC
Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington's CS program as a Direct Admit (my in-state school). 

Many people advised me previously to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents and Chancellor's Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead.

I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For
example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that
experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? Overall, if cost isn't a factor,

I hope you are doing well! So currently as a high school senior planning to pursue a career in the tech field, have narrowed my choices for college down to UC
Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington's CS program as a Direct Admit (my in- state school).

Many people advised me previously to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents
and Chancellor's Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding
which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual
Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my
degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and
that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For
example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that
experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? Overall, if cost isn't a factor,
what would make YOU choose one over the other? I am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!"

I will list their differences below:

1️⃣ Tuition: Brown needs 77904 dollars for 4 semesters while Gatech only needs 39741 dollars for 3semesters

2️⃣ Title: Brown is ivy while Gatech is top10 in us news cs rankings

3️⃣ Brown is a comprehensive private university, while Gatech is public and concentrate in cs

4️⃣ Both enjoy small class size 

5️⃣ Brown is pure CS program while Gatech is actually CSE, the core courses of which is largely related to mathematics. Maybe it will also influence in job application.

6️⃣ Gatech enjoys Co-op so that we can do internships within semesters. Brown is a 2-year program so offers an additional chance for H1B.

My goal is to find software engineer job. 

My undergraduate univ is kinda tech university, and I really dream for studying in a comprehensive university like Brown. Besides, Brown offers opportunities to study in Harvard and have a balanced workload. I can thus prepare for finding a job instead of doing school tasks all the time. 

But the tuition difference is as much as TWICE or even more. Does my obsession for a relaxed study style deserves such a big amount of money?

Thanks so much for your advice!

Recently I've been feeling like changing jobs since I no longer feel passionate about what I'm doing.

I always mention when I started working in the area (my early 20s), but lately I don't feel very proud about where I stand, in terms of what I know to do so.

I have 10 years but I could barely be a fit for an intermediate engineering job.

I've been considering the following options: change of career, keep working on IT but different field (I've transitioned from web dev, full stack, to only backend), intense studying and preparation for an interview, go back to school? (maybe too late, I'm 30)

ttxoc3,1175,2022-04-01,Thank you everyone. I did it.,Mississippimann,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ttxoc3/thank_you_everyone_i_did_it/,"I am 25 and have a bachelor degree in management, living in a country that I don’t speak the native language of due to my wife’s work. I’ve graduated a little more than a year ago and made +300 job applications in 5 months following my graduation, to no avail. I didn’t even land a single interview even though I crafted a cover letter for every individual company. My applications were for positions like project manager, customer success, accounting, marketing, analyst, and a lot of internship and graduate programs, nothing panned out. I’m still baffled by this. It’s a country with very competitive labor market and my CV didn’t stand out AT ALL. Since I didn’t have any significant achievements, locals who spoke the native language were always a step ahead although I always picked English speaking international companies to send my CV. 

The reason for my impulsive applications and panic was because I was going to be father in mid June (2021) and we needed one more income in our household. We were barely making ends meet with all the expenses even though my wife is earning higher than average. It was enough for two of us to survive, not for three. The day that our son was born, I made the decision to learn programming. It was always an option since I knew it was in demand, but rather frightening one since I had zero knowledge about it. I’ve read overwhelming amount of success stories in this subreddit the following days, some of which are still saved in my account to this day. 

We got some personal loans to tide us over until I find a job and my wife applied for parental leave, which is paid and one year long in our country. The plan was that she would look after the baby and I would invest all my time in studying.

I studied day and night from mid June to early January, should be averaging 14 hours a day and this is my humble guess. 1-2 days off in a month, to be able to spend time with my son. Cycles of tutorials and small projects with relevant technologies, again and again. I smacked my keyboard a lot, broke two of my glasses with the stress through the roof. Probably lost a lot hair during this period.

 From early January to March I was building fully fledged, solid projects to show in my portfolio. This was at a moderate speed, averaging 6-7 hours of work a day, and was a much more pleasant period since I’ve grown some confidence in my tech stack and didn’t need tutorials. All I needed was original ideas. During this period I also got to meet my son, which I couldn’t spend much time past 6 months.

I started making new job applications at March with my portfolio, for software developer positions this time. It was emotionally challenging given my traumas from past year. 

I’ve had multiple rounds of interviews at 4 different companies throughout march. I’ve passed all technical interviews and got 3 offers, one of which I accepted today and I will sign the contract next week! Since I had several offers, some companies had to make counter offers and I ended up getting 20% more than regular junior salary in the country. Mind blowing!

I will have the best sleep of my life this weekend. This subreddit has been a great guidance and motivation to me, thank you everyone! 

Hope this post can motivate some of you that are on the same path! Don’t give up, I promise every minute of your work will pay off.

Edit: I will make sure to answer the questions on this thread tomorrow. Thanks everyone for all your good wishes and the award!"
ttym5f,8,2022-04-01,CMU vs UT Austin,Ok_Team7122,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ttym5f/cmu_vs_ut_austin/," I have been accepted to the CMU MCDS program and the UT Austin MSCS (Specialization in Machine Learning) program.

CMU MCDS costs me close to 120k (tuition and living) USD while UT Austin after a teaching assistantship tuition aid (which almost everyone gets) costs me 10k USD (tuition and living). Both are 1.5 year long programs.

My end goal is an excellent career outcome: I am interested in working in data science roles in the industry. Getting ML/Data Science roles (Applied Scientist, Research Scientist, etc.) is easy from CMU but not totally impossible for UT Austin. Currently I have 10 months internship experience in ML from India, and a couple of ML-based research papers in top/medium venues.

Are ML jobs really dependent on the university tag? Is it worth spending the extra 110k?

Also, how easy is it to get ML roles in the industry without experience?"

tu0bhw,6,2022-04-01,How to Grow Your Business on a Shoe-String Budget,BonjoroBear,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/tu0bhw/how_to_grow_your_business_on_a_shoestring_budget/,"When I consult I often get asked what the most effective use of a small marketing budget is, where to start with growth experimentation and how to know when to pivot.   
   
First, for budget, if I had only &lt; $5k/month I wouldn’t be running paid advertising (or sponsorships). I would be pumping that into creative and personnel. Hire some interns for 10 hours a week. Hire freelancers on Behance or Upwork to design some beautiful assets you can promote your content through. Invest in a slick homepage.  
   
In terms of growth and marketing swings, I would start with building your “cornerstone content”.   
   
This means, what in the market do you understand that other people are missing? Be a champion of that issue. Then take that and start talking about it publicly on podcasts in your niche. Start hopping on guest webinars.   
   
This was a game changer for us at Bonjoro. We talked about how video is the future, but it has to be scaleable (and this message tied back to our product which is built to integrate with people’s CRMs or ESPs). We also talked about CLTV and the importance of the relationship, which is being lost in a sea of automation. Find that topic where you can put your flag in the hill.   


Think about growth swings that have multiple benefit paths (meaning if this podcast doesn't generate me traffic, does it still have value as a way to build industry partnerships? What about host relationships? Be a part of an ABM motion?). In fact, having done nearly 300 podcasts since 2020, over 100 of those hosts actually started using our product!  


In terms of content strategy...  
   
Start on say Linkedin, but republish your content to Reddit, Medium, Twitter, DemandCurve and whatever other niche communities your ICP congregates. Once you start to get some momentum with thought leadership on the problem, start moving downstream to the tactical use case stuff. Have detailed use cases that are simple to skim (Three sections, What was the problem? How did they tackle it? What are the results?). Gather customer testimonials and feedback (preferably video) and use that to substantiate your claims.   
   
In growth marketing, I like to break things down into “Maintenance” and “Viral” swings. Maintenance swings are all the things you need to do. Case studies, JTBD articles, Tips, and industry best practices, and SEO-friendly content. It’s important, but it isn’t a step change. To get a million eyes on something you need to also take viral swings. Like last year when we made a short film with our friends over at DesignPickle in a partner collab. Each quarter I recommend 2-3 viral swings to go along with your dozens of maintenance swings.

If you have a small marketing budget you need to constantly be thinking about amplification. What other brands and communities have the customers I want to be targeting? How can I partner with them in a way that leads with value for THEM? Partnerships I think are vital to early-stage growth (especially in B2B)."

Counselor: I'm not sure what she submitted, but I have a decent relationship with my counselor.

**Interviews**

Harvard: 9/10. Lasted more than an hour and she was very friendly! I was nervous and stumbled over my words in the beginning, but I was able to truly express my background and personality + future plans over the summer.

Yale: 6/10. A little awkward because I conducted it during school and had multiple interruptions due to the PA system here.

MIT: NA/10. Interviewer never responded to my follow up email and messages, so I never got the chance to interview with her.

**Essays**

When I tell you that I rushed all of my essays, ***I rushed all of my essays***. Having different responsibilities around the house and school, I could barely find time to write my essays for all of the programs and universities I applied to. My Harvard essay was written hours before the deadline during New Year's Eve and my QuestBridge application was written a few days before.

Personal Statement: 6/10. Personally unhappy with the final result. Some of my peers liked it, but my college advisor felt that it didn't represent me (as in the things that I've done and accomplished). It discussed my unconventional experiences growing up in a liquor store and how I handled being ostracized by the community around me.

Supplements (QuestBridge): 8/10 A lot were rushed, but focused on community-based activities. My short answers were ""quirky"" and I made lots of jokes!

Why Major Essay: 9/10. This essay was the one I really liked because I focused on my connection with my community and how I will use my CS degree to make a direct impact one person at a time.

**Additional Information:**

On a key note, I was really surprised that I got into an Ivy League University considering the general reaction to my personal essay. I honestly have no clue how I got into Harvard with it's shocking 3% acceptance rate this year, but I'm extremely happy that I did!

I feel like I was genuine with both my activities and essays. Although I did participate in the usual clubs (Honor Societies, Academic Clubs, etc.), I didn't list them anywhere in my application. I focused on making small but direct impacts on the students in my community, who typically don't receive extra tutoring or experience in STEM. My additional information section discussed my family responsibilities and more about the context of my low-income situation.

Going back to my background, my high school is in a low-income, minority area where not many people pursue a higher education at all. Our average SAT score is \~900 (being dead serious) and I didn't have access to a paid tutor. Luckily, I have a dad who was adamant about training me in the SAT Math section, but I had no help with the English section. My school had a student last year attend Wellesley, two students attending Rice three years ago, and a few students 10 years ago get into Stanford and MIT. I tried to make the best of my situation while balancing my familial responsibilities.

**\*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\*\***: Lately, I've been receiving messages regarding requests for advice in getting accepted into an Ivy League. I am not trying to be rude or gatekeep information, but I believe that I am unqualified to provide assistance in that process. As a high school senior who received little information and professional assistance with my application, I don't know how the admission process works, nor do I know what combination of ECs/Stats/Essays will guarantee an acceptance. There are lots of resources online that can help you with that information, but again I am unqualified in this area of expertise."

Hello guys, so recently I got a research intern position at a university under prof. (I wanted to work with him for ages).

So after talking to him, I realized, I am mainly supposed to code TMS 320 series microprocessor for GaN based power electronics gate drivers and design PCBs. However, I have not taken any senior digital electronics classes or even a basic course in microprocessors and controllers; I had taken digital logic in the first year and I have forgotten everything. Later, I talked to Ph.D. scholar who would be working with the prof and me, he said it'll be to catch if you know basic programming.

So, my question basically is:- can one learn to code TMS 320 series microcontroller without any background in digital electronics, if not where should I start and how should I go about it? And in general, how should I learn to code TMS 320 series microcontroller from scratch?

Thanks."

Research professor – definitely a glowing letter of recommendation, talked about how I was a natural researcher, compared me to graduate students he has worked with. (9/10)

AP Chemistry teacher (11th grade) – mentioned that I was the greatest chemistry student she has taught in her twenty-five years of teaching the class, was also my Debate and Science Olympiad coach so she mentioned that too. (10/10)

AP Lit teacher (11th grade) – talked about how I was far ahead of other students in English, my natural curiosity and ability to dive deep into ideas. (10/10)

**Interviews**

There were a lot, so I’m just go to rate them and I’ll explain only a few important ones:

Columbia - (7/10)

Harvard - (10/10) – One of the greatest conversations I have ever head with a person; my interviewer truly loved me and said that they would make the most compelling possible case for me as an applicant.

Yale - (10/10)

MIT - (8/10)

UPenn - (6/10)

Princeton - (9/10)

Cornell - (4/10) - She had to reschedule it twice, and she didn’t seem to like interviewing very much. However, we did start to connect in the last ten minutes, so it wasn’t terrible.

**Essays**

Personal Statement (9/10) – I hate giving it such a high rating, but I had 2 AO’s from T20s read it and several admitted Ivy students. Their reactions were extremely positive, calling it touching and poignant. It was about a deeply personal experience that led me to love physics.

Supplements (10/10) – Same reaction as above.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

***Acceptances:***

* State school

***Waitlists:***

* Northeastern EA
* UMich EA
* Syracuse

***Rejections:***

* MIT RD
* Harvard RD
* Princeton RD
* Columbia RD
* Cornell ED (rejected right away)
* Yale RD
* UPenn RD
* Emory RD
* Vanderbilt
* Boston University
* All the UC’s
* Colgate RD
* Skidmore RD

**Advice/Reflections:**

Let’s just say, I am crushed by these outcomes. I thought my EC’s were strong, and since 2 literal AO’s from T20s said my essay was among the best they had ever read, I guess I expected a little more. Being rejected by Colgate, Skidmore, and BU hurt a lot, and I’ve gone back and have spent hours trying to figure out what went wrong. You would think it was my essays, that they were bland, but that’s just not true, no matter how many times I try to tell myself that this is the reason.

I’ll be happy and fine at my state school, and I will move on. Honestly, for future applicants, I think we need to stop idealizing the top 20, even the top 50, schools in the USA. I think we have reached a major problem in the college apps process, and I’m honestly ready to forget about it all and be happy at my state school, where I can at least keep some of the friends I made in HS.

Anyway, good luck to everyone! Class of 27 applicants: honestly, please just boycott the T30 schools."

I'm an international student here at the CoE studying CS, and I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with / tips for applying for internships as a student on an F-1.

First of all, I am lucky enough to be currently working with ITS, and I really do feel fortunate that I have this position.

However, I have also applied to \~60 positions for summer internships to get some experience in applying to jobs / creating a resume / going through the whole process and searching if there were any opportunities that would be a good fit for me over summer, and I have heard nothing back from anyone. No interviews, and almost no online assessments other than the applications who automatically send them to anyone who applies.

I have gone to the ECRC to get a second look at my resume, and they said it all looked good and to just keep applying, but it really is discouraging to apply to so many places and hear radio silence. It's not there is a lot of information they get from me once I apply; it's literally just a resume and a cover letter, and that doesn't leave a lot of room to improve.

I don't know whether to chalk it up to being on a Visa or something else. I am finishing up with EECS 281 and 376 right now, and it's really been disappointing to work so hard on filling out \*\*so\*\* many forms just to hear no response back.

I know that for someone who wants to learn computer vision, it doesn't matter what kind of info they are feeding to the model, what matter is the algorithm. But are there any other tricks that I am not aware of? Should I straight look for robotics companies or should I go for Nvidia? Going for any robotics company will get me relocated but I can stay in my city if I go with Nvidia, so that's a huge plus for me. I am sure that I will learn a ton there but I would like to get your opinion on this. Thank you."
tu3ecc,2,2022-04-01,Is it okay to reach out to a bunch of recruiters in the same company?,ThrowRA_cranberry2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tu3ecc/is_it_okay_to_reach_out_to_a_bunch_of_recruiters/,"So I have been interviewing at a large company (not faang) and I'm a bit lost. I applied for an Embedded Systems Software Engineer Intern position and was asked to interview like the same day I applied. The interviewer ended up having to move my interview 2 days after the original date. Unfortunately, before that day came I got an email saying the position has been filled so my interview got cancelled. 

Then the next day, my friend who works there currently emailed a recruiter that he knows a recommendation for me and asked if there are any open roles (specifically on the automotive section, but I was open to any). The recruiter said she would pass it to the hiring manager in the Automotive section because there is 1 position left. Then, I got called for another interview like right away. I didn't really know what the role was because I couldn't view an application for it on the portal, but it was a software engineering position for a specific team in the Automotive section. The job title was kind of specific to the project they were working on (not a general application like the embedded systems one). Anyways, I did not really know what to expect but prepared pretty well since I had been studying for the embedded systems interview anyways. 

I interviewed with 2 people on the team (2 different interviews) and they were both pretty difficult. They did not care about any behavioral stuff at all, and went straight into asking me difficult software engineering conceptual questions. That kinda caught me off guard, and I didn't know a few of the questions. I had trouble explaining some concepts because I barely knew stuff about it. I felt really dumb. Then there was 1 programming question which was medium difficulty, but I didn't finish that one either. For the second interview, the guy was a little bit nicer, but still not very friendly. He did not seem very excited to talk to me and kind of had a stern look on his face. I was able to answer more of his questions this time, but a few I was unsure of. (Less than the 1st one though). Then there was a programming question which was pretty easy and did correctly. But for some reason, this interviewer just did not seem to like me. Even though I think I performed somewhat well, I still felt kind of dumb. Maybe because of the dry way he was talking to me, idk. Anyways I asked a couple good questions and the interview ended. He didn't really say anything like in regards to following up or next steps.

I have a pretty good feeling I won't be selected. I am not too hurt by this because this specific role seemed very specialized. Like maybe it was meant for a masters or PhD student intern. I dont know. But either way, I feel like I kind of got the short end of the stick with this company because I was assigned to interview with that role and not the original general one. 

I reached out to my recruiter from last year (I had a positive experience with that team and the interviewers) and asked if she was aware of any openings in that sector (this company has a lot of subsidiaries). She replied right away and said she would hand my resume off to the right people and keep me posted. 

I was thinking about emailing the 3 other recruiters that contacted me for the first role and then the automotive one, and ask if they are aware of any other open roles, but I feel like maybe I'm being too desperate? Like, is it bad to say I am open to other roles in the company? I feel like its not because the company is so big. I get contacted by recruiters every year for this company and each time I have applied, I got an interview pretty quickly. The difficulty of the interviews are generally not too bad. I have a few friends who work there and they've said it isn't difficult. I also interviewed with them last year and the 2 interviews I had were pretty easy. I didn't get picked last year but I feel like I performed really well and the interviewers told me to try again next year. 

So, what should I do? Should I email the other 3 recruiters I know and ask about any open roles? Or, should I just wait on the one who said she'd hand my resume to the right people? Or am I seeming too desperate and stop contacting all of them altogether?

PS. I know many of you would advise me to apply to other places. I have interviews with other places already but am still very interested in this company.


TLDR: I interviewed for a specific team within a large company. I felt like it was way too hard/not a good fit for me and would rather interview for the general intern pool. Would it be okay to contact all 4 of my recruiters asking to see if there are any other open roles? Or does that just seem really desperate?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

I feel that this was the worst part of my application, I’ve always had a really hard time making connections with teachers and it’s something I want to work on. This also wasn’t helped by the fact that the teachers I wanted to ask left the school and I only got to know these teachers minimally through virtual Zoom school.

11th Grade Language Arts Teacher (5/10) - I think she liked me well enough but I wasn’t really a outstanding student and we didn’t ever have very engaging conversations.

BC Calc Teacher (3/10) - I didn’t participate in class much and he always complained about writing rec letters. We also never really had any conversations either. (I didn’t have any other STEM teacher I could have asked because they all left the school and I couldn’t reach them)

**Interviews**

MIT (5/10) - Had a tech issue that made me join late. Conversation felt really forced and didn’t go smoothly because I didn’t have enough questions to ask her and she barely had any for me. 

Northwestern (6/10) - Interviewer barely asked me any questions and just talked about the school the whole time.

Princeton (1/10) - She ended it after 15 minutes which actually shocked me because I thought it was going well.

**Essays**

I feel that my common app essay was the best part of my application. It was the story of how I joined the political activism organization out of a drive to do more, and ended up inspiring my friends and community to do the same to become more involved in the state of our futures. I think it really showed my personality and it described how I want to weave together electrical engineering and policy to work in the renewable energy sector to help solve climate change.

**Additional Information:**

*College application season was nothing short of stressful for me.

I’ve also always known since I was in 6th grade that I would be going to Georgia Tech, so I guess I got exactly what I expected. It just hurts because it now feels like I don’t have any other options when I wanted it to be because I chose GT myself over other colleges knowing for sure it’s the right place for me.*

Very conflicted where I should attend. Lmk in the comments. I want to do comp sci so I would have to transfer or double major across schools if I were to go to UPenn. Brown/Cornell is more open.

Final adivce

1. Apply to lots of schools. You never know where you are going to get in/get rejected these days.
2. Put all your efforts into 3 or 4 ECs and branch out from there.
3. Essays are extremely important. More so than awards. People from my school with similar awards to me from my school got no ivies."
tu5x2q,5,2022-04-01,Research intern at Microsoft cloud and AI Vs Amazon applied scientist intern,Nin_kat,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tu5x2q/research_intern_at_microsoft_cloud_and_ai_vs/,"I am an international student currently pursuing my master's (CS) in the USA. I have been fortunate enough to get an offer from both Microsoft and Amazon for summer research internships. I need help in deciding between the two. 

Amazon: (position: Applied Scientist Intern)

Pros:

1. All applied scientist interns get full-time offers based on assessment.
2. Pay is better (as compared to SDE), 

Cons:

1. The team that I would be working for is okayish in terms of the project. 
2. WLB can be off. 

Microsoft: (position: Research intern)

Pros: 

1. More prestigious in terms of research. 
2. The team has an exciting project.
3. Good WLB. 

Cons: 

1. No full-time offer is guaranteed (people in the team can make recommendations, have to go through the employment cycle again but chances are good). 
2. Not sure about pay, can be the same as SDE.

While I am leaning towards Microsoft, my only concern is w.r.t the return offer. Since the employment cycle can get quite tiring, I would want to have some assurance. Looking forward to suggestions."

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. **Math Club:** I am the president of the math team at my school and have been the leading competitor for the past few years. I received awards in the top five for a national convention (cannot name due to privacy) in analytical geometry, probability/combinatorics, and physics. I have various other state/regional awards.
2. **Intern at Research Institute:** I was an intern at a local research institute. I shadowed and worked with lab technicians and researchers in biomedical techniques such as CAR T-cell immunotherapy, insulin production via genetic engineering, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. I attended daily lectures on topics like public health, immunology, and biochemistry.
3. **Chemistry/Lab Assistant:** I am an assistant for my high school for my high school's science department. I was tasked with logistical jobs such as labeling lab equipment and organizing substances. I prepared in-class labs by calibrating balances and handling necessary chemicals. I also created answer keys for IB Chemistry assignments and homework.
4. **MOSTEC (MIT Online Science Technology and Engineering Community):** I was one of \~280 students participating in a nationwide summer program at MIT. My project was with applied math in molecular biology/virology. I utilized MatLab to create a support vector machine algorithm to classify and identify Influenza A strains from the 2009 Influenza pandemic based on their genetic sequences as well as created a neural network to predict hypothetical new strains/mutations. I also collaborated with medical professionals and journalism instructors to create a report on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Native American communities and the intersections between racial equity and public health. 
5. **Math Tutor:** I created weekly curricula covering topics tested on AMC, MATHCOUNTS, and Mu Alpha Theta contests for a non-profit. My lessons involved essential math skills spanning from basic algebra to advanced trigonometry. I was awarded ""volunteer of the month.""
6. **Computer Science (Hobby):** I created a short online Python notebook shared with my high school and community that covers the basics of programming with Python including conditionals, loops, dictionaries, and more in an attempt to introduce my peers who do not have access to these classes to coding. 
7. **Orchestra:** I was the concertmaster for my high school orchestra for three years and I was president last year. I directed various events and rehearsals.
8. **Violin:** I study violin at a local university and I performed in various solo/chamber recitals. I was the concertmaster for a local youth symphony and performed as a soloist in various concerto series. 
9. **Composition:** I am a professional composer in my area and I have been commissioned by various orchestras and chamber groups. I am the student of a composer who graduated from Northwestern and the Cleaveland Institute of Music. I am published by an international music company.
10. **Composing Workshop:** Unfortunately I cannot put the name of this program as it would make it very easy to identify me. I was part of a three-month program to compose for an internationally renowned symphony along with 9 other high school students. I wrote a new piece for Pierrot ensemble (Violin, Cello, Flute, Clarinet, Percussion, and Harp) and my piece was broadcasted in Oaxaca, Mexico, and across the US. I was interviewed by a radio station in my hometown in Oaxaca about my piece and there were a few articles about me :O

**Awards/Honors**

1. Collegeboard National Hispanic Recognition (Although I am Indigenous, the CB considers me to only be Latino since my parents are from Mexico)
2. Presidential Volunteer Service Award
3. Questbridge College Prep Scholar
4. Questbridge National College Match Finalist

**Letters of Recommendation**

History Teacher: 8/10 - This is a teacher that I've known since I was a freshman and she has constantly supported me throughout all of my high school career and since she is a classically trained singer, we are also really good friends outside of the classroom (she attended some of my premieres and I watched some of her recitals :DD).

Biology Teacher: 10/10 - I've also known her since I was a freshman and she has done so much for me and my family in and out of school. I can go on but basically, she helped my mom win her civil divorce/custody case and I think that says enough.

**Interviews**

MIT: 7/10 - It was a bit awkward in some parts but my interviewer was very kind and seemed genuinely interested in the work I've done while in high school. The interview lasted about an hour and a half and I got to learn a lot about the school from him. In an email afterwards, he said that he enjoyed interviewing many students and said it ""was a particular pleasure to meet with \[me\]""

Columbia (not for admissions, for the NOP program): 9/10 My interviewer was a current freshman so she was really shy but we came from a really similar background and had a lot of similar interests so I really enjoyed it. She related a lot to my experiences in high school and overall it was just a very enjoyable and comfortable interview.

Dartmouth: 10/10 - My interview was a black alumni and because of this we had a lot to talk about our identities and how we've been shaped by it in academia. It was my most enjoyable interview and I genuinely felt connected and felt like I had made a friend. She also said that she saw a lot of fire and passion in my eyes which was really sweet :')

Northwestern: 8/10 - This interview was mostly me talking rather than a back and forth conversation but it was really fun! My interviewer had a lot of valuable things to talk about and it was really light-hearted which made it comfortable. 

Stanford: 5/10 - This interview was SO HARD. She asked so many hard questions like how I would merge my identity as an indigenous person with my interests in STEM to serve my community and it was just really challenging. But I feel like I was able to convey who I am as a student and person well still. 

**Essays**

Because of questbridge and MOSTEC, I had a lot of practice writing essays and I genuinely feel like my essays were at their best and really showed who I truly am as a person. My personal statement for my common app was about my eyes and how when I was younger, I would be teased for them and it was a constant reminder of my people's erasure. But as I grew up, I took power in my eyes and recognized that my ancestors had passed them down to me and that it is my responsibility to show the beauty and power in my roots through music and composition. For my questbridge app, my main essay was about Mixtec spirituality. Instead of gods, we believe in the sun, the land, water, the moon, and the stars. I talked about how each of these spirits guided me in my life and how they rekindled my hope for a better life (cw: violence &gt;!my mother and I suffered from domestic abuse and are in a very poor financial state. we struggled a lot especially during the pandemic!&lt;) I truly loved this essay and after reading it I realized how much my roots have given me the power to continue going.

5. \#5 2nd place at the same competition but this time for Algebra 1 (State/Regional)

Also had AP scholar with distinction and some recognition at governor's school which I probably should have put in

**Letters of Recommendation**

I am extremely uncertain about these, I was not able to read them or talk to my teachers about them so I am basing this off what I think they would write and hindsight

Counselor: 6-7/10, wrote her letters crazy early with only a brag sheet to go on, she seemed to really like me though when I went to her office for help many times

Calculus teacher: 7-8/10 She really liked me, probably thought highly of me, super nice teacher who writes a lot of recs for kids

Biology teacher: 5-6/10: very nice teacher, liked me a lot, she seemed very unmotivated throughout the year and might have struggled with mental health issues, I kind of regret asking this teacher but my other option, the gov teacher was dealing with family losses

**Interviews**

All virtual this year, all went smoothly talking at least 15-30 minutes over the 45 minute template, made sure to ask some questions

Harvard: 5-7/10 went pretty well he seemed nice and seemed to like what I was saying but was really old and kept going off topic with stories, he was the only one to send me what looked like his report, said I was confident but wasn't set on my career path which apparently ""true geniuses"" are. He gave me a 2 in that category which I'm pretty sure could be worse

Yale: 6-8/10 First interview, was pretty nervous but was able to pull through, talked about my ECs and stuff, he was from my high school and said that he liked seeing Arkansas kids get in so maybe he left a good report

Princeton: 7-8/10 In my opinion the best interview, no nerves because I had just finished another one that morning, talked about ECs and experience in community service

Stanford: 7/10 honestly forgot most what we talked about, did have some time sharing our sports experiences

Dartmouth: 6/10: was a doctor working at a hospital in the town next to me, went smoothly except for a brief pause where I lost my train of thought and he kinda had to guide me along.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

I thought my essays were all pretty good but in hindsight maybe they weren't good enough. I definitely could've spent more time on them or had more people read them and I did procrastinate a little, especially for applying to 20 schools.

Personal Statement: wrote about growing up with a stutter and gradually making progress with it in high school by pursuing my passions and forming communities. This was probably my best essay and the most proofread one.

Supplementals: These for sure could have been proofread more but I tried to make them specific and unique to make my personality and activities that I did

**Additional Information:** Just somethings I've thought about:

Not gonna lie when Ivy day was over I was feeling pretty numb. Looking back I had no right to feel this way. I had been accepted into other nice schools and the Ivies are very hard to get into especially without hooks. My thinking was that my high school every year has had ivy acceptances- might even go as far to say there is a HYPSM every year who usually an Asian kid I know. I was friends with all of these kids who went on to the ivies and we would compare portfolios and stuff. I think my high school accomplishments were on par with most of them and I genuinely thought it was my time to follow in their footsteps. That didn't happen.

I've thought about why that was. Its very possible I could have phrased things better on CommonApp. Maybe I should've included different honors or ECs. Perhaps my essays needed more time or my rec letters were average. I've even thought about people taking gap years hurting my chances or having no hooks ruining me.

When I look online however, I see people who are much more accomplished than me without my results. These people deserved it more, but got the same result: it didn't work out. I guess I'm trying to emphasize to seniors who feel disappointed or the future applicants, like the thousands of other people who have emphasized this, -the process really is unpredictable and often times out of your control. Its probably not your fault if you're met with disappointment on the big day. Maybe you're like me and its a little bit your fault. Either way, Life will go on and no one will care where you went to school in a few years. 

What I will say to the future applicants is to get as much help as possible and look over your application trying to make it the best it can be, whether that be wording, EC choice, or revising your essays many times over. 

My parents, however harsh they could be at times, were supportive at the end. One thing that I keep thinking about is that a few years ago they said that I should work as hard as I possibly could these few years so I could relax where I am now either with results or the knowledge that I left it all out there. I'm not sure that I was able to do that. While I can't think of anything specific that I could have done differently, I know that I didn't manage my time all that well and was distracted often. I didn't really live up to what they said to do. That's probably the only real regret I have, not giving it all I had. I've apologized to my past self and my parents but there's nothing I can do now.

So future applicants please put all that you have into these applications. I'm not saying stay at home and study all day. Go hang out with friends, go to football games, prom, and concerts. But put the work in when it's time to work. Also don't expect too much so you won't be devastated if the worst happens, and you'll be ecstatic if you get your preferred results

TLDR: little disappointed, could've worked harder, but could've ended up a lot worse. If you're a future applicant be sure to grind it out during app season

All that out of the way, I am grateful to be attending a great university with a nice scholarship and who knows maybe waitlists will pull through"

tu78kx,9,2022-04-01,I don't know how much more I can take...,hobbesrevenge,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/tu78kx/i_dont_know_how_much_more_i_can_take/,"I have worked for a small Community center for about 8+ years now. I started their essentially by creating their social skills program (started with about 12 kids now we have about 40 enrolled), and then I was a counselor in a school through them (they are a contract agency at the local school district and provide counselors there at a lower cost). I did that on top of doing evening social skills groups for about 6 years, essentially working 55 hours a week most of the year. In that time our executive director of like 30 years (who was crazy as a loon but liked me for some reason) retired. A new old guy took over and he was sort of sneakily fired some 6 or 7 months into working there and his second-in-command took over. This new guy grew up in the agency and is the type of dude that always says the things you want to hear, is generally well-liked but idk something seems off lately. 

I am generally a lay-low type of person, I am fully licensed and since COVID have been considering starting my own practice (which I informed him of over the summer when negotiations were on the table). I never did because the organization I worked at always gave me a lot of freedoms in how I worked, they let me see individual clients on the side, let me manage the groups fully, and my work at the school was essentially my own. While the pay wasn't as much as I knew I could make in PP, the community of kids, and the freedoms I had around my programming were fun and motivating enough to make it worth it.

Since I had been there for awhile I was also taking on more things, essentially they wanted me to start up their group practice portion of things, which on top of everything else I was doing was anxiety-provoking and beyond that there were a lot of things I didn't agree with (such as the use of simple practice \[pricey and unnecessary in my opinion\], advertising in dumb ways \[not using psych today\], the list goes on and on). I voiced my disagreements on and off in Nov/Dec 21 and then Mid-December took a necessary and needed vacation for nearly 2 weeks...here is where things get weird. 

I come back early January and they hired an intake coordinator, no communication or follow-up with me about this decision (despite me supposedly being the lead on these things) and since then, nearly zero-communication. This person talks to the Exec. director and I am sort of there in the background. Of course, I was asked to transfer all my clients onto Simple Practice, which I did, reluctantly (the social skills program was never, in my opinion, meant to be a clinical program, more like a class, so I still am not comfortable with them on the platform). So here I am in this sort of limbo, not being heard or part of any meetings of any substance, I still lead my social skills program, work at a school, lead a mentoring program, have a lot to do but am not part of any major decisions. I feel deeply hurt by the whole thing and it seems to be a trend at the agency that when they no longer need you they create a new system and slowly extricate you rather then be up front about things.  

So now I have my next session of social skills starting and I have a feeling they want me to raise the rates (another thing I take huge issue with are the rates for counseling, as a community agency funded, in part, by the town and county, I believe we have an obligation to the community to keep rates fair, I believe this all the more so with our groups). Bottomline, I don't want to raise them nor do I want to tell parents that we ARE raising them. We just raised the rates (from $20-$25 per session) of my groups and I know that they want me to raise them to $40 per session. I feel like this is unethical to do 3/4s of the way through the school year and I also feel like I'll be betraying those kids/parents I provide services to. 

I want to leave this organization and have already signed a lease of a beautiful office space a mere 10 minute walk from my house (I live about a half hour drive from the org.), the problem is I am so deeply deeply entwined in so much of the programming there. I have interns, I see 40 kids for social skills groups, I work at a school. Anyways, I have invested so much into this organization and I don't know what to do ethically or otherwise moving forward. Thoughts and perspectives appreciated here."

tu7so4,2,2022-04-01,Why am I so tired and angry?,thewitchofcarmilla,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tu7so4/why_am_i_so_tired_and_angry/,"This will be quite a long post, but I have some steam to offload to a community that hopefully understands and shares my experience. I am currently in university and about to graduate. I have been applying for jobs back to back and the jobs that did call me back, told me that I was unfit for the role. Let me give you some background. 

I am currently a marketing student and I applied for a role as a Communications Analyst at a nice company in the City. I had the interview a few days ago, and they emailed me yesterday morning to inform me that while I was engaging and I knew my subject well and I was a great contender, they felt that I was better suited to marketing than communications because they wanted to hear me talk about other content outside of social media - which I would've done if the question was clear to me. When I read that sentence, I must admit I definitely wanted to cackle. Communications is an underlying body of marketing literature - literally the study of business-consumer communications, as well as other things of course (as marketing science is interdisciplinary). They are integrated for a reason, so reading that sentence made me feel as though they needed to find something they weren't comfortable with about me and that they wanted someone who fit the paper bill to the letter. I am tired because, I think somewhere deep inside, I was expecting this as I've been to engaging, fun interviews only to be told later ""Oh, your interview was great but we don't think you'd be good for xyz..."". I was genuinely shocked when I realised they decided I wasn't fit for the role because...I didn't answer ***one question*** to their liking. ***One***. Like, am I incapable of simply, learning an answer? They always say stuff like ""we like someone will willingness to learn"" or some shit then do this! I literally feel like I am in the twilight zone. 

I have taken so, so many courses, internships and employability classes and added to resume and cover, and actively worked on making myself more employable along with being predicted for a First. I really thought it was me, that maybe I had been doing something wrong. So I messaged my friend and asked her about how she got her role as a marketer in a global company, and she told me that she applied for hundreds over the course of a few weeks and only one responded - where the interviewer was aggressive (and admitted to me that she thought she'd bungled it) only to have him call her half an hour later to inform her she got the job. This story is similar to most people I've asked in my life. 

I am so exhausted, I literally don't know what to do next. The whole process of interviewing is where I fall, but it's about me and my personality and I feel like I have to put on a performance or Stanislavsky-level method acting to impress. There are people who are so extroverted, who know how to game the system and play up the character the hiring managers are looking for. I don't know if I'm wrong, but I get the feeling that many HR people want someone who fits the bill on paper and don't actually give a fuck about who the person is. How many people have HR managers turned away only to realise (or not) that they turned away someone who could've been amazing at the job? The role I applied for requires in depth knowledge of current affairs and politics - which I most certainly have and they knew that - that's the reason they responded to my application at first. I knew I would've loved the role and would've been excellent at it, but because I didn't answer one question for them how they'd wanted it - they turned me away. I have many stories like this one. As I get older, I realise that life isn't as simple as it was to me when I was a teenager. I had such a streamlined view of my way to a good post-graduate job, and now I am unsure and shaky. There was a recruitment person that turned me away because they said the examples of 4 characteristics they were looking for that I gave weren't as strong as others - and that was when I realised that the real test of this interviewing process is confidence. Confidence enough that if you were lying, they'd believe it. They get the role and are worse at it but someone they turned away with the skills to actually do the job because they're too anxious and stutter when they're put on the spot. I feel so resentful when I see people I know are less qualified than me get the role and makes me feel that recruitment don't actually care about picking the best candidates, they simply look for great talkers who answer all their questions in the way they've imagined in their heads and if they don't like your answer you're gone - as if people are incapable of learning. Maybe, that's some unconscious thing, maybe it is conscious - but regardless, no one can say with a straight face that recruitment like this is the best and most efficient way of picking people. Even when searching for job roles, you filter the search to entry-level roles ***specifically***, and you'll still get roles that say ""1-3 years of experience required/preferred"", like huh? I know I'm not fucking stupid, that is not an entry level role! I even had to google this and I read somewhere that they do this to increase the exposure of the listing. They want you to have 3 years of work experience under your belt just to empty bins of banana peels and microwaveable oatmeal and run coffee errands for senior team members. The recruitment process is already so dehumanising, having to perform for these strangers that examine you like a piece of cardboard, reducing you to letters on a page and answers in an interview, for the job at which you get taxed half your fucking income and still come to work to put out more value in productivity than they pay you. Selling my labour and having to go above and beyond for so fucking little. I have dreams of reading poetry in the Italian countryside and writing in a French provincial cottage, or reading Korean folklore and myths in seclusion. It's very sad, when I see how much people work for so little and are expected to grateful for it - and at this point, I'm not even sure what it's all for. I am 21 now, retirement age in the UK is around 65 (and the government are looking to increase it) - am I supposed to work my entire life like this? That is 44 years I am expected to work (assuming I ***do*** retire at that age and stop working), and still I am expected by society to raise a family and have kids? We are all being robbed blind of our individual purposes and the right to explore them, right under noses, with our eyes still wide open and no wool over them. The idea that I will be working for someone else to stew in wealth most people will never see until I take my last breath is soul crushing and I would never wish such a lack of purpose on anyone. That's the main thing, isn't it? All this, just for some investor somewhere to buy a painting so tremendously ugly that you wonder how it's even considered art, for more money in my entire road of properties, using the art to stash money in some shell company in the Cayman or Panama. All so that some rich person somewhere can eat caviar and buy fine wines, or even purchase all the drugs and sex workers they want, so that they can live in luxury paid for by the labour of their workers. This subreddit is very profound for me, to see that there are people out there who aren't brainwashed into believing in this treacherous late-stage capitalist dystopia is amazing. To acquire wealth so mammoth, that you face chronic disillusionment and on the verge of an existential crisis because of the sheer fact that you can do nothing forever. All this, so that someone somewhere can pretend to be cultured and gloat to their equally shallow social circle about sending their kids to the best schools, while donating to the school for ***charitable causes \*cough cough\*.***

 I think I might pursue post-grad studies as I am a scholar at heart, because the job recruitment process is set up to ensure that the people they hire aren't hiring the best, only the most confident and verbally self-assured. It shouldn't take this much effort - so people have spent so much money, put themselves in life-long debt they will never pay off, time and effort to make themselves more employable only to be told they aren't good enough for a role they would happily train someone else in. I wonder sometimes what employers even want from candidates. Pigs to fly? ""Tell me about yourself"", will that help me do my role better? (This question in particular makes me nervous because I don't really understand what the purpose of this is supposed to mean.) Do they expect some robotic, concise answer or some free flowing conversation? I have social anxiety, and my words get stuck and my throat closes up, sometimes to the point I can't breathe properly and I have to stop to compose myself. Then I start worrying and playing all these questions in my head because I don't know what they expect from me. That is not fair, nor is it right. I think I will end this post here, or else I might never finish it. I would like to hear everyone's responses."

Also, after working so hard my whole life, to be rejected by every ivy was really upsetting but I guess it just wasn't meant to be. However, I know college admissions was really screwed up this year so I was thankful to be accepted to multiple amazing universities. If anyone has any advice on where I should go that would be greatly appreciated. Wherever I go, I have decided that I am going to switch my major to finance (for the schools I was accepted to as engineering) with the goal of eventually landing a internship and then a job in NYC (I live in PA so while I have accepted I probably won't attend college nearby, I really want to come back and move to NYC/NJ/PA area) so I would greatly APPRECIATE any advice on where I would have the best shot of doing this at because right now I am lost on where to attend lol."

**Letters of Recommendation**
11th grade Chemistry teacher(5-6/10): I did not do well in chemistry but pulled out an A in the class. She didn’t know me that well bc of online school :/ but she’s cool so I hope it was a good letter.

12th grade English teacher (7/10): I make a lot of bold predictions about literary symbolism and am pretty active in her class, so I hope she wrote about that. Again, I didn’t know her super well at the time she wrote the letter, but I hope it was positive.

Guidance Counselor (8/10): He knows me pretty well and has said really nice things about me, hopefully he said those things in the letter too!

I think my LORs may have been a weak spot in my application. I was remote for all of 11th grade whereas most of my school was in person, and most teachers at my school just fill out formats for recommendations. I don’t think any of them were negative, they just weren’t incredible either.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviews**

Yale (8/10): It was good! My interviewer had a really cool profession and we agreed on a lot of political issues so we could talk about that. He shared some PPT slides and local data with me which I found pretty cool.

Princeton (9/10): My Princeton interviewer was so cool man, I miss him. We talked about a bunch of stuff and it felt like such a chill conversation. I don’t remember the exact details but I remember feeling very happy at the end of it.

Harvard (10/10): My interviewer wasn’t very talkative so I was doing most of the talking. I thought it was only a decent interview until at the end she said I was the most accomplished candidate she’s ever interviewed 😭😭 Really made my heart beat how kind of her I hope she’s doing well.

Columbia (5/10): It felt very rushed and formal. Just meh.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**
 Common App Essay (7/10): It was just good, not great. Writing and personality was solid, but the content was a little mundane. I wrote about how I went from hating piano and refusing to learn it as a child to teaching myself how to play it later on in life and using it for my compositions. I tied it into my love of math and politics as well by emphasizing the embracement of challenge and how passion can come from it.

Supplements (8/10): really varied from school to school, I was really proud of some of them, others were just okay. Overall I think they were very strong though. I talked about a bunch of things from politics to film scoring to my culture, etc.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Central Florida (full ride)

* Georgia Institute of Technology (RD)

*Waitlists:*

* University of Virginia (EA deferred to RD waitlist)

* Yale University (EA deferred to RD rejected)(dream school 😢😢)
* Stanford University (RD)(had already accepted it by this point so it was fine)

**Additional Information:**
I sent a composition portfolio along with my LOCI to Yale, but it wasn’t my best work so kinda silly of me. 

I really thought things were going to end up differently. I knew the chances were low at each individual school but I had faith that at least one of them would pull through. Alas, an Ivy or ivy+ school is not in my future, at least for undergrad. I’m still very thankful to have some good options, but the rejections will sting for quite a while. It is what it is, though, who knows what the future will hold?"

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

*LORS:*

AP US History Teacher (9/10): We had a close relationship. I did in person last year so she got to see me and interact with me in person. Gave me an award at the end of the year.

AP Physics I Teacher (7/10): She liked me and I did well in her class and participated a lot. But we really didn't have too close of a relationship. It was a good rec, but not stellar.

*Essay:*

Common App (9/10): College counselor really liked it. The staff at the college counseling company said it was funny and said a lot about me.

UMich (8/10): Why Us essay was really specific and I did a good job at connecting it back to myself. Bit boring at times.

Georgia Tech (9/10): Did a good job at connecting it back to myself. Did a good job at integrating  GTs mission statement.

Purdue (10/10): Extracurricular essay was unique and showed my interest for CS. Did a good job at squeezing in tons of info in the 100 word essays.

UW Madison (5/10): Much of it was copy and pasted from my UMich essay.

UC PIQ (9/10): Talked about the app I coded to help my community. Talked about my leadership experience in robotics. Talked about my interests in data science and CS.

MIT (7/10): Essays were decent but welcome to my world essay was awful.

Stanford (6/10): Kinda rushed because I decided to apply last minute. Long essays were good but short responses were fairly generic.

USC (5/10): Did these super last minute and it was mostly copy and paste from other essays.

Cornell (10/10): Definitely my best essays in terms of writing quality. Did a really good job at integrating Cornell’s core mission.

Vanderbilt (8/10): Copied my UC Leadership essay and added a blurb at the end about how my experiences tie into Vanderbilts mission statement.

Northwestern (9/10): The topic and framing of the essay was definitely the best among my Why Us Essays. 

UVA (5/10): Did these super last minute. Mostly copy and paste

*Interviews:*

MIT (4/10): First interview. Felt more like an interrogation than a conversation. Tripped up multiple times.

Princeton (10/10): Interviewer and I had really good chemistry. He was a  CS professor so we talked about interesting concepts in CS and he told me about Princetons CS department

Also got informational interviews for Michigan and Cornell

Thoughts: I think my downfall was my ECs. They were pretty generic and I didn’t do anything spectacular. I think my ECs were also too CS focused. Don’t be afraid to venture outside of your intended major.

Also, don’t be sad if you get deferred. I was really bummed out about being deferred by Georgia Tech and Michigan but I ended up getting into both RD.

**Also, I need your guy’s help on choosing a school: should I go to Georgia Tech or Michigan?**"
tu8ig5,2,2022-04-01,Internship at a coding bootcamp vs free coding bootcamp,Ok-Cartographer-5544,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tu8ig5/internship_at_a_coding_bootcamp_vs_free_coding/,"I'm a CS student trying to decide what to do for my summer, and have two options:

&amp;#x200B;

**Free Bootcamp:** I'm a veteran and have access to a program called VET TEC which pays for a coding bootcamp along with a living stipend. Only certain bootcamps are approved, but they are typically good ones.

I've heard hack reactor is solid, and would likely use the benefit for this, if I go that route.

The end result would be a $20k hack reactor education.

&amp;#x200B;

**Internship:** Applying for internships hasn't been going well, but I was offered a job at a coding bootcamp where  I can help teach the course as I learn it. the payment is essentially that I get the course for free + a living stipend.

Because I can already get training for free with VET TEC, it's not that great of a deal, but it is nice in that I'd be able to get something to put on my resume.

The end result would be similar to the previous. I'd get a bootcamp education, and experience to put on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Which should I go for?"

So to all those second degree students out there, have you been able to get co-op?

**Letters of Recommendation**

Chemistry and AP Research Teacher (10/10): I've known this guy for 3 years now, we've talked often due to the nature of the classes I took and he also wrote some other letters of rec for me

AP Lit (7/10): didn't know her for that long but she asked me to submit a lot of information to her to help her write the letter of rec. However, I still talked to her often prior to asking for the letter of rec

Counselor (8/10): I've barely spoken to her over the course of 4 years, but the letter of rec packet that you need to submit to the counselor is THICKK. I'm talking 10 pages asking for paragraph length answers, asking you to write a sample letter of rec, giving her a copy of some of my college essays, etc.

**Interviews**

Duke (ED) 8/10: my first college interview, so I was kinda nervous but I thought I did pretty well and hit it off with the interviewer pretty well

Stanford (RD) 9/10: the guy that interviewed me was a lot older than the other interviewers, but he was super involved with the science department at Stanford as well as the UC where he said he worked. We had a super insightful conversation about the field of science and the joys of making a breakthrough.

UPenn (RD) 10/10: I hit it off with this guy immediately. He was pretty young too, a grad student that was majoring in bio. He was also Asian, which for some reason made me feel like I could talk to him more about my life but this guy was also super cool. He kinda reminded me of someone who you'd meet at a local Chinese restaurant who'd walk up to you if you looked uncomfortable.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: I spent about a month on it. I wrote about how I found my love of cooking through my parents and grandparents, how I'd watch them and try to replicate them. I related it to my interest in Pharmacology and Chemistry, where you'd take different components, with different properties, and how understanding these properties and experimentation leads to the creation of something beautiful. I asked a couple of my friends to peer review it and my AP Lit teacher also proofread it since it was actually one of the assignments we had at the beginning of the year.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Purdue (EA), 10k/year
* UW Madison (EA)
* CU Boulder (EA), honors and 6k/year
* Penn State (rolling)
* UC Riverside
* UC Davis
* Northeastern (deferred then accepted NU Bound), 12k/year
* \*\*UC Santa Barbara, (\*\*one of my top schools since they have a 5 year bs/ms Pharmacology program)

*Waitlists:*

* UC San Diego

*Rejections:*

* Duke (ED)
* Johns Hopkins (ED II)
* UCLA
* UCI (kinda surprising)
* UC Berkeley
* USC (probably the one I wanted to go to the most)
* NYU
* UPenn
* Brown
* Stanford

Overall, not bad. I was hoping to get into one of my reaches since I thought my Stanford and USC essays were amazing but that's just how the cookie crumbles. I'm currently deciding between UW Madison, Purdue, and UCSB since they're some of the top schools for Pharmacology. I'll be visiting these schools during Spring break next week. I'm not super bummed out since I'm still planning on going for a PhD, so grad school will matter more than where I go for undergrad."

Reason to worry is: 
- Don’t have prior working experiences
- Cannot take internships
- Have had foreign friends (graduated with degrees like business and accounting) who could not land a job in Singapore

Are the chances to land a job in Singapore as a fresh graduate with a Bachelor in CS degree very slim without prior working experiences?

I’ve heard that CS is quite a hot market and it is relatively easy for locals to land a job, but is it also a similar case for foreign students?

Thank you in advance!!"

I was wondering if anyone can give me an idea if I had been rejected or not or If I should follow up at all.

Around March 10th I interviewed for an internship at Raytheon RMD, and it was an interesting position it seems, and also the only interview I was lucky to get lol.  The interview I think went well and the interviewer and I seemed to vibe as he went to my school as an undergrad. The next day he emailed me saying I should get feedback before the end of March.  I received an email earlier this week saying I should hear back soon as this week is the final round of interviews.

I did not hear anything today or yesterday so I am hoping that maybe next week I will hear back or I did not get rejected immediately.   I was wondering if I should email next week on Monday or wait a little bit. I do not want to seem offputting!

Thank you for any advice! I wish getting an internship or getting an interview was not so difficult lol

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Over the weekend I got a call from my interviewer that I got the job! I am so happy to actually have an internship! He said I was the top applicant and that he wanted to tell me before the paperwork was sent."

**Letters of Recommendation**

**apush teacher**: i LOVE this man. he was easily the best teacher i've ever had, even though junior year was over Zoom. he constantly used my essays as the class exemplar and i also feel like we got to know each other as people. when i met him earlier this year to give him a gift and thank him for writing my LOR, he wished me luck and told me that he knew i was going to end up at a great school and his LOR would serve me well.

**honors physics teacher**: she's really sweet, like kind grandmother energy. i always did my best to participate and solve the example problems she put up. i also went to her office hours when i had questions, but i definitely wasn't a physics superstar or anything. when i met her in person to thank her and give her a gift, she said she loved having me in her class and appreciated how much i always participated in the Zoom chat.

**activity #1 recommender:** spoke about what i've done at the start-up, especially as one of the youngest directors/team leaders there. he also wrote a LOR that got me into the HYPSM research internship, so i hope it was strong :)

**Interviews**

* **Georgetown**: *9/10* it was my first interview ever so i was a little nervous, but my interviewer was really friendly and easy to talk to. afterwards he emailed me and asked if he could interview me a second time (!?) to add more to his notes, so we had a phone call and talked more!
* **Case Western:** *8/10* this was one of the systems where you register for your own interview. by the time i realized this, there was only one slot left: 6am on a monday. i'm not a morning person but i woke up early and talked with a current student (we were close in age and she had such big-sister energy), but i didn't manage to bring up everything i wanted to. love how CWRU interviewers send a personalized note mentioning things that you talked about :))
* **Northwestern**: *1000/10* we clicked so well and i literally wouldn't have changed a thing about how it went. at the end she kept telling me how she'd never written this many notes for anyone before, and thought I was very ""mature and articulate"" with an ""extremely bright future ahead"" and she was so excited for me. i did not stop smiling for an hour afterwards, she made my whole week
* **Harvard:** *7/10* this lady was so intimidating, she had her own wikipedia page! she also mentioned in her introductory email that i should notify her if anyone else was in *hearing range* because she wanted total privacy. then she rescheduled our interview because she was touring the country to promote her book. during the interview she just said, ""tell me about yourself, and then let me know if you have any questions about harvard,"" so i directed the conversation rather than answering questions. at the end she said, ""harvard could admit 2,000 more students and still have an incredibly strong class. what makes you different from other applicants?"" - and i thought i was able to answer it well. ultimately i did find some common ground with her, and at the end she said i had a ""very strong sense of self, which is rare"" and asked me to stay in touch + keep her posted on my harvard decision.
* **Tufts:** *6/10* we were pretty close in age and grew up around the same general area so i felt ready to connect w him! however his audio didn't work in the beginning so i was just repeating ""so sorry i can't hear you"" for a full minute. i was also pretty tired that day and ended up asking a weak question about whether he'd been able to explore concepts across different fields at tufts. he essentially implied that a lot of schools offered that (my soul died). then he was attacked by a fly in his room and ducked off screen for like 10 seconds (??). however he did laugh at my jokes and said i had an interesting background and that i seemed like i'd get involved with a specific opportunity he brought up? not sure what to make of it honestly

**Essays**

* **common app:** hard to explain without giving away a ton of personal details. basically i wrote about my relationship with my grandma as a lens for my journey with a medical condition, using an inside joke between us. i made sure to focus on growth/what i've taken away from dealing with it rather than an ""oh, woe is me!"" angle &amp; included some cute touches about our culture and a mantra that's been passed through our family. showed it to three english teachers who all loved it and said it was a pleasure to read, my parents really liked it too.
* **additional info:** dealt with a chronic medical condition that gave me physical pain, guidance counselor mentioned this in a LOR. thankfully i'm nearly done with treatment/pain because this condition is less dangerous past skeletal maturity.

i tried really hard on my supplementals (wrote \~58 total essays, i think? counting USC short answers as one), also sent off a bunch of emails to AOs asking about specific programs for those lovely demonstrated interest points

**\*\*Decisions!!\*\***

senior year was the most uncertain few months of my life - during december and january, i had vivid recurring stress nightmares of going portal to portal and seeing ""we regret to inform you"" at all of them. here's what actually happened:

***Acceptances*** ***(3)***

* **Baylor EA**, neuroscience with $56,000 merit scholarship + my #1 choice program in the Honors College!
* **University of Washington RD**, pre-biology, waitlisted for Honors Program
* **Santa Clara University RD,** biology (didn't apply for honors)

***Waitlists / Other (4)***

* **Northeastern EA,** accepted cell/molecular biology but for NU Bound :(
* **Boston College RD**, waitlisted
* **Case Western Reserve University:** deferred EA  --&gt; waitlisted RD
   * notified me that i'd receive a $19,000 merit scholarship if admitted off the waitlist (??)
* **Boston University RD**, guaranteed transfer for fall 2023, neurobiology

***Rejections*** ***(19)***

* **UChicago ED1** (so sad that my essay about an intergalactic space cow named bessie, nuclear warfare on earth, and the ""dark forest"" ethics of contacting alien civilizations wasn't quirky enough)
* **UCLA RD**
* **UCSD RD**
* **UCSB RD**
* **UC Berkeley RD**
* **Rice RD**
* **Northwestern RD**
* **University of Michigan:** deferred EA  --&gt; rejected RD
* **USC RD**
* **Carnegie Mellon RD**

* **NYU CAS RD** \[my actual dream school. regret not applying ED.\]
* **Brown RD**
* **Harvard RD**
* **Columbia RD**
* **Emory RD**
* **Stanford RD**

**\* REFLECTION \***

i was completely shell-shocked by the decisions.

with a 1570 SAT, 4.0+ weighted GPA at high rigor, seven leadership positions, 750 volunteer hours, a selective HYPSM research internship, major national news coverage, shotgunning 25+ colleges — *I couldn't even get into a T50?*

i'd naively believed that stats weren't everything, that my personality and the things that i genuinely cared about would carry me through. i'd worked so hard.

in a panic, i searched for some glaring oversight in my application. was it my essays? i'd spent endless hours crafting my narrative and carefully polishing the phrasing of all 58 essays, making sure to avoid overdone cliches or red flags like mental illness. i researched very niche programs at each school, brainstormed interesting stories for each prompt. and since i was really little, i've been praised for my writing. my ap english teacher even told me that my common app was one of the best he'd ever read.

i don't think i have a terrible personality - i'm surrounded by genuine, kind friends. in most clubs/orgs, i usually end up getting voted into leadership by my classmates, so there must be something likable about me?

was it a negative LOR? i really love my teachers and believe they feel the same way about me. my apush teacher is known for writing really strong LORs, and my physics teacher actually turned someone down because she felt like she didn't know him well enough but she agreed to write mine. it seems really unlikely that i was hurt there.

after some agony, i realized i was just in denial about the massive importance of GPA (either that, or i'm completely oblivious to some huge red flag.)

i'm a STEM applicant from a hypercompetitive region where most other STEM applicants to these top schools have put GPA first and gone through very difficult coursework with 3.8+ unweighted. i got straight As in my humanities classes, and many Bs in major-related STEM courses. our school doesn't rank us, but i'm definitely not in the top quartile by unweighted. so why would anyone admit me for a heavily competitive major like biology? in local context, i must look awful.

some of my friends who had better outcomes applied for envirosci, history, or cultural/gender studies (with the plan to switch after being admitted). what i was i thinking when i went for a STEM major?

i really screwed up by thinking that Bs in difficult STEM classes were okay if i ""balanced"" my GPA with other parts of my app — and for still applying for biology/neuro in that situation.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE @ everyone in a low GPA / high SAT situation, don't be naive or fall into magical thinking.

if you're financially able, please apply ED to a target school that you can see yourself being happy at. maybe it's not your first choice, but it's better than ending up at one of your last choices. my biggest regret is not applying ED to my actual dream school (NYU) or CWRU / BC (who liked me enough RD to waitlist me).

i also wish i'd applied to more targets - Brandeis, William &amp; Mary, Tulane, maybe even some liberal-arts schools like Wesleyan.

you can seek out feel-good stories online about a 3.6/3.7 with lots of course rigor and good ECs getting into a T30, but those cases are extremely rare or outdated (also the low GPA could be a massive upward trend with straight As in the niche subject they're majoring in).

**\* COLLEGE DECISION \***

**After 26 applications (and a lot of emotional damage), I'll be attending UW Seattle '26 this fall, and this time I'll be putting GPA** **as my #1 priority** **+ directing my energy into my dream of med school.**

* won't take BU's guaranteed fall 2023 transfer, considering their infamous premed grade deflation

i'm trying not to be bitter over this crushing admissions cycle (because i did have extremely high expectations), and i'm very grateful for my opportunity at UW Seattle. go Huskies!

^(P.S. if you have a theory for why this went so badly, please share. i'm actually worried that i'm an inherently bad person or something)"

I've applied for an intern position at Google. I've passed the first interviews and did the host matching ones. Then afterwards, I got an email saying that one of the interviewers would like to proceed with me on their team. However, the email explicitly said that this was not an offer and they still had to submit the project match for final review. Now I'm waiting for an answer, but I get quite anxious with that...

I've wanted to celebrate, but now I'm not sure if something could still go wrong. Do any of you have an idea of how long they usually take for doing the final review and extending an offer?

Thanks!"

My mom is like this and it’s frustrating to no end. One of her friends found out that I work in investment banking (think Goldman, etc). So she was asking my mom about it. My mom literally doesn’t know anything about my job except it involves some accounting / analysis / client portfolios. So she downplayed my job and she didn’t even talk about what I did. I’m not asking her to explain why my job is difficult, but it hurt to have her downplay it. It made my job look unimportant, especially because she didn’t even know the exact description of it.

When she got home, she scolded me. She told me to stop lying to people that I work in investment banking. I was shocked because I never told people about it ( I don’t update my LinkedIn due to a stalking incident, I get jobs thanks to internships + grades on my resume). I may have mentioned that I worked in IB once to a friend who wanted to break into the industry, but that’s it. 

But my mom gave me so much grief that I was making my job sound more important than it was. She told me to stop describing it as investment banking because it was arrogant. I told her I don’t know how her friend found out, but my exact job description that I received from HR called the job “investment banking,” and even my boss called it “investment banking,” so even if I had “bragged” about being in IB, I wouldn’t have been lying. Then she replied, “Well, I don’t care, even if it’s investment banking I want you to stop telling people it is, they’ll think you’re bragging.” And I was like??? Never told people where I work in the first place but okay??? 

Not only did she downplay my achievements and make me look like I was exaggerating, but she also told me to lie to make my job look bad. I feel terrible. Like she’s gaslighting me. I went to check my job description and it literally says the words there + the word analyst. 😭 Idk anymore. 

It wasn’t until she asked me to clean a room that I found her old gold name pin from when she worked at my current company in the 90s. Yes, she worked in my exact bank before getting married. She used to brag to me about having a difficult job opening people’s bank accounts for them, how she was overqualified for her job coz she was a CPA. And I’m not downplaying what she did: Getting a CPA is amazing. But she always emphasized that she was hired because she was pretty and smart, and since my own job is more of front/mid office combo (as opposed to 100% client facing like hers), I was probably not pretty enough to have her exact role of greeting clients. 

Well, I found her precious golden pin with her name on it and it turns out she was a customer service officer at my bank back in the 90s. Like it literally says Customer Service Officer. Nothing to be ashamed about, but it turns out she was lying about her position to me and my family for the longest time. She made it sound like it was incredibly difficult and mind-blowing. It made me realize she was probably embarrassed for lying to us and angry I had a higher position than her in my bank now. Again, her job wasn’t even bad, so I don’t know why she had lied. But indeed, she had lied about what she did for years. Her excuse was that the bank just called her that but she was actually doing top secret important stuff. Whatever. My family members are just silent here. I’m sure they think both of us are lying some way or the other, which was incredibly frustrating until I learnt not to care anymore. 

I don’t doubt she actually did some difficult stuff in the banking industry, but for the most part, she lied about what she did + she lied about her title. She kept calling herself some other thing and insisted that Customer Service Officer was a fake name (despite having her name on that pin) and she was actually the one doing the most important and difficult thing for clients. So maybe she’s not lying 100%; however, she exaggerated the scope of her job and kept giving us a new title for her job. She made it sound like she was doing everything in the job when she really wasn’t. Meanwhile, I had just parroted what was written on my job offer letter. Yes, there were challenges in her job, but for the most part she later admitted that she was just sitting around waiting to greet clients and unlock safes for them. She also admitted it was only difficult because you had to greet people, and she wasn’t doing actual tough analysis (again, nothing wrong with that, I think Customer Service Officer is a great job, but boy did she exaggerate her job at first). 

Honestly, what she’s done has scared me so much that I won’t even tell people I work in investment banking. I’ll just call myself an analyst. Even though the word investment banking is right there in my job description. I’ll just keep quiet, like I always have done, and just…just try to make my way quietly and successfully in this world."

**What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 Words)**

Radical spirits of nationalism hinder cultural preservation efforts and the formation of intercultural societies.

i think a really important thing is updating your colleges. i did ECS that i genuinely enjoyed, so i kept doing them throughout senior year and had very significant updates. i actually even ended up becoming an ISEF finalist, but wasn't able to update colleges w/ that. in all, i sent about 3-4 updates, which is way more than they recommend.

another thing is how understated essays are said to be. i wrote about v v unique topics that all discussed how my worldview was broadened. i think most were pr memorable"

tudukr,11,2022-04-02,Sometimes I just feel so incapable,Unnatural_Dis4ster,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tudukr/sometimes_i_just_feel_so_incapable/,"Hi y'all,

**TL;DR: I feel like I'm losing all my executive function day by day and it's frustrating to feel like I can't do anything about it.**

I really just need some space to rant/get my thoughts out about having ADHD - it's just one of those kinds of nights. 

I've been feeling really discouraged, frustrated, and upset lately about my current state of ADHD. Just a quick background - I grew up with several blatant symptoms (well, blatant in hindsight) that were ignored and only recently (\~ 1 year ago) was diagnosed. I finally got medicated - after seeing so many success stories, I was disappointed to discover life wasn't magically easy. Don't get me wrong, things are so much easier, but they are still, for the most part, not easy.

I honestly don't know what I'd do if I had to have waited any longer for a diagnosis and medication. Over the past three or so years, I've just felt all the skills and coping mechanisms I developed as to make it through my childhood just crumble. I'm not sure if others experience this, but I feel as though I can't even identify what those skills were, all I know is that certain things were easier before and now they just feel harder and I feel like I'm not using those coping mechanisms even though I don't even really know what those mechanisms were; and I find that super frustrating. It's like I can almost feel myself losing all this function and ability and if I only knew what those skills were, maybe I'd be able to practice them or something to get them back, but I don't. It's just really sad to be honest.

Feeling the loss of those skills is really difficult to cope with. I find my working memory is giving me problems every single day. I can't go more than probably two hours without completely forgetting what I'm doing or thinking about. It's just so draining to have to sit there and back track through what I was doing to get back on that train of thought and I feel really defeated. To make it worse, I get super frustrated with myself because I'm aware that I'm forgetting things.

Making it to events on time and getting things done on time, too, is becoming impossible. I just feel no motivation to do anything and end up always spending a few too many minutes sleeping in or playing on my phone before I have to be somewhere. I also can never get anything handed in on time. As a student in college, I feel so incapable, constantly having to ask for extensions and/or forgiveness for turning things in late. It's just exhausting and I feel so childish. I'm quite honestly embarrassed to even talk to some of my professors about anything now, let alone a late assignment because I can't help but feel like I'm that student that never turns anything in on time. In addition to being late, my focus will often drift away from the lecture and onto something to do on my computer and I just feel so bad because I feel like the professors are watching me not pay attention in class when, in reality, doing something on my computer lets me at least listen to what they're saying whereas doing nothing just staring at the board just leads to me daydreaming. It just feels so embarrassing.

My head just feels like such a mess all of the time. I just feel so uncomfortable in my own head because on one hand I've got all of these technical skills and knowledge that I'm pretty good at and on the other hand, I can't actually do most of it in any impactful capacity because I can't maintain focus for long enough to complete anything. It's a really weird contrast because I feel super proud about all of things I've learned and the skills I've developed, but also so dumb and incapable that I can't execute anything using those skills.

Another piece of my frustration is that I try so hard to fix all of it but it's never enough. I spent so much time getting in to the psychiatrist to do an evaluation and then so much time getting my medication. I try so many different solutions to keeping myself organized. I try to get myself to stay motivated and get things done on time using hundred of different methods, but it all just feels like it's never enough. The shear amounts of effort I put in with such little reward is so discouraging. On almost a weekly basis, I'll go through a cycle of trying to get everything setup and put together in my life and then it won't work well enough and I'll just sit there, already exhausted from the work I did to set myself up for success, and now I have to expend effort fixing the mistakes I made all while feeling incapable and ashamed of myself. It's exhausting.

Feeling all this while also feeling like I'm watching myself lose the coping mechanisms and skills I used in the past is so disheartening. There is not a day that goes by where I don't feel like I'm losing. I think the worst of it is I think I'm very self aware - I can notice when and how my ADHD is affecting me but I just don't know how to stop it. I just feel so stuck in it - ya know? I also feel just so weird because I'm so aware - I'm not mad at me myself per se, I'm mad at my ADHD. At the same time, though, my ADHD is so intertwined with how I operate these days that it's hard to separate me from my ADHD mentally which leaves me often feeling really dissociated inside.

If you took the time to read through this whole rant - thank you, I hope it provided some validation if you're going through the same. Also, I'm sure a lot of the issues I'm having are a result of compounding factors like COVID, senior year of college, and a stressful internship in tandem with my ADHD. Regardless, I'm holding out hope to be better one day and not have to feel so defeated all the time by my ADHD. While I feel really upset about it, I know things will eventually get better. Have a good day y'all."

tufb1w,9,2022-04-02,Software Engineer Internship,chinnysnowflake,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/tufb1w/software_engineer_internship/,"
Hi, I’m a 4th year IT student and I’m about to start internship this month.

I have received an offer as Software Engineer (Java, Microservices, Backend). I really enjoy programming but I feel like nakalimutan ko na ng onti yung mga naaral namin before since we shifted to online class due to covid protocols, and now I’m getting anxious and nagdadalawang isip if tama ba na i-take ko yung software engineer path. I’m also starting to feel intimidated with the job itself, like what if my skills are not good enough.

Honestly, I really want to take the Database Admin path but I heard that companies rarely get interns for this kasi it plays a big role so I guess programmer nalang muna ako for internship, tutal I enjoy programming pero is it enough ba to grab the Software Engineer opportunity? Baka naman nageenjoy lang ako before dahil simple lang yung mga projects namin ☹️"

Now I'm wondering if recruiters even look at linkedIns or not or do they become more important as you apply for higher positions or something?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

i had four letters of rec:

9th grade english: we had an amazing relationship, so even tho i had her class years ago, i still wanted her to write me a letter of recommendation because i know it would be 1. amazing and 2. a nice keepsake!

10th grade english: probably the best letter i had. she spoke so highly of me and my accomplishments, and also spoke very highly of my behavior in class and how i was a good role model to my peers. def her getting her a present before the year ends!

11th grade AP human geo: also a really good letter! he was (slightly) more critical of me, but i think it helped colleges take his writing more seriously: i’m not perfect, but i’m up there for sure. may get him a present as well!

11th and 12th grade AP bio and anatomy, respectively: loved this letter sm! i wanted to ask her bc i had her for two years, back to back! i think it helped colleges see that i’m pretty consistent with my behavior and commitment to excellence!

**Interviews**

yale: 5/10 nice convo, but there were technical lag issues + she seemed a bit bored

washington &amp; lee: really good!! still hated the school tho LOL

dartmouth: amazing 10/10. he was so nice and he seemed to really enjoy our conversation :) 

**Essays**

i love writing. writing my essays was honestly kinda fun; the prompts were interesting and made me think! 

i’m most proud of my commonapp essay :) i used the religious meaning behind my nigerian name as a controlling metaphor for the disconnect i felt between two parts of myself, being nigerian and queer. in my culture, we have naming ceremonies for newborns, and so i talked about having my own private renaming ceremony in my backyard one night in july, to mark the day i accepted all parts of myself equally, wholly, and fully.

tukf0m,8,2022-04-02,Should I get a masters or PhD if either option is paid for?,moolman1,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/tukf0m/should_i_get_a_masters_or_phd_if_either_option_is/,"Hey guys,

So I’m a junior undergraduate electrical engineering student at VCU and have been approached by a few people and professors asking me to do grad school. I have an immense passion for electrical engineering, in particular radio microwave electronics. I already have an internship lined up in that exact field and they have said that they would potentially pay for my masters. However, a great benefit of VCU is that PhD students education is paid for, and I wouldn’t really have to pay much if not anything. 

I’ve been trying to figure out which way I would like to go, should I get a masters or should I get a PhD. I’ve here several conflicting thoughts on this and would like to see other people’s opinions on the subject. For me, I love making my own projects at home and coming up with my own solutions, however I do not want to go into academia as of now.

Let me know your thoughts!!!"

**Interviews**

Duke: 0/10 didn't get an interview smh

Tufts: 7/10 She kept saying that she was going to write a really great review for me but I feel like I didn't say much; most of the interview was just her giving me advice and showing me the wild parakeets that showed up at her balcony (I rate parakeets 10/10)

**Final thoughts**

AOs are smart; I had so many arguments with my parents because I didn't want to apply to Berkeley and USC, and I guess that reflected in my applications. I'll probably go to UCLA which disappoints some people who still think I should have applied for ivies, but it's been my dream school for half my life, and I just don't think my vibe fits with an Ivy League school. At the end of the day I have no regrets and I hope y'all remember to have fun through all the stress!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor Rec (7/10)- I didn't know my counselor that well, but I gave her my brag sheet and we talked for like 30 minutes about the letter. My transfer student tour guide means I work on a daily basis with the counselors, so I got really close to my counselor throughout the year, but I'm not sure how good it was when she wrote it.

Teacher #1 (10/10)- I had this math teacher from 10th to 12th grade, and got really close to him before he wrote this rec. He's also known at my school for writing awesome rec letters to even kids who he didn't know that well, so I'm very confident mine was great.

Teacher #2 (6/10)- I asked my AP Lang teacher because I really didn't know who to ask. He's pretty commonly asked but is known for mediocre recs for people he doesn't know that well. Because of Covid, I never got to become that close with him, so I'm not that sure this rec was that good.

Additional Rec (Submitted at most of my schools) (8/10)- I asked the President of the company I interned my Junior Summer for this rec. He allowed me to review the rec and ask for changes, so I was able to shape the rec the way I wanted it. However, I didn't work with him for a long enough time for this rec to be *that* great.

Dartmouth Peer Rec (10/10)- I asked a really close friend (basically my older sister) and I have 100% faith in her so...

**Interviews**

Lol so I did 21 interviews, so I won't go into every single one, but the ones that stood out were:

Really Good Interviews:

* Northwestern- We talked about debating in college and people we both knew for like an hour
* Vanderbilt- Our conversation went REALLY REALLY well- she even told me which bars in Nashville were the best...

Not so great Interviews:

* Yale- I had this really old interviewer whom I had no shared interests with whatsoever. We did talk for a long time but it was mostly him rambling about his experiences.
* MIT- Very similar to Yale, my interviewer just rambled for an hour
* Penn- My interviewer didn't allow for a conversation to happen, he sort of just asked a list of questions and said goodbye

**Essays**

My personal statement was a really personal story of how I overcame one of my greatest insecurities. I put months into this essay (14 revisions I believe) until I was happy with it. I talked with some admissions people at my accepted schools recently and many of them gushed over my essay, so I'd like to think my personal statement was a big reason for my success.

I don't think my supplements were that great, I reused a lot (probably too much), probably had too many cliche topics, and didn't do much research on individual schools. I guess this is what happens when you apply to 30 schools I guess!

tum5ep,17,2022-04-02,Admit Choice Dilemma,frizzid07,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tum5ep/admit_choice_dilemma/,"I have an admit for MS Computer Science from Stony Brook and another admit for Master of Computer Science from UC Irvine. Really struggling to make a choice between these.

Some pros and cons that I have compiled so far-

UCI Pros: Reputation, Location, Shorter &amp; more-focused professional program

UCI Cons: Expensive Housing, No TA/RA, Unreliability of getting good internships (this is a personal finding from many LinkedIn searches and frequent conversations with current UCI grads)

Stony Brook Pros: Affordable, great program with a focus on Data Science/AI, great internship record, ample TA/RA opportunities

Stony Brook Cons: Chilled Weather (for someone flying out of India), Lack of public transport

I would really appreciate your two cents about these unis. Pls feel free to add any of the pros or cons you know about either unis. Thanks in advance!"

1. Captain of school science bowl team/co-founder and leading coach of local middle school science bowl team: Our high school team wasn't really that good tbh but the years I was captain we actually advanced to elimination rounds (maybe since it was virtual too). On the other hand, the middle school science bowl team I coached was actually really good. We placed in our regional the first year, and then the next two years we won and advanced to nationals.

3. Founder of 501(c)(3) non profit (certified this year), hosted STEM advocacy activities. Wasn't super big (I didn't want a big team or anything) but we had some decent events.
4. Debate: Just a member but went to a lot of tournaments, qualified for the TOC. Was a bit saturated but I was one of the only people in my school/grade to qualify even though there were other kids with leadership positions.
5. Software Internship at a local tech startup: Requirement for a comp sci program in my school but I did it early and the company rarely, if ever, took high schoolers at all.
6. Volunteered at many hospitals/clinics (3 of which I put on the common app), including a COVID tent that I talked about in my essays.
7. VP of a Politics club at my school: Mostly for fun tbh, we just hang around and discussed political issues, sometimes had guest speakers.

1. Debate TOC Qualifier and other debate awards
2. International BioGENEius Finalist
3. Several awards from science fair, including one from a T10 school alumni association
4. AP Scholar with Distinction (I didn't wanna put this but my college advisor made me)

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Chemistry/Seminar &amp; Research Teacher (7/10): talked to him a lot, came for help, small class size in Seminar and Research really boosted our relationship, but at the same time, he asked for a resume and literally forgot about half the stuff I've done, plus he doesn't really love me over the moon but we have a respectable relationship.

AP Lang (5/10): It was virtual so I had a harder time making relationships with teachers. I did try coming in and asking questions a lot, but generally we didn't talk that much.

Comp Sci Teacher (6/10): This guy is really dry and has a reputation in the school. He actually got mad when I first asked him to write for me since he said it was too late but he eventually did it. We have a weird Mr. Miyagi relationship like most other students where he sometimes likes when I ask questions and seems like he likes me but also doesn't have much patience and tends to roast people. Plus, I got a B in his class in senior year, so I only submitted to a few schools.

Local University Research Mentor (9/10): Really good relationship, worked closely with them a lot, really nice guy, plus we had the benefit of the science fair awards and presentations.

T10 Research mentor (7/10): Nice guy, super chill tbh, we talk a lot and he seems to like me, but I don't think I stood out in any particular way.

Internship Mentor (8/10): Worked with a lot during the internship, asked a lot of questions and was interested in the work, plus I brought him on as a board member of my non profit

Local Clinic Mentor (9/10): Really nice person, I enjoyed working with her a lot, and she was so encouraging!

Counselor (6.5/10): We've talked a lot about the college process and she knows about my accomplishments but otherwise we aren't really close together.

**Interviews**

Georgetown (7/10): My interviewer was the sister of someone who was literally in my grade lmao. Nice interview overall, answered the questions well, and asked a lot, pretty standard. She came 15 minutes late though and then apologized in her response to my thank you email, and her sister said the same thing to.

MIT (7/10): Pretty standard, talked about how it was a problem solving school, gave some nice responses to the more weird questions, but could've been better.

UPenn (5/10): It was ok, but I kinda didn't have special reasons for why I wanted to go to UPenn. Mostly standard.

Northwestern (8/10): Really liked overall. Interestingly, the interviewer scheduled for early January, then got COVID and ghosted me for 2 weeks, then responded back and we had our interview. We connected on a lot of issues and she said I gave unique answers to a lot of the things she asked. Only weak spot was the question on how I'll contribute to Northwestern.

Tufts (9/10): Also really really enjoyed this interview. The questions were weird but I answered pretty well. It was also kind of short so we just conversed for another 20 minutes afterwards.

**Essays**

Common App (7/10): Interesting concept on food and failure, pretty decent overall, though nothing special. I had a college counseling service help me with this which did not go well at all, but I got through it.

Supplements (8/10): Pretty good, I liked them a lot, most of them were really good though some could've been better.

**Thoughts/Reflection:**

I'm kind of sad and disappointed, but also intrigued by my results. First, for context, while my GPA might look high, its actually pretty average for my school system. I knew my GPA wasn't that good but a) I had an upward trend and b) I tried compensating with ECs and test score. I had so many worries and dreams about the application season since I wanted a school with the intellectual fit (I had a lot of bullying and loneliness experiences throughout my life so I really wanted an escape so much). I really thought that colleges would look past my GPA and see my other aspects of my application. But I learned this year that I was sort of wrong, but also slightly right at the same time.

If I could any piece of advice, its that you should maintain your GPA at all costs. If the GPA's not good, then colleges will be more hesitant to examine other parts of the application. Second, rigor is sort of subjective and doesn't necessarily make up for a weaker GPA. Now obviously you can't just slide with easy classes but at the same time, 10 APs and 15 APs may not be considered much of a difference. I know kids who took half the amount of APs I took and got into better colleges. If you're gonna take the most rigorous course load, you better be prepared to do well with it. Also, my Bs were in some hard STEM classes which isn't a great look for a STEM major; for whatever you want to do, do well in it.

However, I will say that I was somewhat surprised with many of my waitlists. Some were a little weird and I do feel like were yield protection, but others were actually surprising. Obviously waitlists are hard to get out of but I feel a little relieved that my application wasn't total trash to some top-tier colleges. Honestly, if anything, waitlists have made me more mad since I usually just shrug and move on with my rejection, but waitlists feel like the college is baiting me and saying I'm good but can't go yet. The application season has stressed me out so much and on one hand, I know waitlist is impossible to be lifted from and I should just stop and commit, but also I want to give it a shot, especially since some of the colleges are ones I actually want to go to.

The things that I regret but feel sad about so much was a) taking a college counseling service, and b) applying to BS/MD schools. My mentor at the service just kept saying I should ED to a target school and that no matter what, I wouldn't be competitive for some T20s. I kept persisting and had this feeling that I needed to prove that I was capable and make a statement but now I feel so stupid for even trying. She also kept telling me my common app drafts sucked and needed to go back to the drawing board, and it took several months until we got it right (we started in the summer and finally finished in September). I hated her so much and eventually I stopped contacting her and just decided to do things on my own. For the BS/MD schools, my parents kind of wanted me to do these and I just did it without realizing that I cared more about the undergrad experience and education than just being a doctor fast. As a result, my acceptances are all basically BS/MD schools without the program, and it sucks because I wasn't interest in most of them at all.

Ultimately, I think I had too much of a superiority complex, assuming that because the ECs of kids who got into some T20s and good schools were weak, I would automatically get in and these schools would give me a pass. I now realize that this was sort of misguided and that the college admissions process is just weird and I shouldn't expect anything. I still feel sort of sad though since it feels like no matter what I did, I would've turned up in the same place and that all my hard work was for nothing. I haven't committed but I am most likely going to URochester, which is a good compromise (open curriculum and more medium size) and I'm happy I at least had that as an option. I'll pursue some waitlists and see what happens but if it doesn't work out, I won't be hung up about it."
tumq6k,7,2022-04-02,Rutgers-NB v. NJIT for CS,Top_Acanthaceae_5053,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/tumq6k/rutgersnb_v_njit_for_cs/,"Intended major: Computer Science

**Rutgers University - NB**

**Rutgers Pros:**

* Bigger school/more people
* Many friends going
* Better social life/""college experience""
* Many people with the same dilemma have chose Rutgers more often
* Better opportunities? (internships, connections)
* Better name outside of NJ for finding job?
* People say I would be happier here (care about happiness for next four years of life)

**Rutgers Cons:**

* Costs 30k/yr for tuition + room/board
* No scholarships or Honors College/Program
* Chance of getting bad dorms (no AC, communal bathrooms)
* Busses to other campuses may be time consuming/annoying

**New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**

**NJIT Pros:**

* Costs 5k/yr for tuition + room/board
* Honors College (Better dorms with private bathrooms, honors courses)
* More tight-knit community in Honors College?
* Smaller classes
* Probably more focused on studying/learning
* Smaller campus (easier to get to classes)

**NJIT Cons:**

* Sometimes describes as ""commuter school""
* Heard the social life is not too good
* No friends going
* Bad area (Newark)
* May not be as happy

The difference in cost between the two is $100k, but my parents will be able to help pay for it without loans. I will want to pay them back, and that might be reasonable as a Software Engineer. In the long term, the difference is about $3k/yr for 30 years, which could be a reasonable sacrifice if I am happier for four important years of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

A few other questions: 

How hard is it to get CS internships at Rutgers? Is it possible to get one after freshman year?

I've heard the dorming situation isn't too great, is this true? I saw that the B.E.S.T hall dorms are pretty nice, so is it too late to get a dorm there (it says first-come first-serve for incoming students)?

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm a pretty stand-out undergrad, but it doesn't seem like employers care. I need some advice on the following options: 

-Grad school: The only reason is because I like math, like research, and want to do more. If employment wasn't a concern, this would 100% be my choice. 

-Job hunt with a bachelor's: I can start making money sooner. Is this a realistic option? Is anyone really hiring math majors to programming/data science roles? 

-Do a fifth year of undergrad to get a CS degree: I'm assuming this would help me land a job. I guess that's the only reason I'd consider it. 

For reference, I don't give a fuck about programming. It's alright, I'd rather program than stock shelves, but I'm not passionate about it. I'm only learning to code because I think it makes me more employable. A job in software engineering would be bearable, but I feel like I'd be relegating my life to something unfulfilling because I need to make money.

tunznd,14,2022-04-02,Update: Kicked Out of Student Teacher Placement,lovelybb00,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/tunznd/update_kicked_out_of_student_teacher_placement/,"In March, I made a post about how I was getting kicked. Since then, I wrote a letter to the Dean and it led to a meeting. Yesterday, I found out that I passed edTPA. It’s been hard to feel happy about passing since I can’t graduate on time, and have to take internship again. 

The reason I’m making another post is because of what happened during the meeting. The Dean expressed concern about my supervisor and how the situation was handled. She told me that there will be more intern support for the Fall semester. 
I told the Dean that I wanted to transfer and I was disgusted that my supervisor wanted me to bribe my CT with gifts. The Dean immediately said “I will give you a scholarship, I will give you a letter of recommendation for jobs, and I’ll make sure you are placed in a good school.” I was shocked with the random offers.

I was told that it was my CT who asked for me to leave, and that they can’t give me another placement until Fall. This made me upset because from the beginning my CT never gave me negative feedback when I asked, but she gave my supervisor all sorts of bad feedback about me. The day before she kicked me out we had a meeting with my supervisor, the CT said that I seemed tired one day because I sat down after a lesson. I’m always standing unless I’m writing problems for math so I asked her to give me a day it happened, she said “I don’t remember?” This was the first time I questioned her directly, and the next day she didn’t want me back in her classroom. I thought a CT was there to mentor you and give feedback throughout your journey? 

Maybe I’m thinking too much but my supervisor and ct always made me feel like I was terrible, but now the Dean and other professors are doing everything in her power to make me stay at the University? Even now I feel like my future cooperating teacher will wonder why I am still an intern after passing edtpa, and it will set a bad image on me. 

What would you guys do in the situation? Should I just ride it out and hope for the best?? It’s really hard for me to trust this school now but the scholarship and letter of recommendation is much needed."

Theology teacher - known for 4 years of hs, did well I'm his class all 4 yrs. very good relationship although our teacher-to-student ratio is 1:27 so he doesn't know me too well tbh. always participated in all his classes all the time. He has a Ph.D. in theology but his LOR was two paragraphs after i pushed him with a lot of source material to write about. 4/10.

The problem is that for entry level roles, they want someone right out of school with no experience. But for anything higher level then that, none of them like my 3 year gap. I seem to be stuck in between. 

While browsing tech job openings, I notice a lot of Recruiter/Technical Recruiter positions. Would it be a stretch for me to go for one of those positions? If not, what are some things I need to know? Any other roles that my experience might be good for that may not be exactly what I had in mind, but still might be something I could land?

Thanks so much for any help or suggestions!"

So 3 weeks ago I got a job offer for an internship at a company I would really like to work for. I had interviewed for them only a week before, and of course I accepted. They acknowledged me accepting the offer within the span of a few minutes, by saying they are excited for me to join the team. I then asked them what the next steps are regarding the internship/hiring process. Since then I haven’t heard anything (related to a background check/drug screen mentioned in job offer) and so I have sent two follow up emails, both getting no response from either the recruiter or from the person who was supposed to be my boss. The internship is due to start in June. Any advice on if I should move on and keep applying or wait for this company to respond? 3 weeks feels like a long time for me personally not to hear anything about the next steps for being hired. 

Appreciate any insight."

turenh,4,2022-04-02,Questions on UofT ECE MEng admission,PPPeterZ,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/turenh/questions_on_uoft_ece_meng_admission/,"I've heard every software-related program is competitive, and I have just got rejected by MScAc lol. I had a CS specialist and Stats Major at UofT. Now I want to know if I am competitive enough for ECE MEng program. My CGPA on my submitted transcript is 3.82, and now my CGPA is 3.84 and I have updated it on SGS system (although ECE used their own web system as well, I could not update it on the system because I applied for MASc actually but checked for MEng option and submitted my application in mid-December). On my submitted CV, I listed my internship in a small company and two capstone projects in UofT, and some other course projects. During this winter, I secured a research opportunity in UofT and got an internship in a big tech company, but I can only explain this experience in the comment section in the web system (I left the comment before the ddl, and don't know if they will consider this). Is my background competitive for ECE MEng? (my interest field is software system)"
turxyu,0,2022-04-02,"You're not ""behind,"" you're on your own path and that's okay!",BrighterSpark,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/turxyu/youre_not_behind_youre_on_your_own_path_and_thats/,"Hi, I'm /u/BrighterSpark. I'm a graduating CS Major and I've been looking to engage a little more with this community, as I want to help clear up some misconceptions. It feels pretty common for CS students to feel alone, intimidated, and frustrated when they hear about all the success around them. You're not alone!

I'm prone to self-doubt, feeling isolated, and despairing due to the illusion that CS, and breaking into the industry at large, is harder than it looks. Out of every tip and trick, the most important part is to commit and know that you can do it

**Feeling ""behind"" is a common feeling, closely related to imposter syndrome, so I'd love for this subreddit to share some of their coming-from-behind stories, as that kind of encouragement would help inspire so many students!**

So, here's my story, shortish and sweet:

&gt;In high school, like a lot of people here, I was ""smart,"" but sad as hell. I was unmotivated and didn't have aims. My parents didn't go to college and I truly didn't have drive. I didn't see much reason to live, much less work hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cue college. I moved across the country, but still didn't feel it. I wrote my first line of code a month before turning 19 as part of a first-year engineering class. I found it neat, but didn't at all take to it like a storm. I was way too out-of-it for that. I took a job to help in IT for a local high school that summer  
&gt;  
&gt;I hated my major, so I swapped to something close to CS. I took more coding classes, and struggled to feel like I was getting anywhere (but I was). I had a major shift as the pandemic hit, and I committed to CS, but still struggled to get anywhere until getting medicated for ADHD. I suddenly could focus better, but didn't have the skills to follow through on working and studying.  
&gt;  
&gt;I applied like crazy to internships and took a terrible one after second year at a shitty insurance company. I generally did terribly  
&gt;  
&gt;I went into my third year and wrote more terrible code. I got a little better, leetcoded a bit, and applied like crazy to internships. I got one at a decent, but not great, tech company. That was last summer  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm still an anxious mess at times, but it's gotten so much better. I'm finally seeing that ""a mountain is just a mountain,"" and that my anxiety will never get me anywhere. I'm graduating next month with a 3.9gpa, kept up entirely because I've been thinking I'd fail out the *whole time*  
&gt;  
&gt;Recently, I've been pursuing a start-up idea and finally building some real apps. I've also accepted an offer with a good company (not FAANG) for happy compensation as a new grad (\~130k TC in MCOL) and I finally feel confident that my careers going somewhere. I'm mostly in disbelief, since I still feel behind and I still feel like I won't make it (even tho I'm on my way)

There's a lot more to my story, but I don't want to clog it up, as I'd love to see some other students (or recent grads) share their stories!!!

**TLDR:You're not ""behind,"" you're on your own path and that's okay!**

* **18: Depressed, self-harming, No motivation/drive. Start college**
* **19: Started learning code. Got medicated. Crappy summer job ($13/hr)**
* **20: Low-tier tech internship ($19/hr)**
* **21: Decent internship ($27/hr)**
* **22: Great full-time offer &amp; in disbelief (\~130k in MCOL)**

**Share your coming-from-behind success stories!!**"

I am a college student from India  currently in tier 1/2 engineering college obtaining a degree in the electronics and communication branch. I am in my second year and am confused on taking a path for my career. EIther I can go for a software dev profile and polish my skills towards that or focus on core branch and grab a job in this electronics field. Companies from both fields visit our college for placements and competition is a bit tough for CS jobs due to people from almost all branches applying for it,  
I tried my hand at web dev and practicing a bit of DSA but as soon as I entered into this world I just saw large number of people longing for a job here adding to the fact that undergraduates from all fields are just desprate to get into software dev due to handsome level of compensation they get.  
Even though I enjoy many aspects of programming I don't know why I am not able to overcome this hesitancy where I feel that going into this field will be like following herd mentality and 5-10years down the lane this field will be so saturated that i won't have enough room to grow as these skills will be standardised and wont be my USP anymore.  
Coming to the second choice of job in electronics, I feel that many things that we study in my current course matches that of CS but i don't really enjoy some core subjects like Analog Electronics. this simply does not imply that I hate electronics that's not the case but I believe i would enjoy building powerful software solutions for the world a bit more.But the competition in core sector (electronics market ) is relatively easy as we have to compete with ohter  branch students. We have companies like Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm coming to our campus for hiring and internships. I have no problems grinding hard for either branch but am not sure where i will receive the most for effort put in.  
 On discussion with some seniors they were split on opinion and defended their career choice as perfect, some pointed out the rapid rate at which the world is looking for software solutions for almost everything, others reminded me that computer science is being overhyped and you will witness an exponential growth in Indian electronics market and can have an awsome career there, pointing out to huge investment that govt is looking into electronics market and asked me to rethink about my career choices. I think they both were correct in their views and that has put me into scepticism that do I really love CS or am just going with the herd,everytime I am not able to solve a tough question on leetcode or in core subjects. My choice for software jobs would have been clear if I has despised the core branch but that's apparently not the case.  
It would be really great if you all experienced people out there  could guide me since I am thinking a lot about this and due to that i am not focusing on either one and that really hurts.  
P.S- I do feel that I would find great joy in building solutions for this society even if it meant leaving a job 5-6 years and trying to make something of my own when i have gained enough experience in the field.  
TLDR; fascinated by both Electronics and software dev fields.can't decide my career."

History teacher - probably 10/10, knew him for four years, was also the MUN advisor, we were pretty close

English teacher - 7/10, she liked me well enough, but I had her online, and I wasn't the top of my class

**Interviews**

Columbia - was 30 minutes, interviewer didn't seem interested in the conversation, cut me off and was clearly reading off of a list of questions, no bueno, also my first interview

Brandeis - Also short, but went well, nothing special

Harvard - 1 hour and 30 minutes, went really well, interviewer said he would push for me to be admitted (although I took this with a grain of salt)

Princeton - was OK, 45 minutes, was basically just a Q&amp;A about Princeton, he didn't ask me any questions besides the classic ""tell me about yourself""

Cornell - was purely informational, but the interviewer and I got along well

Penn - 1 hour, went really well, she seemed impressed with my achievements

**Essays**

I was told that my personal statement was good, but I don't think it made me stand out. 7/10. Some of my supplements were really good (Yale, Columbia), but for the most part they were average.

**Additional Information:**

I applied to the ivies for the lols, although I did feel like I wasted my ED. Either way, Emory was one of my top choices, so everything worked out for me in the end. I didn't want to apply to too many schools (due to fees, writing essays, etc.), but if I had to redo the process I would have applied to more T20s, or have applied ED2 to NYU (I didn't do this because of the crazy tuition)."

tuv9vl,3,2022-04-02,"Software Engineering Project, what should I put on Resume?",DependentAd1569,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/tuv9vl/software_engineering_project_what_should_i_put_on/,"Hey all,

Over the fall semester I worked on a project that was rolled over from the summer, it was just a professor and I working on a navigation system for a local company to implement into their maps, they have various projects going on around campus to get students involved. 

My question for you all today, I am looking to put it on my resume, but after reaching out to the company and asking if it’s okay to put co-op or internship they said they would steer clear of that, as it would imply it was paid(it wasn’t). 

I put months of work into the project and was looking to have it stand out on my resume in the experience section, not so much the project section. It was very coding heavy from scratch and we checked off all the requirements given to us. 

EXTRA INFO: 
Over the Summer I was the only paid student out of 5 for my work on the navigation system for the school itself, but it intrigued the company, and they wanted me to shift towards their navigation system, leaving the schools at a halt, and once summer was done, pay was gone and I spent the semester working for free in anticipation of having a solid foundation for my resume. The coding was a lot of C and JavaScript, and adding a GPS to show the location of user with a completely custom map similar to one you’d find in a BMW or Tesla. 

What would you put on your resume as far as position title? (My idea was Software Engineering Co-op)

Thank you!"

1. Author/blogger -- Self-published a book based off blog posts. Mainly focused on my own journey navigating mental health, toxic household, detailing experiences, etc. Over 90 posts &amp; 1300+ views. 
2. Speech and Debate -- President (12), Tournament Coordinator (11). One of the biggest clubs at our school (100+ members). Managed logistics (paperwork, spreadsheets, signups) &amp; communications with admin, parents, &amp; students. Did policy 9th and 10th, but quit. Love the team though so that's why I stayed to help with logistics. 
3. Piano -- I played piano for 12 years. Didn't really win anything. Went to a couple festivals. Got my ABRSM Grade 8 Certificate. (also forgot to add it on my UW app lolll) 
4. As-Am magazine -- Non-profit, high school run. Features Asian-American stories covering hate crimes, women’s history, sexuality. Featured on Seattle Times &amp; NPR. Quarterly issues.
5. Table tennis -- ""Champion of WA State Championship Women Singles – 2019. Champion of WA State Championship Junior Girls Singles – 2019, 2018, 2016."" Used to have a pretty big time commitment, but stopped playing due to Covid. Never picked it back up, mainly b/c I thought my title were fancy enough already and I wasn't really improving. 
6. Middle school debate coach -- Volunteered at an online middle school debate camp for a couple sessions. Graded some homework, gave lectures, etc. 
7. Summer camp -- Did a nonfiction &amp; journalism summer camp. Focused on profiles, op-eds, personal essays, features, and criticisms. Learned how to workshop essays. 
8. Policy debate -- Researched about immigration, arms sales, and criminal justice. Developed public speaking skills. Learned and exercised parts of argumentation.... Well, it was something I did for two years of high school, had to show where all my time went. Debate was really not my thing. 
9. Kumon -- Tutoring kids in math and English. Also helped with Junior Kumon (smaller kids), really practiced patience and enunciation. 
10. MUN -- (not involved in the club, hosted a conference for our class). Developed a historical curriculum surrounding Spanish American War. Graded more papers. 

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. AP Scholar with Distinction
2. IB Diploma Recipient 
3. ABRSM Piano Grade 8

**Letters of Recommendation**

English teacher (6/10) -- I had him for online because he went on paternity leave during the end of the year when we went back in-person. I didn't think he had a bad impression of me and I asked him to submit the rec he wrote for my summer camp. We had a couple interactions and that was it. 

Stats teacher (7/10) -- I had a couple more interactions with my stats teacher. I was one of the few non-seniors in his classes and I got the impression that he liked me. It was very awkward though because we only started interacting during the end of the school year. Plus, I'm a really quiet person. 

Counselor (5/10) -- I don't think this could've gone wrong b/c my school sends out a feedback form to other teachers to fill out. But I didn't know my counselor personally. 

Debate coach (9/10) -- Probably my best rec because he could speak to my personality the best. We had many conversations about just life in general and other debate related paperwork. One of my life's mentors I guess. 

**Interviews**

UMM I DIDN'T GET ANY INTERVIEWS :(( i think i was supposed to signup for some of them but either i wasn't paying enough attention or all the slots were taken or i submitted a video essay for brown and bowdoin

**Essays**

\~PS\~

I REALLY despised writing supplements because it was putting all the same essays in all different places, which was tiring, tedious, and boring.

Nonetheless, I loved writing my personal statement despite it draining my entire October's worth of vitality. 

I went through **TEN** versions of a personal statement, most of which I wrote for fun, and most of which felt like they didn't cover enough bases of my story. Most of them are decent essays that aren't good ""college essays."" 

Instead of doing a holistic approach of my ECs and tying them into one concept, I chose to just focus on creative writing. With my essays, I felt that I needed to prove that I'm a capable writer through my essays while other people are only trying to show their strengths/personality through their personal statement. 

The last version of my essay that I turned in is about how I found a form of communication (writing) through silence, a silence resulted from being rendered voiceless due to my parents and very scared to say anything on my mind. The essay delves deeper into just the cathartic release blogging gives me and talks about how writing is my method of empowering others and why that's important to me.

But with all my essays, I needed to make sure that I wasn't a giant red flag waving ""I have daddy issues."" 

Part of the struggle with my essays is that I'm sort of still figuring out what I want to do. I really haven't determined what career path it is I want to go into, but I figured it probably will involve turning writing into a career. 

My PS was kind of redundant with other supps. Even though I wanted to write about writing, I was gonna do that in other supps already. But at this point, I don't know what I'd write about instead. 

\~Supps\~

Community Essay -- I talked about members in my policy debate squad and trading words of compliments with them. During Covid, we were all separated during long weeks of debate camp, so I sent a nice note to someone new everyday. I thought it'd just be nice. 

Why Major -- Talked about the As-Am magazine I write for, focused more on advocacy work and how I articulate writing into activism. I liked the essay a lot, but I didn't think it fit ""why major"" well enough. I thought to myself, ""colleges are looking for someone who can give them something, so I should talk about what I'm going to bring them"" when the real reason ""why creative writing"" is sort of what my PS said already. My essay topics strat could've been a lot more diversified. 

Why School -- Very formulaic: what major, 1-2 classes, professor, clubs, minor

I think I could've made myself look stronger, but I'm a very down-to-earth and honest person. Being president of s&amp;d is definitely something really impressive, but I kind of went the logistics route. By November, I hadn't really done much yet b/c I was new, so I didn't write much. Probs should've edited it for January though.

I have been taught C++ and also have been doing some self studying. Right now I'm taking a course on Html and CSS ( I know they aren't programming languages but close enough) and I'm also slowly reading and practicing How to automate the boring stuff with Python. I should be done with my bachelor by May next year but I still don't know if I'm ready for a job or that if I will by May.

That's why I would like to know if an internship is worth a try and if I'm also ready for one. Is there some place I could get inform about them. I'm from Puerto Rico so I would like it to be remote but I don't know if it is possible. I don't even know if they pay or not, not that it matters, I'm just looking for experience"

1. Research: so like I did independent research the summers before junior and senior year; I had a mentor but like we met virtually and I had to do everything at home because of COVID. I did computational biology research so it was just coding and journal article reading at home.
2. Science Olympiad: been part of this cult since 7th grade 😎 I was just a participant but I led a couple events.
3. Art: I draw lol, I have an art instagram account with a whopping 90 followers
4. Violin: random violin and orchestra stuff; I do orchestra in school and sometimes qualify for all-county orchestra.
5. Math club: I compete in the math club competitions. Not that great at it; qualified for states one year and did abysmally lol
6. Violin tutored an elementary school kid for violin during COVID
7. Internship at a local art business one summer
8. Volunteered sporadically, especially for art events
9. Foreign language: I got a 650 streak on duolingo 😎 jk I didn't actually write that. I've been trying to learn Chinese and Japanese (and a some Korean) over the past few years. I coded an anki-style application to help me memorize characters (the app is no where near publication quality tho lol)
10. Figure Skating: I figure skate recreationally, started in high school

\*\*MIT only has spots for four ECs; I put research, science olympiad, art, and violin. I was able to put internship and violin tutoring in a different section.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. International research award
2. Regional research award
3. 9 regional Science Olympiad medals over the past few years
4. A couple regional art awards over the past few years
5. Mandarin Essay writing award

\*\*After I submitted all my applications, I also got another international research award, a regional research award, a state research award, and a regional art award. I sent these through application updates/emails

**Letters of Recommendation**

Honors Algebra 2 teacher (9/10): I asked her because my parents said that during parent teacher conferences she said that I'm nice and that I help others lol. She was my teacher in 10th grade, but I asked her since I was completely virtual during 11th grade. I did really well in her class, and I also do a lot of the math events in my school, so the letter was probably good. She's also really nice

AP English Language teacher (9/10): He was my teacher when I was completely virtual, but I tried to make an effort to talk to him through emails and office hours and stuff. He's really nice as well

Science Research teacher (9/10): I've known him for four years, and he's seen my entire research process. I work really hard during research class during the year and on my research over the summer, which he knows so his essay is probably good too

**Interviews**

I got interviews from MIT, Princeton, UPenn, Harvard, and Columbia. All my interviewers were really nice and the conversations were pretty good. My Princeton interviewer actually graduated from my high school a few years ago and our resumes are really similar, which she was kinda freaked out by lol. She was chill tho, and apparently she was supposed to write a full on essay about our interview lol

**Essays**

I spent a few months on my common app essay (july to sept I think). It was so brutal I don't think I could go through this process again omg. It was about me stepping out of my comfort zone to actually try figure skating and research because I thought I could never do either of them.

My other essays were generally about research, science olympiad, or art. I think my science olympiad essays were pretty good because our team had a whole underdog story arc lol.

Also interesting to note, my english teachers said my voice came through pretty good in my essays, and I think that personal vibe in my essays helped my application a lot

**Supplements**

Imma just add a supplement section here because I think they helped

* Maker Portfolio: cardboard dollhouse, crochet stuffed animals, chicken toy cosplaying Aqua from Konosuba, flying car costume; also anyone remember rainbow loom? I have like 50 3D rainbow loom things which I all submitted. Women in STEM 😎
* Art portfolio: Just some of my art pieces from high school and AP Art
* Research portfolio: my research paper. YO this supplement sucks (the MIT research portfolio specifically) there are soooo many questions any research students applying to MIT pls heed this warning

Submitted art, maker, research to MIT and Columbia; art to Brown, Princeton, Harvard, UPenn

I submitted my research paper anywhere I could

**Additional Information:**

Very very thankful for MIT giving this silly goose a chance 🙏🙏🙏. Research probably carried lol. None of the research awards I got ""guaranteed"" me for top schools (I wasn't STS top 40 or an ISEF winner), but I was pretty passionate about my research and had a good story behind it. And to think I almost didn't do research lol.

But honestly besides research and science olympiad, my other ECs weren't that great (low impact, low commitment but to be fair this is because I spent like every moment on research or science olympiad lol). This makes me think that my essays helped, especially my ""voice"" in them lol. I also think my teacher recs were good too.

Also getting into MIT is surprising because I did not take the hardest courses in my school. I could've taken APUSH and AP Gov/AP Euro but after AP World I just couldn't with history anymore lol. I ended up taking regular-level social studies classes (there weren't any honors classes for them). Also I wish I could've taken AP Chemistry but alas I had no room in my schedule. I got very lucky lol

ALSO TO ANYONE WHO IS ON THE FENCE ABOUT CMU ED: I actually applied to CMU ED2, but I changed my mind soon after I submitted (I had been debating this for a very long time). I just wanna say that it is possible to switch out of CMU ED2 **IF** you email their admissions office *very soon* after the the application deadline (and you gotta be fast because they release decisions on Feb 1). If they make a decision before you notify them, then you gotta stay in. I switched over to RD one week after I submitted. I just wanted to say this because I couldn't find anyone who was actually able to switch out of ED2 on google or reddit lol"

Till now I have been working on some old projects and gathering a lot of documentation. This got me used to almost all their internal software, and my supervisor is giving me a chance to take lead in the electrical portion of a semi capital upgrade. I am 100% stoked for this and i will try my best to learn as much as I can. During my documentation days I would try to shadow other engineers and see how they progress projects. It definitely helped. My team is very helpful, but I always have a feeling that if I am with them I am just slowing them down, and I don't want to get anyone in trouble. Also, whenever I approach my team, they would kinda drop their work and sort mine out which makes me sorta feel guilty. Everyone seems very busy with their tasks. I would sometimes interject and try to help them, and learn somethings along the way

I was wondering if I was going about this the right way, or if I should do something else. What would you guys want from a returning intern for a full time position? What skills would you like to see, and perhaps how to go about getting those skills?"

Hey everyone!!

I'm a current high school student studying in Singapore about to go to university in the US (on an F-1 visa) and I have 2 options. The first is to take CS at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the second is to take the Cybersecurity major at Purdue. I already have Security+. 

I've been through the course catalogs and UMass seems to have a standard cs catalog, while Purdue has many courses like Unix administration, Unix fundamentals, and Incident Response Management which seem to be self learnable.

Purdue costs about 20000 USD more than UMass for me.

My eventual goal is to get a job in cybersecurity.

My questions are
1. Recruitment wise would a student with a cybersecurity degree vs a student with a cs degree but certs like sec+ would have an advantage? Assuming that technical interview ability is the same.
2. The cybersecurity major at purdue is in the west Lafayette campus but is housed in the polytechnic institute, and based on what I've seen doesn't share faculty with the cs department. So I can't use rankings to decide. Would the polytechnic reputation put me at a disadvantage?
3. Internship opportunities seem to better at Purdue than UMass but I'm not sure, can anyone who know confirm?
4. Finally, which one would you guys reccomend Purdue Cybersecurity or UMass Amherst CS?

Thanks for taking the time to read the long post 

TL;DR: UMass Amherst CS vs Purdue Cybersecurity?"

In my 6-month program, I did IT audit tasks for banks &amp; manufacturing (mostly ITGC because my major wasn't finance/accounting), as well as in charge as a PMO in a telco data management project (tracking documents, translating, writing MoM and some other tasks). After the internship I tend to move to a HCOL city for the master degree, where the staff salary can hardly be enough for a living (monthly spent in average is approx. $350-400 while the monthly received is around $400).

Before KPMG I've already done some fulltime jobs as a fresher data analyst for banking and logistics service (SQL + Excel). I also find the IT Advisory path interesting and want to explore more, and according to my PMs suggestion, I can go and work for risk department on banking sector. However I find a bit unsure, as I've mentioned before, that I don't major in finance/accounting. 

And is there any other job on the Advisory path that would suit me?

I would love to hear more advice from you guys, especially who live and work in SEA region.

I can't really rate them because I haven't read them, but I'll describe my relationship with the teachers that wrote them.

Calculus teacher: we are pretty close, I talk w/ almost everyday; very popular teacher with a great sense of humor

Chemistry teacher: also pretty close, I might be one of their favorite students because they have very little IB chemistry kids

French teacher: also pretty close, one of the few to skip a level to go into a higher level class

Orchestra teacher: I think they really like me--they asked to write me a recommendation and told me it is a very good one, I asked them to submit to Yale, Penn, and Northwestern

**Interviews**

Not going to rate them because I don't know what a good interview looks like

Georgetown: ​we talked about things I like, it was a pretty chill conversation but nothing too special

Yale: we also talked about things I like and my school environment. He asked me about my background as an immigrant and we had a discussion about my childhood and Asian politics. He is a great person &amp; comforted me after my rejection :"")

**Essays**

I do not know how good my essays are--all I know is that my mind was not in the right place back when I was writing them and in my opinion they are super mediocre... may have been what made my app bad.​ My common app essay (in my opinion) was really not that good, probably didn't tell much about myself.

I am definitely not a bad writer though, I am an IB candidate so I do a bunch of writing.

**Reflection:**

I've always wanted to attend an East Coast private but I guess things don't always work out; transferring after a year or two is always an option though. I am super-duper (x10) grateful for UCLA, USC, and Cal because those are dream schools for many, but I sometimes question how validating those acceptances are because some really questionable people from my school have gotten in.

I often have doubts about whether I really reached my full potential. These few days I've been beating myself up for not working harder during apps season but I guess that won't bring me anywhere. There were factors outside my control such as how I had been battling depression starting way back before senior year started.

I would really love to discuss with y'all about whether you think there's anything that seemed like red flags on my apps, etc. because these few days I've been really confused and sad about my results--I was hoping I could get at least a private but I was met with rejection after rejection, to the point I questioned whether I even deserved to get into UCLA, Cal, and USC."

tv564t,0,2022-04-03,Stuck at a point.,Straight_Entrance_44,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tv564t/stuck_at_a_point/,"Hey everyone, I hope ya'll are doing great. I am stuck at a point and I thought why don't I ask it on this sub, I'm a Computer Science undergrad, currently in my second year. During the first semester, we learned python, it was pretty easy as far as the concepts were taught and the projects we made, and I became connected to it very well. From the second semester, we were taught data structures and algorithms, oops, etc thus the professors shifted towards C++ and Java and the reason you know very well. I managed to do good but not great in those courses, but now comes the hurdle. 

Currently, we're studying algorithm designs and it exposed my programming knowledge very well. It's just like we're shifted from skating to surfing, sometimes I understand the concepts and the logic behind it during the lectures, and sometimes it feels like gosh why didn't I approach it like that ?? Side by side I'm working on some python projects as well, thus switching the languages sometimes bugs me, like I completely forget how to input space-separated integers from the console in java and I've to google it again! Our professors as particularly don't focus on teaching a language, they did it in the first semester but after that, it's all self-learning, we only learn about the course like how to implement oops or algo in it, but what if we're struggling at it fundamentally. I'm not saying I'm naive, I learn and then I forget, plus the fact that debugging a java/C++ code is a lot more work than debugging a python program. Till the last semester and also this one, I write down notes, that I learn in the lectures and sometimes the video tutorials too, but I think most of the knowledge we grab is from the errors we search for(stack overflow), but I don't write that down ( should I ? ).

 On the theoretical part, I understand the concepts, but when we're given assignments with questions different from what I learned in the lectures, I get stuck. I think I need to practice more and more on the ""implementing part"" and that could only solve the problem. I've to prepare for the internship interviews as well, so I need to be better at DSA and algo designs, am a lil bit afraid cause seeing my peers doing great, I feel I won't be able to get one though I'm capable of doing it. I'm doing great in the other courses, and for a matter of fact my maths is good ( I scored 8+ pointers out of 10 in all 3 MTH courses I've taken so far, and the irony here is, my friends who're great in CP and algos are VERY VERY AVERAGE in maths considering the stigma that all great programmers are good mathematicians).

 A little insight about them, our first year was completely online just like other colleges around the world, so they did pretty well in other courses as well cause you know how online semester works. Now as all the current courses have pre-requisites from the first year, they are thrashed in the current offline semester and looking for someone to teach them starting from the basics. Speaking of my progress, I relied on myself only since day one, thus did average in all courses, now am relaxed about the other courses and stressed about the algo designs only. Yesterday we were given 3 questions to do on codeforces but I wasn't able to solve even one of them. And the fact that algos are just implementing maths cleverly bugs me, I think I can do it but I'm unable to. 

There's another problem I think homies that are currently in college can relate to, during the online semesters we knew nothing about our progress, being stuck at home and attending online lectures, doing assignments and projects taught us nothing about the competition, AND NOW, when the college reopened just a few months ago, seeing all the other kids doing several things, crushes the confidence as if I did nothing during the last two years. My friends come to me when they're struggling with maths and I help them out, but I don't approach anyone to get a question of programming solved cause I think that way I'll learn nothing. I've to revise oops and DSA as well as I told about the internship earlier. There's a lot to talk about, and I don't think this way I'm gonna stop writing. I hope I made myself clear, though I know what I wrote is just pretty messed up, but that's exactly how life is going on. There are hundreds of peeps like me who can relate to this, the problem is tangled but someone with experience can shed some light to get out of it. I read FAQs as well, but I don't think I can find my personal problems in them.

Edit: A few people are confused about what I wanna ask, and as I stated earlier I'm confused as hell that's why I wrote everything so that you can identify what am I doing wrong, though I would love to hear the general perspective about Java/C++ and python as well, but my question is, how can I get better in algorithms ( I don't wanna hear the usual answer ie practice on some problems, have this been the problem I would've solved that already). I need some insights into your personal experience about your journey in CP or algos. in general, cause I know people might've been on the same lane at a point in their life. I wanna hear from some experienced once, I know I have the ability to do great in it, your words can get me on the right path.

And yeah don't you dare to think I prefer python over Java or C++ or it's something like being limited to a box, I know the pros-cons, I love all of them :p

tv7jmx,7,2022-04-03,My GF(22) with major trust issues because of past traumas doesn't think she can trust me (25M) anymore and probably wants to break up with me,nate_saaber,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tv7jmx/my_gf22_with_major_trust_issues_because_of_past/,"Me and my GF have been colleagues for 4 years now. Nothing much happened in the first few years, but since the end of 2020, we'd start texting each all the time and having a fun time at work. Late last year, I realized she and I probably had serious feelings for each other and I asked her out a few times, which were always a blast and I even spent NYE with her and her mother and sister, which was the most fun and best time I've ever had on NYE. A week later in early January, I confessed my feelings to her and she confessed she felt the same, so we've been officially together for 3 months now.

Honestly, there hasn't been a single time that we've spent together that wasn't fun or just straight up amazing. I love her with all my heart, I have for a long time and I really know she feels the same way, but right now, those feelings are conflicted on her side.

Over the last 6 or so months, I've learnt a lot about her past. Without going into detail, there are many good reasons from her past why she's now mentally really strong, independent and.. has major trust issues. Basically; abusive dad, mother's abusive boyfriends after divorce, her own past 2 relationships that ended bad because of the guys being mentally abusive and most of their own family abandoning them for no good reason. Because of all this, it's been just the 3 of them for a long time now with never a good man being able to find a way into their lives.

So what happened 2 days ago is this;

I'm bi. It's not a 50/50 split, but more of a 80/20 split with more interest in women. I also never dated a man nor do I have interest in it. How do I know I'm bi then? Honestly, I just feel like I am. Maybe I'm wrong and I'm still confused, but that's besides the point. This is a fact about myself I've never told her apparently. Honestly, she has no issues with the LGBTQ+ community and fully supports it, so let's forget about that. So 2 days ago, a friend of her mom was over at their place while I was there too and he made some homophobic jokes which turned into homophobic remarks. This made me uncomfortable, so I stepped out of the room and went upstairs. That's when I first realized I never told her that I'm bi and so I decided then and there that I would tell her the same day. Luckily, she came upstairs looking for me and asked me what was wrong, so I she sat beside me and I told her those jokes bothered me and that I'm bi. So within about 10 minutes of realizing I never told her, I ended up telling her. Despite it being a part of me I've tried to not think about for a long time and I guess kinda repressed it, I have no problem admitting that I am bi.

She seemed a little, I don't want to say shocked, but surprised and didn't really know what to say. We talked for about a minute before her little sister came upstairs to bring us downstairs for dinner, so I said we should continue talking about this later. Honestly didn't expect it to be that big of a deal at that point, because I knew she wouldn't mind the fact that I was bi. When we came downstairs, it was just the 4 of us. Her mom, sister, her and myself. A few minutes later I asked if we could talk somewhere in a bit and she said she wanted to go outside to walk around for a bit, which was fine by me, but her mom noticed something was up and wouldn't let her go. My gf refused to say what it was, because it wasn't up to her to talk about it, so after a minute of silence, I told the rest of what it is that I told her moments prior. None of them mind the fact that I'm bi, I know that, but because of what they all went through multiple times in the past, I can't blame them for being shocked at this revelation. My gf still didn't know what to say, she wasn't mad, just reliving some stuff from the past, so it was mostly me and her mom who did the talking. Her mom, who's very lovely and was super fond of me, made it clear that this was going to bring up a lot of traumas from my gf's past. Things she's yet to deal with, because I know she's been repressing most of it instead of dealing with it in a healthier way. And besides all the past traumas, she's been dealing with a burnout from the unreasonable amount of work school is giving her, her internship, her regular job, her family is not doing great financially and her car broke down recently, she might need to get minor surgery on her arm because it's been hurting non-stop for the past month - Basically, things haven't been going great for her.. ever.

I started this relationship on thin ice. Not because of me, but of what others did in the past. I knew that and I've tried my best to respect that. When they asked me why I haven't told her sooner, I couldn't give them a better answer than ""I genuinely haven't thought about my sexuality in a long time"". As far as I remember, that afternoon was the first time I thought about it in many months and when I realized I hadn't told her yet, I told her straight away. My own mother wondered why I even said it at all if I'm together with a girl and honestly, since I kinda repress it anyway, it would've been easier to never tell her about it anyway, but honesty is important to me as well, so I wouldn't want to hide it from her. So after about 30 minutes of talking, I decided to go home and give her the space to think.

I felt awful. The entire bus ride home I was staring at my phone, waiting for a text or anything. The moment I got home at about 6pm, I went straight to bed, staring at my phone for the next 6 hours, hoping for a text, but got nothing. So I eventually fell asleep as I had to get up early for work the next day. My gf had to work as well, so I hoped we could talk about it at work. I went to her place and waited in front of the house like I always do, but eventually got a text from her, the only one I got since I left the day before saying ""I'm not coming into work today"". I was devastated, but went on my way to work as I was already running 20 minutes late. The whole day I felt awful, couldn't focus on work, constantly checking my phone, until about 4pm when I got a message saying that she wasn't hurt by the fact that I'm bi, but that I hadn't told her sooner. That trust is an important thing to her and that looking back at the past, she doesn't want to take anymore risks. Ending it with that when we do work together again, it can be ""normal and professional"".

I was in the back by myself and I broke down. I replied saying what I feel for her and that I regret not telling her sooner - that I would've if I had just thought about it sooner and that all I want to ask for is a face to face conversation before any decisions are made final. She replied later that she needs to find peace in her head before she wants to talk in person, which I respect, so I'll give her that space.

This was yesterday and I haven't heard from her since. It sounds like it's over, but what we have/had was real. I'd be typing for days if I wanted to explain how sure I am about that, but we love each other, I know that. She's afraid that things from the past will repeat themselves so she doesn't want to take any risks by isolating herself again. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but good people can make mistakes. It was a dumb mistake, but it wasn't intentional, nor would I ever do anything to hurt her intentionally. I just hope she realizes that before she makes any final decision..

I genuinely do not believe that the bisexual part is the issue. She's a full supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. Though she has barely said anything since I told her, she's brought it up twice that it doesn't matter who I am, but that it hurts that I didn't tell her sooner. Making her feel as if I didn't trust her with that information in a way.

This outcome of where our relationship is at now would've probably happened as well with anything else that should've been said sooner as it's a matter of trust, and not about my sexuality. As I've already explained to her; that 20% is there, but I have no desire to do anything with it. The reason why it probably never came to mind to tell her is because, as cliché as it sounds, I haven't been thinking about anyone else since I fell in love with her. No other woman, or man for that matter.

I wrote a long letter detailing my explanation and what I feel for her. I think it would help see things in a different light, but I promised I would give her some space first, so I'm unsure when to send it to her or if I should wait till we're talking in person and read it to her, though I feel like we won't talk till she's made her mind up, and right now, it's not looking good.

I care more about her than anyone or anything in the world. I would genuinely give my life for her.

**TL;DR**

**My GF has went through A LOT in the past. Like, way too much and bad things are still happening. I never mentioned the fact that I'm bi, but the moment I remembered she didn't know, I told her straight away 10 minutes later. She doesn't mind that I'm bi, she's upset and now reliving past traumas because I didn't tell her sooner. It's honestly my mistake. I should've told her sooner, but as stupid as it sounds, it just never came to mind. Now she's isolating herself and probably wants to break up to avoid getting hurt in the same way she's been hurt way too many times in the past by people lying and deceiving her.**

I'm very tired, so my apologies for any typos or the way this whole thing is written.

Thank you for reading, though I don't even know what to ask of you, so.. thoughts?

Should I just wait it out as she wanted space to think or should I do something (like send that letter) before she's made her mind up?"

******

The car was an American design, but beefed up. Unlike the Security Forces up-armored technicals, this had the armor plating on the inside, just beneath the plush padded interior, with Shil’ tempered transparent material and a layer of tinting along the outside to maintain privacy. A whole fleet of the vehicles had been built by a coachworks out of Ohio, their engines stripped out and rebuilt to be electrical.

In many ways, the design mirrored the Shil’ themselves, he reflected, staring up at his driver. Armored, with an appealingly familiar shape, and a tough and powerful build, *but oh so very soft and warm on the inside*. But it was strictly something physical between the two of them, and he held no illusions about that. ‘Clarissa,’ as he’d taken to calling her instead of her nigh unpronounceable Shil' name, was fiercely loyal to the Empire, *but she was still a woman*.

The armored personnel carriers, though, with their rougher edges, were an unwelcome addition to his morning commute- and Clarissa had refused to position their car anywhere but the dead center of the formation.

The APCs that made up their convoy ground to a halt in unison- and the congressman stared ahead in awe as nearest APC swung its rear hatch open, and a woman in extremely ornate armor stepped out. The design was one part Gothic Revival, one part retro-futuristic, and he was reminded of some of his nephew’s painted figurines. The lone marine cut an impressive figure as she stalked toward the car.

“Clarissa- what’s”

The door locks gave a solid *click* and the Marine yanked open the door with all the patience of a vengeful demon. Clarissa didn’t say or do anything at all, vehicle remaining stationary. Despite the powerful air conditioning, he felt himself break out in a sweat.

“Hey- what!?” Clarissa ignored his shocked protestations and continued to stare straight out the windshield, and the vehicle’s suspension shifted under the strain of the Marine and her intricately decorated armor. As she took her helmet off, he immediately recognized her by her shockingly pure white hair, and the distinctive scar over her left cheekbone.

There was no questioning who this was, or why she was here. “A-Azraea,” he said, turning to face the state’s reclusive alien Governess-General.

“We have treated you well, Senator.” She dispensed with the introductions. He didn’t feel like this was the time to correct her on the distinction between House and Senate.

“Yes. My daughter’s schooling…” he trailed off, swallowing as she leaned in. She had a knife on her hip, the scabbard dragging across before digging deep into the leather as she came near, but as he glanced back up at her, those fierce eyes were sharply focused only on him.

He didn’t need whatever this was. He’d been stressed beyond all reason, and the ‘protection’ they’d again promised, had proved anemic months ago. It hadn’t amounted to saving the life of so much as a single Senator or Congressman. The sole effectual representative of Shil’ authority on the night of terror had been a human-crewed armored pickup, which had folded in on itself from a single shot. If the terrorists had wanted to on that night, they could have emptied the entire Capitol of its elected representatives, and the Shil’vati could have done nothing about it.

But that was the previous pair of officials- a self-promoting Governess and an incompetent General. Azraea was another beast entirely, and the armies she’d brought down with her from orbit were testament to just how seriously they were taking this situation.

But sending Azraea here herself, with these APCs, didn’t reassure him that everything was going swimmingly, either, merely the scale of the threat that these terrorists posed in their eyes.

Of course, this show of force was just the latest in their attempts to budge the state's legislative branch. They’d allowed generous raises for the Congress, even some under-the-table ‘performance bonuses.’ While Congressman Castle now had money to show for his work, despite the millions, it *still* wasn’t enough to grease the right Shil’ palms to get the family off-planet. Not with a wife and daughter in tow- and he hadn’t yet managed to leverage his cooperation into a position off-planet where he could maintain any sort of lifestyle for them once off world. Not yet, anyways.

“That’s not all I’ve ordered sent your way.” Her eyes darted to the driver, who for her part didn’t so much as flinch. “Of course, if you let us down, well, we’ll just have to find another. Perhaps as a mercy to my troops, someone younger, with more vigor.”

“The uh, money, it’s been good. I- I’ll do what- I’m…I’ve been…” for the first time in his life, words failed him. Azraea had just made it clear what his night with Clarissa had been. He began trying to tally everything in his head, feeling the mental walls of his life crumble down. If he sold everything- then maybe…no. Then what- a life in space, with nothing to his name? No leverage, nothing to offer to sustain that life but his weathered old body? His wife couldn’t even fumble her way past a formal greeting in Trade Shil’, and had never worked a day in her life.

No, there was only *one* way out of this trap.

“I am just here to remind you of your task today. That you *will* deliver the hoped-for results.” Those eyes lined with crow’s feet bored holes through his soul. He didn’t remember the rest of what she said- he couldn’t hear her. Something *snapped* in his mind.

When he came back to his senses, he realized she was gone and the vehicle was in motion again, and back in position with the convoy, the dull green scenery from the summer's drought shifting around him. The tinnitus faded from a sharp tone into a faint hiss that intermittently crashed down, and then receded softly with his hard breathing.

The convoy rolled ahead without them at one of the intersections, and then they were a lone car, rolling down the road to Dover.

He heard it, then- some kind of buzzing, faint in the quiet cabin, through a lull in the hissing pattern of his sudden bout of tinnitus.

Clarissa said something back in Shil’, and then suddenly gripped the wheel tight and gave it a jerk to the right, the inertial dampeners doing their work and keeping him from being outright pinned against the vehicle’s plush walled interior as the vehicle careened around the corner, squealing tires audible even through the significant sound insulation and armor.

For a moment, some part of him thought that Clarissa had a strange sense of timing for when she’d pin him against the wall, or against the side of the car along a remote stretch of road- but the part of his brain that was still recovering from his stupor gave him a sharp slap of reality- that that was something which had *never* been.

“What are you doing?” He asked her. She held a hand up, eyes scanning the shoulder warily.

“There’s been a change of plans,” Clarissa said stiffly through her translator. “We’re altering the route.”

They wouldn’t do that unless there was a credible threat. 

They’d found out. Somehow, some way, they’d found out, and now his whole family was a target.

“What happened?”

“Nothing. Everything is under control.”

One didn’t last in politics unless they could sniff out a lie in a dozen different ways, and this one certainly reeked.

They rode past the next intersection in silence. Then the intersection after that one, which were the normal routes to the capitol.

At last, mercifully, they took the final intersection which led to Dover instead of the Military Garrison, the Court Street entrance- though at enough speed to break the illusion that this was a normal car as the driver tried to fake like she was going to continue straight, then turning the wheel only at the last second and at full speed, tires screaming. The Congressman managed to brace himself slightly this time, but still found himself almost pinned against the near door and one hand floundering for purchase eventually found the headrest so he could pull himself upright.

He gripped his fists tight as they rolled over the bridge- but there weren’t any explosions, and nothing dropped them into the water.

The State Congressman let out an audible sigh of relief as they made it across the creek.

The rebuilt state capitol loomed ahead, no longer familiar in design or material, and it was growing less so every yard the car brought them closer. The new bulbous purple dome sitting atop the Federal-style architecture of what remained of the original building sat atop it, like a bloated pustule.

His driver didn’t bring the car around to the front steps and let him walk from the usual drop-off spot, instead, stopping short around the side of the building. The doors remained locked as Shil’ swarmed his vehicle until he had a certifiable phalanx around him. 

Clarissa rolled down her window to receive a thick bundle of metal slats. 

“Take this,” she said simply.

It was Security Forces armor- bulky and ugly, all hard edges and dark brown metallic paint, being passed through the window by a guard, and then dumped over the center console into the back seat by Clarissa.

“Are- you-?”

She just glared at him, “Move.”

He strapped it on as best he was able.”The buckles- they’re too small-” he tried to force them to connect, and then grunted in effort.

“You’re too big,” she hissed.

A guard leaned in to examine what the delay was, before commenting. “Just leave them that way, and hold the pants up and walk unless we tell you to run. Hurry.”

A shadow fell over the capitol- he thought it was a cloud until he realized the ‘cloud’ wasn’t moving, and the only shade he’d seen all day was from the freshly planted trees around the capitol. He pressed a palm against the glass and leaned close, staring up through it, and ignoring the shapely form of the Marines now waiting impatiently outside of the vehicle. He almost dropped the damned metal pants as he saw it - a mean-looking spacecraft, bristling with weapons along its edges, which all twitched and jerked in random directions at unseen, potential threats.

This would be his life, now.

The door was opened for him after a heavy *clank* of the lock disengaging. “Have a lovely day, Congressman.”

He stood and took a few stumbling steps forward, then craned his neck up to gawk at the spaceship.

Instead of being given the time, he was nudged from behind and forced to keep pace with his guards as they marched him toward a side-door in one of the original sections which still stood. There, a Marine scanned the fields, looking past him until he was pushed past the door with the paint scraped off near the latch with all the dignity of a child being ushered away from something they didn’t understand was dangerous to be around.

Guards peeled away as they went further and further inside, fanning out and marking each section as ‘secure,’ meeting additional troops who were giving silent signals at every turn, until he was down to just a pair of guards, one of whom waited with him in the hall and held him back by his lapel, scanning the halls, while the other went inside and pushed out his secretary, Jen, while the Marine finished her sweep of his office.

She must have given an ‘all clear’ signal, because she then turned on her heel and said simply ‘good luck,’ in heavily accented English, and then marched away, leaving the lone guard at her post in the hallway.

Other Senators and Representatives began arriving in similar ill-fitting armor to their offices adjacent to his, some of them glaring daggers at him down the rebuilt hallway, with the smell of fresh plaster still hanging in the air a pungent reminder of what had happened before, and the risk he was now taking.

He could think about it later; for now, he had work to do.

“Do you have the speech?” He asked Jen, who was still flustered from being literally lifted off the ground and carried outside.

“I do.” She handed it over. “Ah, sir, about my appointment to the Federal-”

He waved a hand. “I sent the email in this morning. It was accepted. You’ll be promoted in a week to the offices on Market Street in Wilmington.”

She seemed relieved, as if the toll she’d paid and services she’d performed weren’t for naught.

“Can you bring me a coffee?”

“At once. From across the street?” 

He handed her his credit card and nodded, “I think I need one.” 

His heart was hammering in his chest, but he craved the familiarity. He closed the door behind him and started kicking the armor off of him when the phone rang and he jumped, then stared at the phone on his desk as it rang again, red light flashing.

“Congressman Cast-”

The voice, deep with a shallow rasp hissing on the other end of the line, interrupted him. “We’re watching. Remember that.”

The line went dead immediately. He opened the door to his office. “I just got a call. Did- can- who’s monitoring the phones? Who’s manning the lines in?”

“It’s an automated system. We’ll find out who called,” the marine said reassuringly. But the congressman knew that there hadn’t been any progress in apprehending the Emperor, or his various minions. The precautions today, the abilities they now had- the balance of power was shifting, but he was the one under the gun. If he double-crossed the Governess-General, well…things would be even worse for him.

His secretary come back only a couple minutes later, a bright smile on her face falling at his expression, steaming coffee in hand. “Is there something wrong?”

“No,” he lied, reaching for the caffeine, even though he wasn’t sure that anything could reassure him at this point, not even this pretence of familiarity. “One last favor. Bring my car around. The one I keep at home.”

“Sir? Who will then retrieve *my* car, if I drive there?”

He dug into his wallet, thick with bills- and then thought the better of it. He might need cash. “I’ll transfer you enough for a cab.”

The intern bustled from the office, short pencil skirt with the slit up the side having had a noticeable repair, and a fresh pair of stockings. She wasn’t stupid, he knew. She knew well who it was that buttered her toast.

A lesson he needed to remind the Congress.

He grabbed the speech off the desk and strode out to the legislative chambers.

He could barely hear his colleague calling his name– he felt the waddle of his steps like the gentle swaying of a canoe in the backwater marshes. Only when fellow representative Burroughs grabbed him by the shoulder did he turn- and when the man spoke, all he heard were the lapping of small cresting waves in the Chesapeake Bay, the sound of the wind rushing through the stacked crab pots, the rustle of cat’s tail reeds as they swayed when his coarse fabric dress jacket slid over his fine-thread dress shirt.

“Sorry,” he said, scratching at his ears and blinking as he tried to come back to his senses. “Again?”

“I said-” and he looked over his shoulder. “*Are you sure- are you certain- that they’ve changed sides?”*

“Oh, yes, absolutely. They’ll oppose the vote. You’re being counted on to vote ‘yes,’ so that it doesn’t fail by *too* wide a margin.” He lied through his teeth, fighting to keep them from clattering in fear, to keep his knees from quaking. His daughter. His wife. Had he saved, or damned them? Was there any move left to him, but to go through with it? “You haven’t given any rhetoric one way or another, right?” 

The man shook his head, and Congressman Castle clapped him on the shoulder and moved along.

He took the papers and slapped them down onto the podium he took, shouting for order, even though he could hardly hear his own words for the heartbeat thrumming in his ear.

“Gentlemen, we are at a crossroads in history. Democracy does not brook cowards who slink in shadow. We must stand tall and proud, and deliver this bill.” He gazed around the room at the numerous faces, from the two Shil’ Stalwarts on one side who stood nearest to him on the left, to the pair of backers on the right, backs leaned against the far wall, sneering down at him. They were those who he was sure thought the bill would get nowhere.

“If we are ineffective at governance and prove incapable of passing bills, then we cede the power of the state to terrorists. Therefore, we shall vote.” In secret, per new rules to protect one another. 

But that could be manipulated.

If the determination was to keep any controversial bills from passing, though *just barely* so as to not incur the wrath of the Shil’vati, then all he had to do was lie about who was aligned where, and foment mistrust. They could *try* and sort it out amongst themselves, but they could no more trust one another than they could trust him. They’d all been lying about the source of the holdups, the blame shifting every time, and never with any concrete evidence to back it, thanks to the anonymous nature of calling the votes.

The political realignment was still taking shape. While ostensibly the two parties still openly fought only to prove fealty, within the state of Delaware both Republicans and Democrats had members testing the waters of vocally supporting the insurgency, or even criticizing the empire in milder terms. Some were tempering their onetime fervorous support. There was no policy or precedent for party expulsion, and the more pro-Empire stalwarts were now finding themselves flanked by announcements from outsiders’ intention to primary them. All this was causing an internal civil war in both parties, and making strange bedfellows in the halls of the state congress. There were even whispers from the Federal Senators and sole Representative that not all was well within the party.

All this was causing no small amount of stress for him, since it was *his* responsibility to try and explain the outcome of bills to the Shil’vati government, and name who he suspected the likely holdup or obstruction, though with the anonymous voting, it was a guess at best.

As the votes were tallied, again, his thoughts drifted- and the uproar bled together until all he heard was the ocean.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**A Month Later:**

A hard day’s work. A relieving day’s work. This would feed people; help them. It felt good to know what he’d done was for the good of all.

His blood had roared in his ear like the ocean waves for hours, finally calming only when he saw the echoing, the distant silver moonrise’s reflection shifting over the ocean’s shifting and churn.

But it was…quiet. Peaceful.

The onetime Congressman Castle had been here for some time. Not so long as to forget everything, but long enough to find peace, to put the past behind him. To get into the rhythm of his new life.

Even he lost the count of days and felt none the lesser for having done so, no greater the fool. There were good days and bad ones. Wet ones and dry ones, nothing more and nothing less, for they were what mattered more than the name of the day he was given.

He didn’t run when he saw the car parked in the driveway of the old cabin as he paddled ashore, nor wave in greeting at the man standing and waiting for him at the docks, arms crossed over each other, hands at the waist and seemingly itchy to pull up his jacket.

“I’m not a Congressman, anymore.” He said simply by way of greeting, tugging the canoe the rest of the way ashore, and starting the process of transferring his catches.

“That wasn’t in the terms you agreed to.”

“Too bad,” he shrugged. “I’m a simple man, now. An oyster farmer, crab fisher, and all around boatman. Whether the bill passes or fails in the Senate- it’ll do it without me, without my input. But, you’re here, so I’m going to guess it passed.”

The man said nothing for a few seconds.

“You can’t be allowed to live.”

“Or what, the senators will pass a vote and then all quit?” He laughed. “The reward the Shil’ promised wasn’t this, I promise that much. They promised the stars, artificial joys and pleasures that would tempt anyone. But…” he turned back away from the man with the gun. “But it isn’t *this*.”

Yes, it was silty muck, but it was real, and true. Even though it was still infested with mosquitos despite best efforts to plead for their removal as \`\`non-essential to the food chain’ - the Shil’ hadn’t acquiesced. *Perhaps that’s leadership*, he mused.

The stranger didn’t answer.

“I passed on their reward.” He shrugged. “You won’t see me again- not as a politician, and I’ll do my best to stay hidden- out of the public light. Not even my family knows I’m here. I’ve…lost everything, and yet, I’m a more complete man than I ever knew I could be.”

“What of your family? Don’t you care?”

“Frankly? I think… I was lying to myself when I said I was doing it for them. They don’t know I’m here.” He shrugged. “They’ve been as uninvolved in the bill as I am now.” He took out the last trap. He still hadn’t quite gotten the hang of the work. A few vacation days here and there in the summer didn’t make him a tradesman, and soft, fat, calcified fingers had formed blisters from the paddling, and weren’t adept. He wasn’t cut out for the work. But he didn’t shy away from it. Not once did he wince, never did he complain. His plain, seawater-stained undershirt was the only clothing he had left from his time in office.

“What do I look like? An idiot?”

“What does *who* look like?” He said, not turning around to face the assassin. When he didn’t get an answer, but heard the rustle of fabric, he sighed. “For what it’s worth, it wasn’t worth it. The disappearances of friends. The selling of my soul. The politics. The stress. The work. The empty hope of prestige. The promises. The rewards I took for myself…I may have taken away the opportunity for my daughter to know as much as she possibly could, to learn more, but…perhaps ambition, convincing ourselves that there’s more to the world than this, is the root of all our misery, all our cruelty.”

He never heard the gunshot that killed him, or the whispered answer that followed.

“Perhaps.”

From my understanding, UCF is the best school in Florida for computer science.  However, from what I have seen, I see a lot more students from FIU get internship opportunities from big tech companies. So what exactly does UCF offer for CS students that other schools in Florida don't? 

FIU seems to have a lot of opportunities to get involved and to complete your degree having a lot of experience (Clubs, Research Opportunites, Student Web Developer Jobs, etc.). I know that UCF does offer this but I do not know if it is at the same scale as UCF, so if someone knows that would be great. The biggest problem that I have with FIU is how close it is to home, but I am willing to deal with it if I know that I will have more opportunities. 

Something else really important is the cost aspect. I will be receiving the Florida Academics Bright Futures Scholarship so all I will have to worry about is room/board and books. However, FIU is giving me about 10k a year which should leave me with some leftover money as well. UCF is only giving me 2.5k which is still nice, but I will still have some things to pay for. 

I am just hoping that I do not make the wrong decision. Any advice as I need to commit soon?"

tvd0jr,0,2022-04-03,UMD vs UVA for CS,ReasonableGround9056,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/tvd0jr/umd_vs_uva_for_cs/,"Hello! I was admitted to both of these universities as an out-of-state student and need help deciding where should I go next year. I saw a similar post from last year, but I have some specific questions so I will be posting them here. 

I will be majoring in CS for both with a focus on security. 

**UMD**

Tuition: 44,000 per year  
Pros:

* was not admitted directly to the cs program but LTSC (it is pretty easy to switch to cs)
* better cs program, receives a lot of funding from UMD 
* better location so probably more companies come to their career fair
* more research output 

Cons:

* huge school and cs program
* lot of cs majors so it might be hard to get into some classes (little fish in a big pond scenario)
*  professors seem to be split among good and bad
* dorms are pretty bad
* some people report a lack of social life, especially on weekends
* the outskirts of College Park seem to be dangerous

**UVA**

Tuition: 78,000 per year

Pros:

* more overall prestige so better name recognition
* much smaller cs program, so better connections with professors and easier access to opportunities
* Rodman scholar which is UVA's honor program (priority course, better dorms, research opportunities etc)
* campus and dorms are much better
* I like the feel of Charlottesville much better
* I have the possibility of doing a minor in economics or from McIntire

Cons:

* not as good of a cs program
* less research output than UMD
* fewer companies might be coming to UVA due to its location
* food is bad
* I'm worried about the preppy/fratty culture and the fact that I'll be an Asian in a predominately white community.

**TLDR:**

I think I would have a better social life and overall experience at UVA, but the only thing that stops me from committing is the exorbitant tuition and the fact that UMD has a higher-ranked and better cs program. However, I have done comparisons between the two programs and have determined that the courses and clubs are relatively the same. The difference comes in the fact that UMD has pushed a lot more research out than UVA. This is a factor to put into consideration, but I think it is negligible because I have research priority at UVA and the program is much smaller, making it less competitive for me to do research. In terms of employment, I compared both of the FAANG ratio (number of people employed at FAANG versus cs undergrads) on LinkedIn and found that UVA has a slight edge (7.7% for UVA compared to 6% for UMD). I think this is a result of the super large cs program at UVA.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of finances, I am an only child and my parents have the money to pay. However, I do not want to pose a heavy burden on them without a just reason. Please correct me if I am wrong about anything above.  Thanks!

Questions:

What do you guys think about my overall comparison/reasoning?

Is UVA worth it over UMD?

How is UMD's social life with such a large population?

Is UMD cs competitive to get classes, internships, and research opportunities?

Is it hard to switch from LTSC to CS?"

I’m thrilled to say I landed my first “gig”. I’ve been in school and working in retail for a long time, so landing this internship position is a huge accomplishment.

The role I was hired for is in the CyberThreat sector area. HR will send me a formal offer (written) with compensation tomorrow. 

However, I am just nervous. Right now I get paid 22/hr in my retail job (which is already above average). Im just nervous that they’ll offer like 15-18/hr and if that’s the case I’d be taking a huge pay cut and can’t afford that really… hate to say it. 

Say it’s lower than what I already am paid via retail … should I even try to negotiate? How would you phrase the negotiation? 

I must say, this is a remote position with a high possibility for extension until graduation (according to Director).

Has any one of you had success with negotiation?"
tvgvnt,1,2022-04-03,(Repost) — UW CS vs Berkeley EECS with Regents?,GatorBoyUSA,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tvgvnt/repost_uw_cs_vs_berkeley_eecs_with_regents/,"Hello Everyone,

I hope you are doing well! I think I posted before, but received no replies so I wanted to try again. So currently as a high school senior planning to pursue a career in the tech field, have narrowed my choices for college down to UC
Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington's CS program as a Direct Admit (my in- state school).

Many people advised me previously to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents
and Chancellor's Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding
which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual
Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my
degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and
that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For
example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that
experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? 

Overall, if cost isn't a factor,
what would make YOU choose one over the other? I am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!"
tvhu6j,1,2022-04-03,Masters in Pure Math for QR: Personal Project Recommendations,GirsanovsCorollary,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/tvhu6j/masters_in_pure_math_for_qr_personal_project/,"I am currently doing a masters degree in pure math. My thesis is in functional analysis/PDE theory. I also have a strong background in stochastic analysis/probability theory and moderate knowledge of ML theory. Moreover, I have an undergrad degree in econ and have done a couple of S&amp;T internships in banks, from which I gleaned that I have little desire to work in a banking environment (too much sales culture and minimal emphasis on the technical side of things). Currently, the role of option pricing quant at a prop shop market maker is what appeals to me the most.

My biggest weakness is on the programming side. I know basic MATLAB and have recently been learning Python for data science/ML applications, but I don’t have any concrete experience when it comes to programming. Therefore, my question is: what sort of personal project would be best suited for me to 
(a) get some experience with QR-related computational tasks/methods, and 
(b) best showcase/apply my mathematical knowledge?

Currently I am thinking about trying to put together a basic implementation of the Avellaneda-Stoikov model, but I’m not sure how this measures up in terms of feasibility and relevance to the current pricing-quant skillset. I guess another obvious option would be an implementation of a BS/local vol/Heston/jump-diffusion pricing model, but my lack of knowledge regarding industry practice makes it hard to determine the utility of each choice.

Any advice on how to better position myself for a career in quant research is greatly appreciated."
tvipqy,1,2022-04-03,Post-internship salary negotiation,strakerak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tvipqy/postinternship_salary_negotiation/,"So this summer, I'll be doing my first internship. Salary was 100k prorated for those ten weeks (that included a 5k signing bonus, which is huge in the state that I'm in).

Now, I already have a BS in CompSci and my experience comes academically as well as oddball projects that I could submit for cyber stuff or general engineering.

I finish my graduate degree the semester after my internship. They were asking about this because it seems like they want to pull me back in for full time (given that I perform well over the summer).

If so, what is the likelihood of negotiating a higher salary given I'll be finishing an advanced degree by the time my full time job would start? Do I just keep the salary that I have, or do I have a right to ask for a lot more in that case?"

My situation: I graduated May 2021 with a Bachelors in CS, am pursuing a post graduate certificate course (NOT masters) from Sep 2021 to Dec 2022 and will be applying to new grad positions in August 2022 ish.

I’m currently taking EECS 301, EECS 216, and Math 216 (at a local community college). I’ve already failed an EECS class before (for stupid reasons, so I’m retaking it this summer) and am on track to fail EECS 216 due to my exam scores  and maybe even 301, or at best end with a low passing grade in 301. I already feel insecure enough about the fact that I’m a girl in CE, and I always get worried that me doing poorly will further push stereotypes of girls being worse at CE. I really like engineering, but I’m nervous that I’m not good enough at it. The only thing I have going for me is a summer internship, and I’m nervous that I’m going to mess that up too. I’m also worried that I’m going to continue failing classes or get thrown on academic probation, even though I’ve developed good study methods which don’t seem to be working for my exams. Any advice? I feel really unmotivated and burned out:("

**Interviews**

Georgetown: (7/10) First interview, was pretty nervous at first but figured it out pretty quickly, had a good, but unremarkable conversation.

Dartmouth: (9/10) Talked with the guy for like 2 hours, seemed to really like me and told me he'd strongly recommend me

Will the company that I signed an internship with give me an option to convert to a full-time role or take the internship offer back? I know some companies have policies that require at least a semester of college to be completed after the internship. Thanks!

I don’t really know any code or language or tools or anything right now. I know the general path through college about internships/projects/LC and such, but I feel behind before anything has started (I guess that’s a common feeling after looking in here). And I’ve looked through resume roasts, and there are people my age/place in school and already have a well filled out resume. How am I supposed to get an internship a year from now (summer after freshman year) if I’m going into school as a blank slate?"
tvk76r,17,2022-04-03,A roller coaster ride with a happy outcome,throwaway00812394,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/tvk76r/a_roller_coaster_ride_with_a_happy_outcome/,"Edited title: Bay Area girl loses hope but gets into Duke

(didn't know you're supposed to have an objective title oops but I can't edit the actual post title)

**Demographics:** Asian female from Bay Area

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer science, put cog sci/psychology/media as other majors (I’ll either double major or minor)

**Academics**

* GPA: 4.47 weighted, 3.94 unweighted
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: took mostly honors and AP classes (10 classes, 14 exams)
* Senior Year Course Load: 4 APs, 1 honors elective, 1 non honors elective

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT: 1540
* AP: 4 on Physics I, C Mechanics, C E\&amp;M; 3 on European history (pandemic year), 5 on the others

**Extracurriculars/Activities (in order of on Common App, gonna be vague on purpose):**

* CS/HCI summer research internship
* Psychology summer research internship
* Editor of a student-run publication
* Student leadership position
* President and vice president of 2 clubs
* Dancer - lead roles in shows, some regional awards, did a dance portfolio for all the schools that allowed them
* Volunteering
* School performing arts
* Short AI summer camp

**Awards/Honors (in order of on Common App):**

* Big national award for a piece I wrote
* National French Exam Gold Medal
* Smaller awards for publication work
* Dance awards
* Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards

**Essays (random notes)**

* Personal statement: wrote about how dance has shaped me and taught me skills I use in many aspects of my life as I step back from dancing to make time for my other interests
* I was pretty proud of some of my why essays—they show something about me and express my excitement about specific opportunities at the school
* Some of my other prompt responses were gross though (ahem UVA quirk essay)
* I took advantage of the UChicago PDF upload and designed a page with some digital art for the celestial object prompt (still got waitlisted though)
* I reused essays whenever possible

**LORs:**

* English teacher: 8/10; I spoke up a lot in this class and wrote some interesting essays
* Bio teacher: 6/10; probably pretty impersonal because he wrote a lot of LOR and I didn’t stand out in class
* (Additional) Professor from CS research: 7/10; was recommended to use her letter to make my STEM side stronger, but my work was usually independent, so I didn’t get to know her that well besides just sharing my project progress
* (Additional) Mentor for one of my ECs: 10/10; I’ve worked with her for 4 years, and she knows students really well and knows how to talk about their strengths. Unfortunately, she didn’t finish the letter in time for most of my apps…

**Interviews:** Georgetown (8/10), Northwestern (6/10), UPenn (8.5/10), Princeton (9/10), and Duke (9.5/10, felt the most natural and conversational, I got to share some more fun parts of myself and learned a lot about Duke’s community and opportunities that got me excited)

**Decisions**

* *Acceptances:*
   * Duke!! &lt;3
   * UCSB Regents Scholar
   * UNC (EA - shoutout to them for being my bottom line school; that helped me take rejections less seriously)
   * Pitt Honors College with small scholarship
* *Waitlists:*
   * UVA (EA), UCD, UChicago, Wellesley, UCI, UCSD, CMU (info systems), Barnard, NYU, Emory, Tufts
* *Rejections:*
   * Yale (REA deferred first), UCB, UCLA, JHU, Northwestern, Pomona, Georgetown, Columbia, Princeton, Brown (very sad), UPenn, Stanford
   * USC but I got into their Viterbi Pathways Program (not sure how to categorize)

**Additional Information:**

* I think my dance portfolio helped me stand out for Duke because they actually have people in the dance department watch it. I also talked a lot about opportunities in duArts in my statement accompanying the portfolio and mentioned it in my why essay. Love how it’s a bonded arts community.
* Reflecting back, my profile doesn’t lean very STEM outside of my honors and AP classes, so that made it tough for me as a CS major applicant"

tvknc0,2,2022-04-03,Complicated college business. Need advice and help,Zubyking,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tvknc0/complicated_college_business_need_advice_and_help/,So I got an almost full tuition scholarship at utd as a cs major. It’s pretty nice but everyone hates on the school and I would have to be commuting which would prevent me from getting the college experience. The environment of the school is just weird but it’s in a good location for computer science majors due to internships and growing rank in stem. I also got accepted at the university of florida though which i have been considering for a while. My parents proposed that if I went to utd they would buy me a car and if i don’t like the school I could transfer out after a year or two. Is this a good deal? How hard is it to transfer from to a school like umd or uw madison or even ut austin for a cs major? Should I go to Utd for the first two years and gamble transferring or should I just go to UF directly?

9. Math honors society: I was president, planned and spoke at induction ceremony with 60ish people
10. Random school club: I was secretary, helped lobby school to bring equipment to school for the club

**Awards/Honors**

1. Top 5 in state for academic competition (800 competitors)
2. Top 5 in state for academic competition in different event (900 competitors)
3. NMSF
4. Local robotics award
5. Bronze president's volunteer service award

**Letters of Recommendation**

Nothing amazing. Teacher sponsor of academic competition, random teacher that I had for 2 years in a non STEM class, and counselor. All probably like 7/10.

**Interviews**

MIT: Went very well, we talked for 2 hours. My interviewer did the same academic competition as me in high school and we had many common interests.

A&amp;M Scholarship: Also went extremely well, my interviewer had basically the same life mindset as me and we talked about that.

Stanford: Very bland and boring, my interviewer kind of just smiled and laughed at everything I said, seemed superficial and not particularly good.

Doxxable thing: There were 2 rounds of interviews, the first one went absolutely amazing and my interviewer and I totally hit it off. Second round went horrible, I was blanking on what to say, and I was super nervous. I thought of wayyyy better things I could have said after the interview was over.

**Essays**

I did 4 different versions of my main common app essay, and I don't like any of them. Spent 50-75 hours total, and all 4 drafts talked about my life mindset and my motivations for everything, as well as connecting it to CS.

Spent around 10-20 hours on supps for each school, except I did Caltech, UChicago, Purdue, and the doxxable thing all the day before they were due in like 3 hours.

I don't like a single essay I submitted (main essay or supps) *except* I really like what I submitted to the doxxable thing.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UT Austin CS and Turing Scholars Honors (got in in December)
* Purdue (EA, also got into honors college)
* Georgia Tech (EA)
* Texas A&amp;M with a full ride scholarship (rolling, also got into university and engineering honors).

*Rejections:*

**Additional Information:**

I think there are a few reasons I didn't get into any reach schools. My stats are pretty much perfect, but my ECs are pretty lackluster. I don't think I didn't put in enough time, I just put time into the wrong activities. Kind of annoying that these days you basically have to know ""the right"" things to do (internships, research, etc) since freshman year to get into top schools rather than things that are fun, but it's whatever.

Some people definitely get accepted to top schools with my ECs, but they probably have exceptionally unique/interesting backgrounds or personalities, or they have amazing essays or rec letters, both of which I lack."
tvm21q,3,2022-04-03,what to do about horrible bad breath that's ruining my life?,butter-fingers-,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tvm21q/what_to_do_about_horrible_bad_breath_thats/,"i've had bad breath for around three years now and it has been absolutely awful. i'm still in high school and my entire high school experience has been me hiding from people and ignoring them and hiding from my friends because my breath stinks. it's so incredibly frustrating. there seems no end to it. i can't have a decent conversation with people. i'm avoiding all my friends. i had the worst breakdown of my life last year because of how much i was isolating myself. every time i get a decent opportunity, an internship, or even a travel opportunity, i need to turn it down because i cant be around other people because i smell like shit all the time. i can't take it anymore. if this problem doesn't go away i can only think of k\*ll\*ng myself because what the fuck else am i supposed to do.

&amp;#x200B;

it started when i was younger because i would always have a stuffy nose. people would always cover their noses around me whenever i would speak. i have also been told multiple times to my face that my breath smells horrible. and now you can even smell it through my fucking face mask. i think it's a sinus problem because i basically can't smell or taste at all because of how badly my sinuses are blocked all the time. i can feel post nasal drip at the back of my throat as well and it ALWAYS feels as if there is something (almost like a ball) stuck at the back of my throat and it doesn't go away no matter how hard i swallow it. sometimes if i drink a lot of hot tea then i can feel something move at the back of my throat but it never goes away. i tried checking for tonsil stones as well but couldn't find much.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been to the dentist, he just gave me a cleaning which did practically nothing. i went to the ENT as well who prescribed a bunch of meds that didn't do much either. i suspect it has to do with my sinuses because i've practically lost my sense of smell and i always sound very nasally when i speak due to blockage. has anyone dealt with anything similar? or does anyone have any opinions on this? anything would be appreciated, i need to rid myself of this curse. i've wasted most of my childhood and i don't want to fuck up college because of something as humiliating as this as well."
tvmbah,158,2022-04-03,girl applies and gets in + more,Any-Fox-9615,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/tvmbah/girl_applies_and_gets_in_more/,"(WARNING! LONG POST AHEAD) I’ve been dying to write this post, and I hope you all enjoy it :) And if you’re reading this and you know me, no you don’t! Okay, now onto the post:

**Demographics**

Gender: Female 

Race/Ethnicity: Nigerian-American (Yoruba rise up!)

Residence: DMV

Income Bracket: enough to need aid but get absolutely none (still applied for aid everywhere though).

Type of School: Public 
Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM

**Intended Major(s)**: Public Policy, Education, Political Science (mainly Public Policy for all schools that had the major; for Harvard and Yale I put Government and Sociology as my top concentrations respectively).

**Academics**

**GPA (UW/W):** 3.95UW / 4.53W

**Rank (or percentile):** 3 out of ~540 when I applied (dropped to 5 by the time midyears were sent)

*# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.:** 9 Honors, 14 APs, and Linear Algebra senior year. 

* Senior Year Course Load:*
AP Psych, AP Spanish Lit, AP Lit, Linear Algebra, Gym

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

*SAT I:* 1510 (760 RW, 750 M), single sitting

*AP/IB:* School only offers AP, I earned 5s (4) and 4s (3) 
 
**Extracurriculars/Activities**

This is how I listed my ECs on my Common App:

1. **Public Official Position** - Definitely my most impressive commitment. I’m purposefully not naming it because it would make me pretty easy to find online (we know how y’all love doxxing!!), but I am a full voting member of a governing body in my county. I chair a committee, approve budgets, pass policy, the whole shebang. Being a public official at 18 hasn’t been easy, but it's allowed me to make a change in the community I love! :)

2. **Equity Leadership Council** - Founded an Equity Leadership Council at my school. Work with neighboring schools to create community events on antiracism and social justice. Taught lessons to hundreds of grade-schoolers on diversity and inclusion. Hosted weekly forums on school-wide issues (I wrote extensively about this throughout my applications, it truly changed my life). 

3. **Social Justice Organization** - Secretary for a student organization within my school system. We’ve done book studies across grade levels, hosted county-wide student forums, hosted Read-Alouds to elementary schoolers, revised school curricula, and so much more. Again, this EC has connected me so deeply to my community and I’ve written about it through my apps. 

4. **Mental Health Nonprofit** - Director for a weekly podcast with people across the country (and the world!), promoted awareness on neurodiversity, and created pen pal programs with hospitals. We also got to be featured in Times Square, so that's a neat fun fact! 

5. **Youth Advisory Council** - Chairwoman for county YAC; completed service activities, created a legal literacy curriculum for English and Spanish learners, written testimony for state assembly, etc. Also provided feedback on county vaccination initiatives during the height of COVID-19. 

6. **Speech &amp; Debate** - Speech Captain. Competed at the regional, state, and national levels and earned an ample amount of awards along the way. I did OO, Duo, and my main event — Extemp &lt;3! Forensics used to be my whole life, and I owe my public speaking skills to those long yet fun hours spent in high school classrooms, speaking my heart out! 

7. **County Department of Social Services Internship** - Assisted board of directors; I mainly worked in a unit dedicated to young and single mothers. Managed social media and organized fundraisers and drives for products young mothers would need (think baby formula, clothes, car seats, etc.)

8. **Mock Trial** - Founder and Co-Captain for my school’s chapter. Though this is ranked rather low on my list of ECs, my mock trial team was very important to me and I wrote about it in several of my apps/ mentioned it in various interviews. My team started our first season losing miserably and finishing 1-5. We ended this year with the best record in our circuit (5-1). I think it's important to have clubs like this (outside of your “spike”, if you believe in that stuff anyway). Did I go/win at nationals? No. Was I the best attorney? Probably not. But I loved every second of it and I knew that when I was given the opportunity to speak about it, my words would drip with passion (a lot of times I would be on the brink of tears in interviews when speaking of how proud I was of my team’s progress). For any of my fellow attorneys/witnesses, remember to always rock the mock :)

9. **Part-Time Job** - Worked at McDonald’s for most of high school (until I quit and moved to Five Guys!!). I’ve been working at least 24 hours a week since sophomore year, though now I’ve cut down on hours b/c of EC #1. 

10. **Teen Advisory** - Was my HS’s representative to the Superintendent’s advisory team. It’s more impressive than it sounds, and when I was applying I thought it’d be a good idea to throw it in there since I’m interested in working in educational policy. My superintendent and I are super tight (though I did not ask him for a LOR, rip). 

11. I used my additional information section to explain not only the lack of rigor in my schedule (I only took 4 classes senior year) but also to mention relevant commitments and activities I participated in that I couldn’t fit into the EC section. **Do not** squeeze in every single club you’ve done within your life, it's not a good use of that section. I only included activities that were contextually relevant to me and my application as a whole. If you did fly-in programs for colleges as I did, this would be the time to mention it as well. 

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. AP Scholar with Distinction 
2. State Duo Champion (Forensics)
3. Community Service Award 
4. County NHD Award (1st)
5. NSDA Qualifier (3rd)

*I’m a bit vaguer with my awards, but they truly weren’t jaw-dropping;  I thought this might hold me back when applying to scholarships (I was **wrong**). Again, you don’t need to cure cancer or be nationally ranked to be successful within college admissions*

**Letters of Recommendation**

I actually got the opportunity to read ALL my LORs (take that FERPA!) so I can provide more accurate ratings. 

**US History Teacher (3/10)** I was actually shocked by how…plain it was. I’ve known him all 4 years of HS, he’s the advisor for many of my clubs. But his letter was only a paragraph or two. This doesn’t distract from our relationship (I still think we’re close!), but this goes to show that just because you’re close with a teacher doesn’t mean your LOR will be marvelous.

**English Teacher (8/10)** I’m so close with her!! I had her in 9th grade (which worried me since unis usually want a LOR from 11th) but now I have her for 12th. It was a solid letter. 

**World History Teacher (7.5/10)** I had him junior year and have done NHD with him all years of high school, and I thought he gave me a good letter that focused on my love of history. It wasn’t too personal but it did testify to my experience with studying history so it got the job done!

**Spanish Teacher (9.5/10)** Wow. I actually almost started crying after reading it. I’ve had this teacher through most of my Spanish classes, and he’s been instrumental to my journey towards fluency. His words were so kind and personal, and I had to beg my counselor to contact schools so I could get this letter switched in!! I was able to switch in this letter for Washu and Vandy and I think a couple of other schools, though I have no way of knowing if it made a difference. 

**Two Mentors (10/10)** I adored both of these letters, they made me tear up! I barely recognized the person they were describing, it made me so proud and emotional to see how they thought of me. I submitted it to any school that allowed for an Other Recommendation, in addition to different scholarship programs.  

**Interviews**

**Yale (9/10)** - My first interview; the alum was from the class of ‘80 and we talked for about 2 hours. He was a history major and I wrote about history throughout my application, so we bounced off one another. He gave me a ton of awesome book recommendations as well!! Since he had gone to school so long ago, it was hard to get answers that I had about current Yale, but I loved our conversation

**Duke (7/10)** - She was an attorney and attended in the 90s I believe? I’m really passionate about Mock Trial so we talked about the judicial system and lawyering for a while. Our conversation was pretty nice, but nothing notable. My mother actually thought it went poorly because I had nothing to say about it (shrug)

**Harvard (8/10)** - My interview had graduated quite recently, so it was easy to converse with her. Hearing her speak about the Harvard traditions almost made me fall for the school, but my college heart was somewhere else…it was a bit difficult because there were questions I wanted to ask that I knew she couldn’t really answer (mainly about the black experience at a school like Harvard) but overall I enjoyed our conversation! 

*Scholarships*

**Jefferson @ UVA (10/10)** - I did THREE interviews for Jefferson; I expected them to be nerve-wracking, but once I entered each call I felt great. I was able to get my points across, to respond promptly (thanks, competitive extemp!), yet still act and talk authentically, which is all one can hope for in an interview. 

**Banneker Key @ UMD (10/10)** - This one was very easy, probably because I’m instate and was already guaranteed half-tuition regardless. Plus, I had been through so many interviews by that point, so I felt like a seasoned veteran at it, LOL! 

**Robertson @ Duke  (yikes/10)** - I, honest to God, thought these were some of my worst interviews. My first one was timed (could only be 20 min), and I didn’t feel like I got across what I wanted to say. The final interview was a GRILLING, and they asked me questions I’d never encountered before. My interviewers were not as friendly as Jefferson (total poker faces), so it was hard to see if they were vibing with me :(( I was freaked out for what felt like an eternity while waiting for decisions to be released. 

**Essays** 

Common App Essay - I spent a couple of months writing this, bouncing around various ideas. I wanted to center it around my name but thought that was cliche, so I focused it around learning to take risks and finding my voice (a tad cliche as well..but I figured it out) It’s still my favorite essay I think I’ve written, I’m so proud of it. (9.5/10)

I’m not going to go over every single essay I wrote, but I was particularly proud of my Duke &amp; Yale supplements + my Harvard additional essay. I thought my weakest essays were my UNC and WashU ones… I took a literary approach to pretty much every essay I wrote, usually touching upon my cultural background, my upbringing, and how those two things influenced my intended areas of study.

**Additional Information:**

This post is a long time coming. I’ve been on r/ApplyingToCollege since the summer of my freshman year. I'm not going to give some insincere blurb about how I’m “aVerAge” and other self-deprecative shtick. What I *will* say is that I did not expect the results I got. 

For much of my high school and college admissions journey, my biggest obstacle was myself. I never thought I was good enough –even if that objectively wasn’t true. There were some programs that I didn’t apply for because I truly thought I had no business applying for such a prestigious opportunity (Coke Scholars, I’m looking at you). Preemptive imposter syndrome is real, and I had to fight against this feeling with every essay I wrote, LOR that I requested, and application I eventually sent in. With every r/collegeresults post I read, “how I got into x college” video I watched or members of A2C I talked to who achieved the goals I previously could only dream of, I never saw *myself* being amongst them. They always had one more impressive award or EC than I did, and their essays always seemed like literary genius compared to mine. I could never find someone that I thought I was comparable to, but throughout this year I realized something. My advice to underclassmen – there is no one like YOU applying. You are great, you are worthy and if you can’t seemingly find anyone like you that has achieved your goals, become the first you that does. 

It might seem easy for me to have a shiny view of college admissions given my results, but I acknowledge that we are thrown into a whirlwind with nowhere to grab onto for safety. College admissions is a crapshoot, a shitshow, and an almost impossible journey to navigate if you’re aiming for T20s. However, as a now rising college freshman who has made it out on the other side in one piece, all I can say is: give yourself a chance. You don’t need to be a God, you don’t need to be the next Bill Gates, you just need to be **you**, I promise that’ll be enough for the place you are meant to attend. 

Thank you to this entire community (the good, the bad, the ugly, and all the things in between) for everything. :) If any underclassmen want advice on any of these programs, I’d be happy to help. (don’t be weird and ask for personal info tho, which some people have already done 😳)."
tvmyua,0,2022-04-03,Thoughts on Cirrus Logic?,ProfessionalGift3152,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tvmyua/thoughts_on_cirrus_logic/,"Hi guys, I have got an internship offer from Cirrus Logic. I do not know much about the company but they are paying well. I found out that the company has a good work culture. However, I could not find much data(on glassdoor) about software roles as it is primarily a semiconductor company. So, if anyone has any idea about the company and especially in the software domain, please let me know. I really want to convert this internship into a full-time opportunity. Having said that, honestly, money is the primary concern for me because of the loans. So if I get some information on this, I would be able to plan my studies accordingly. If Cirrus pays well, I will focus completely on their stack from this moment, else I will do my best in the internship and will keep doing leetcode to find better opportunities."

i was a hot mess for the entire duration of college apps and when i sent an update form to all of my colleges in February i had copied and adapted it from my Columbia loci and it literally had columbia's name in it... i also demonstrated 0 interest which is probably why i only had large wins with big schools that don't really care about demonstrated interests. do not let this discourage y'all--i just was a horrible applicant and did not put in the work"

I was so close to ending it all, I almost died but came back, started changing my life around. Took the GED, got into community college, lost 70 pounds graduated with highest honors 3.9 gpa, and transferred to a relatively prestigious university, and I have a 3.7 here. I took every opportunity and did not rest during the summer, always doing internships and community service and volunteer work. Working in homeless shelters, volunteering at the hospital, and working for the suicide hotline at my school.  I even got a girlfriend and had an amazing year with her. But I feel like things are going downhill. I didn't get any internships although I had 5 interviews, my gf and I broke up because things weren't working out. I am doing poorly in one of my classes so I think I'm going to have to drop out of the class. 

I still have not made a single friend at my school. I transferred during when covid started, and I wasn't in dorms or did not meet a single person for the first year. Now I'm graduating next semester, and I don't have a single person I can call my friend. I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk about this either. I just feel so alone in all of this."

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Math teacher (7.5/10): I read a letter he wrote for an internship which he told me he tweaked for college. I've had this teacher for 2 years and kept in contact for a while during my junior year and I'm his current TA. I feel like he knows me pretty well and from what I read in the past it had specific moments that demonstrated me being a strong student.

AP Lang Teacher (8/10): I was able to read it because I needed her to repurpose her letter for a scholarship. Anyways, it was very specific to things I did in her class during virtual learning. I think it really showed both my personality and strength as a student and writer. Not SUPER close with the teacher but I definitely talked to her and went to her for help.

Club Sponsor (?/10): I didn't get to read this and I asked kinda last minute. He has been a sponsor for my club for a while but I was never suppperrr close with him but I can tell he knows I'm a hard worker. Don't have much to say but I sure it was positive and played on my strengths as a leader.

Counselor (?/10): I didn't read this and I didn't talk to my counselor that much except to bother him about my classes. He requested a LOR sheet that asked a series of questions and I answered them, not much to say. I'm pretty sure its fairly positive and maybe a bit generic but he knew I was a top student in my class so I hope there was a bit more to say?

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Dartmouth (6/10): Couldn't really relate to my interviewer and kind of overwhelmed her with what I was doing and had to elaborate a lot. My interviewer didn't seem super interested as well. Tbh this was my first interview and I was a nervous wreck.

MIT (7/10): Interviewer was really nice and majored in what I was interested in. Overall I feel like I rambled a lot but he was very understanding and asked a lot of questions.

Harvard (8/10): I loved my interviewer but she didn't have much to say about Harvard since she only did her graduate there. I got to elaborate on a hobby of mine that I have done for years which really impressed her because she had never knew a community and hobby like that existed.

Princeton (8.5/10): I LOVED MY INTERVIEWER. He was so sweet and I felt like I could connect to him the most. I got to really show my personality and really emphasized my love for learning in both STEM and humanities. He responded to my thank you emailing after our interview saying that I would thrive at Princeton and reported to that effect.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Common App (7/10): I liked my prompt but I did not spend enough time writing it. I only had 2 people look over it which is a horrible idea. I wrote about my mothers fear to travel as an immigrant and how it manifested in me not taking risks (a bit cliche but I genuinely felt emotional and vulnerable when writing). If I had spent more than a week to write this and had more feedback I definitely think it would be a lot stronger.

Supplemental essays: I wrote so many of these days or hours before the deadline so they were very cookie-cutter. I think they got the picture of my interest in bridging sociology and CS. Don't have much to say but they 100% could have been better.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I applied to a lot of safety schools in my state which I won't include because I don't think they're that important. I was just scared I wouldn't get into college.

**Additional Information:**

I'm extremely happy to get into the schools that I did but I am a bit disappointed. I wrote a lot of my supplementals and essays last minute so that's on my part, but I was somewhat happy with some of my essays only to be rejected LMAO. Hopefully this post shows that scores don't 100% determine your success because my AP scores were trash."

I know it's late in the season but they were all still up so I figure there was no harm in trying.

How long should I wait before accepting I probably won't get anything? Do most small companies let you know you've been rejected or is ghosting pretty common among all sizes?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)

* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids
* 24	Alternatives to medical for PCB kids
* 25	Stuff/programmes to do in India as a gap year student
* 26	MSc in quant Econ Vs MBA in terms of ROI, job opportunity etc
* 27	MBBS from foreign country
* 28	How to prepare for SAT
* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios

* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!
* 43	The unequal relationship between Profs and students with no safety net for students
* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.

I’m seeing all of these people with incredible stats get denied (and I understand their essays could be crap but I’m still nervous). To say the least, my UW gpa (3.5 UW &amp; 4.3 W after sem 1 jr yr) is kind of bad due to a really bad depressive episode that occurred during my sophomore year (damn covid). I got a couple C’s a few B’s and a couple A’s. After everything started opening back up, I decided to really pop off this Junior year and try to make up for that awful Soph year. I managed to get all A’s in all of my IB courses (except a B in AP physics lol), founded the first National Science Bowl and Ocean Science Bowl teams in my area and managed to score the captains hip position after competing with another kid and I’ve held a few leadership positions. I’ve been told over and over again that I’m not competitive enough just because of my GPA, despite my whole covid situation + financial issues in the family.

I know I can get a pretty solid essay because of my brothers guidance + some professor friends (brother went to UCB and other got PHD at Loma Linda) but despite this I keep getting told that I won’t make a good uni and it’s genuinely stressing me out 

Some controllable factors I can try to strengthen right now is boosting my GPA this 2nd semester (rn I have all A’s in all my IB and AP classes) and hitting the books hard for exams in may 

I can try to strengthen my EC’s more, which I have quite a few with many many many hours in (550+). And I may try to apply for an internship in my area or try to shadow an engineering company 

Can anyone offer me advice? On what I should do? Also if you want to know more you can private message me so I can give you my full “resume”"
tvqiad,5,2022-04-03,Second guessing if I should go back to Big 4 after graduation,marcusshin0824,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/tvqiad/second_guessing_if_i_should_go_back_to_big_4/,"Hello, I am currently an undergrad student majoring in accounting (CAN). I am currently interning at RSM (my 8th month currently) and during the summer I will be going to KPMG for another internship.

I am mostly sure I will receive a return offer from both firms but I can’t help but have second thoughts of if I really want to go for Big 4.

I enjoy the atmosphere at RSM and just going through busy season where I don’t work over 55 hours per week makes me wonder if I’d like Big 4 for a couple thousands more and working instead 70 hour weeks. Exit opportunities seem great and I’ve seen people from Big 4 going to great places compared to people who have left RSM. If I were to go for the Sr. manager route I think it would be way more bearable going to mid market, but can’t help to think that Big 4 will take me further in my career (but the horror stories scare me).

What are your thoughts? I’m not asking for people to make a decision for me but rather an opinion.

5. National Merit Semifinalist (12th; now a finalist but did not update any colleges)
6. Various school awards that were selected by teachers from each subject area (9th-11th; added in Additional Info)

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Counselor Rec (6-8/10): I did not meet them very much until this year but they seemed very enthusiastic to write a letter for me. We connected a lot more when I got National Merit Semifinalist and they already had to write a letter for the finalist app for that.
* APUSH Teacher Rec (6/10): Was a good letter that talked about lots of good qualities of me in the classroom, but the teacher did not know me out of class very well.
* Math Teacher Rec (8-9/10): Have known this teacher since 10th grade through Math Club. They're very familiar with my personality, work ethic, and how I am in the classroom &amp; out of it.
* Robotics Coach (9/10): Talked about my leadership qualities, my abilities from their perspective as a software engineer, and how I made it possible for our team to compete during COVID.

**Interviews**

* Princeton (8/10): The interviewer was very chill and it was a very enthusiastic conversation that let me really talk about myself and all of my interests.
* Yale (6/10): It felt like a very standard interview, with nothing too special. It was nice how they let me talk about how COVID has affected me in high school.
* Harvard (7/10): The interviewer was also very chill, but it seemed more like structured question &amp; response format than a conversation. They really let me focus on describing my school environment and circumstances with how there's lots of problems with funding and the quality of instruction.
* MIT (9/10): The interviewer was super interesting and we connected on a lot, including on software engineering. It was my longest interview too at almost 90 minutes. The interviewer hinted that declaring CS on my application may not have been the best idea with how competitive it is.
* Stanford (9/10): We connected well right away and talked a lot about how technology is changing healthcare, as the interviewer was a local pediatrician.

**Essays**

* Common App (8/10): Talked about my fear of public speaking, years of speech therapy, and eventual success in debate.
* Supplements (5-9/10): Reading back through my essays again, lots of the ""Why Us"" essays were very generic. However, in the other essays, I feel like I really showed my passion for computer science and learning with lots of very specific anecdotes (vaccine website, programs that I made during an internship) of how I have used computer science to help others.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* State Flagship University (EA; $11k/yr scholarship)
* &gt;!Georgia Tech (EA2)!&lt;
* &gt;!Yale (RD; had a likely letter in February!!)!&lt;
* &gt;!Brown (RD)!&lt;
* &gt;!Duke (RD)!&lt;

*Waitlists:*

* MIT (deferred EA)
* Caltech (RD)
* Carnegie Mellon SCS (RD)
* Cornell (RD)
* Harvard (RD)
* Princeton (RD)
* Columbia (RD)
* UPenn (RD)
* Johns Hopkins (RD)

*Rejections:*

* UChicago (deferred EA, never sent LOCI)
* Northeastern (deferred EA, never sent LOCI)
* Stanford (RD)
* Northwestern (RD)
* Boston (RD)

**Thoughts:**

That Yale likely in February really came in clutch as I had a lingering fear in the back of mind for a really long time that I would not get into any of my reach schools. The amount of rejections that I've seen for Asian Males in CS with impressive profiles that I've seen in this subreddit is scary. I didn't get into my top choice CS schools (MIT, Carnegie, Stanford, Caltech), but I'm still extremely happy with how everything went.

The amount of waitlists that I got surprised me too. I was expecting a lot more rejections and would have never predicted not getting a single Ivy rejection. I know it's a bit of a toxic mindset to have but it makes me wonder where I would be if I just did a little more, but I think I did the best I could with the school environment that I'm in.

If I could give advice to other asian males applying to CS, or just in general, I would say to try to really stand out from the crowd, especially through extracurriculars and essays. When I reread the essays of the places that I got accepted to, many included *very* specific details about the school and very personal anecdotes that connected to my CS interests and personality.

It's between Yale and Brown right now, but I'm leaning towards committing to Yale!"

I got rejected from every college I got applied to, except Penn State. All for Computer Science(CS). And im honestly not sure what went wrong. I was a team leader for robotics programming subteam, 2 internships with well reputed companies, and a Debate club team captain. Im also top 30 in my grade out of 500. 

Istg I fucking cried in my room the entire time when I got the rest of my rejections. I feel like my life would be better if I ended it. I see absolute bum-asses with 1200 SATs and no extracurriculars get into UMich and UMD CS, but I don’t…? My parents don’t make this any better saying I’m a waste of space and how CS requires hard work ethic which I don’t have. 

This isn’t a post to make me love Penn State CS although you can say smth along those line if u want, but really this is just a rant abt how I wish it turned out better.

1. If there are any engineering, international, non-US citizens here, or if you know someone who is, can you please let me know if you/they have a job offer from a company(or companies if you had multiple), and if possible which company.
2. Which companies, if any, come to campus to hire undergrads for full time work post-bachelors, or for internships during the summers?

tvubd5,1,2022-04-04,Life After Psych Meds,OkCredit7318,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/tvubd5/life_after_psych_meds/,"So a little back story, for the last 3 to 4 months I have been weaning off of my psych meds I've been taking for the last 8 years or so. I made the executive decision to get off of these meds (venlafaxine, lamotragine, and vraylar) due to the fact that they were simply not working. I have made a few attempts on my life whilst on these medications. My depression Symptoms never really got better after all this time. I was a cutter in Grad school (I was 28 when I went back to school, was working, and had an internship. I was going 7 days a week for like 12 to 14 hours a day for 2 years). My depression was really bad and I did not have a support group I could rely on, I was very stressed, and actively and steadily decompensating the whole time I was there. I was able to muscle through it and get my MSW and eventually got my therapist license. My most recent attempt was about a year+ ago and that was when I made the decision to get my psychiatrist to put a plan in place for me to wean off my meds because things were horrible on the meds and it was worth a shot because I didn't really have anything to lose. If things are as bad as they were on the meds than off the meds, then at least I could save some money on prescriptions and psychiatrist sessions. Anyways the weaning off process for the venlafaxine was fine, no real negative effects on my mood, though processes, or emotional regulation. Now when I was weaning off the Vraylar, things were pretty hairy. Basically all of the symptoms I have experienced during a depression meltdown that led to an attempt, I was experiencing again. It was pretty brutal and it feels like things are getting somewhat better as, even though I was dealing with the same symptoms, there was no impulse to harm or attempt. I just finished the weaning off period and the subsequent 1 month ""cool down"" for the meds to fully get out of my system. I'm still dealing with a lot of symptoms related to what I think is what withdrawals feel like for an addict. I get ""brain zaps"" (google this to get a definition), I still consistently think, fantasize, dream, and plan ending things on my own terms (it actually makes me feel better about my situation fantasizing about ending that pain), I've also been dealing with a lot of anger (I'm a very patient and tolerant person, and I'm not used to having this constant level of anger/frustration lurking underneath). I've been self medicating with lots of weed and going on morning and night drives where I basically vent all my anger and frustration whilst driving (just unloading negative thought after negative thought). A lot of what I think about is previous issues I've had with people who have treated me unfairly and I fantasize about what I could have said. I take the diplomatic route whenever I have a conflict. But these internal narratives about what I should have said are very mean, blunt, angry, and vicious. My temper is much more labile than it has been in my life.  I'm used to turning the other cheek when people (usually my family) treat me unfairly, are mean or judgmental, are just plain rude. Now I'm more likely to go on a vicious and mean tirade when someone says something mean or ignorant. I don't know if this a good thing or not. On one hand I'm standing up for myself (I've spent most of my life getting shit on by my family and I and no recourse  but to grin and bear it) but on the other hand I have the capacity to be very mean and in extreme detail (I've been fat shamed pretty much by my entire family and the most recent family member that gave me shit, I went off on and basically used my keen observation skills to put this whole family member's life on blast). Of course my family is acting like I'm the crazy one and am out of line for defending myself. Anyways, I'm on week one of the weaning off period and I'm still dealing with emotional disregulation (openly sobbing combined with negative thoughts, anger, anxiety/panic attacks etc.). My question is has anyone had any personal experience with weaning off of anti depressants after a long period of time? And if so, how long do these withdrawal symptoms from not being on meds last? Will it get better after everything is completely out of my system? 

Thanks for reading my mini biography. I appreciate any advice anyone has"

5. International Science, Art, and Poetry Competition 2nd Place (2021)

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. my history teacher: 10/10 i'm the only student in this cohort that had him for all four years and he really got to see me evolve from being (lowkey a terrible writer and student w no passion in history) to someone who could easily have an hour-long conversation about current events w him. we were always p close and his letters of rec especially are known to be arts of work like he only accepts 3 students to write letters of rec for every year and no one that he's written recs for have not gotten into a t10. literally *insane*
2. my biology teacher: 6/10 honestly, in hindsight, i would have asked another teacher but i thought at the time that it made sense to have one of my recs be a bio teacher bc i wanted to do something w bio and my chem teacher had retired. i know him decently well and had his class for 2 years but one of which was online. overall chill dude, but not as close to him.
3. my counselor: 9/10 idk if this counts, but my counselor also has a background in creative writing and english lit and i was one of the few ppl who started talking to her since freshman year (i was asking her about hosting a spoken word poetry slam and how i should organize it) and we have an amazing bond! she's also a brilliant writer too!
4. my english teacher: 12/10 i only had him for ninth grade but i can tell you now that he is easily the strongest letter of rec. we're *very very very close* and ik him outside of an academic setting, and even after he's moved away we're still in close contact and send each other our writing. he helped me out of the darkest period of my life, when i was doing terrible things to my body and for that he'll always have a special place in my heart. also he's the most beautiful writer!
5. my research advisor: 8/10 it was honestly a last minute decision, but we're decently close and he's a brilliant writer and i've had a few p long conversations w him both in a joking around way and just about life in general and yeah!

**Interviews**

i didn't really do any interviews except for a few in junior year (tulane and case western) both of which went pretty mediocre -- i had no idea what i was doing at the time and just winged it! 6/10 for both!

**Essays**

my personal essay? \*chef's kisses\* the one part of my application that i am truly incredibly proud of! i made my counselor cry when she read my final draft. it was a p cliche topic, about being asian american and how that fueled my love for creative writing, but i took this really cool poetic style in telling the story and i would ramble on about it but that might be a bit much, so personal statement? 11/10

all my supplemental essays are p decent, i just submitted different versions of like four of the same essays to every single school (my counselor got *really* tired of reading them after a while). the only person i let read and asked to review my essay was my counselor and even then it's just basic stuff so they're all p authentic and stuff! i took a poetic spin on all of them and played around w the structure and stuff and at the moment, i despised them, but in hindsight they were actually really good ahaha! 8-9/10

**Decisions -- Listed In The Order That I Like Them (completely personal ahaha!)**

*note:* ik it looks like a lot, but i had waivers for most of them! i didn't include financial aid j merit scholarships per year in here!

*Acceptances:*

* Stanford University (RD, probably committing, but still waiting on financial aid!)
* University of California Berkeley (RD, $10,000 in research funds + $10,000 scholarship)

* Rice University (RD)
* University of Southern California (RD)

**Additional Information:**

in my additional info, i just detailed the different research initiative i was involved in and put an abstract of my ib extended essay on immunotherapy and melanoma!

ik it must sound so pretentious to say that blah i was insanely insecure initially about not getting into a college, but i'm completely serious. perhaps it's bc i didn't follow the same robotics + speech and debate + leadership route that all of my peers did and perhaps i simply lack lots of self confidence and have a terrible habit of undermining my accomplishments and comparing myself to others (sadly, a linkedin stalker :( but working on it!). i had two pretty major mental breakdowns summer before senior year and went into a deep bout of depression (esp when i got sucked into the often unhealthy cycle of reddit -- like don't get me wrong y'all are great but to a stressed junior w no self esteem? nope)

and so when making my college list, i didn't apply to most of the ivys and t20s bc i didn't feel like i would get in. i loaded up on safeties bc i was terrified of not getting in anywhere. in hindsight, i do kinda wish i could see how i stack up to some of the other ivys i didn't apply to and i, overall, wish i applied to less schools and spent more time on supplementals for each college.

but i think the one school i def didn't regret applying to was upitt bc it was my first application (in like early oct) and i got my results (acceptance!!) in 3 days and it was a *massive* confidence booster like my parents and i literally cried tears of joy when i got it because *oh my gosh i'm got into a college*. for any juniors reading, highly recommend applying to a safety rolling school first!

but yeah! i think that to any rising seniors who are reading and feel intimidated by all the amazing ppl in college results -- remember that you've got a whole lot more activities and accomplishments than you think!! have faith in your application and i wish y'all the best of luck! and to my rising college freshman, i hope you have the most amazing experience in the college you end up at and wishing y'all the best of luck too!"
tvxezc,14,2022-04-04,Need advice/shit post on current existential dread,throwaway3432231231,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/tvxezc/need_adviceshit_post_on_current_existential_dread/,"Hi everyone, 

 I've been having anxiety spirals and have decided instead of thinking myself to death about it, I'd really appreciate your honest advice/ guidance (it would truly mean the WORLD to me). For context, im a Business-Economics majors:

I transferred from my community college to UCSD in 2020. I took calculus 2 and 3 during the summer and got a B in order to meet the prerequisites for the upper division econ courses. 

However everything fell apart when I entered for fall,  I took on ECON 100a, 110a and 120a- I did the P/NP, barely passed 100a, but failed hard at 100a and 120a. I thought I would be able to make it up the following quarter, Winter 2021 and I failed \`100a and 110b. The following summer I retook ECON 100b and barely passed with a C. The following Fall 2021- I took 120a and scraped by with a B- (yikes) and last quarter Winter 2022, by the hair on my chin pass with a C- , but overall term GPA 1.85 (i'm currently on academic probation).

I'm doing academically awful (current cumulative GPA and I'm feeling lost. I'm currently a 'senior', but instead of graduating Spring 2022, I'm delaying 1 year to graduate at Spring 2023. I'm late in the game and have been trying to look for internships and I don't even have the grades to meet the bare minimum requirements. To make it worse, I haven't join any communities or clubs to stand out. 

Just based off of the GPA calculator, even if I were to score perfectly from now until Spring 2023, my GPA would be max 3.1. Which is no dice for any graduate schools nor any prestigious internships, but I still want to try. 

I personally really want to get into business/data analysts and have been trying to learn these skills on my own time, but I'm not even close to being job market ready. I wanted to extend my stay for a year in order to complete a minor in Finance, but I see that there are some data modeling courses offered by Rady. Would it be more meaningful to take on the minor in Finance and take the assortment of classes towards data modeling?

All this to say, I would sincerely appreciate your advice on what I need to start/stop doing- I can't blame anyone but myself for failing the classes and not being active in clubs/communities. I want to try anything from now until Spring 2023 to try and turn the ship. 

Thank you!

Your fellow depressed Triton"

\* Gender: Male

\* Race/Ethnicity: Korean (International)

\* Residence: Midwest

\* Income Bracket: $200-250k (full pay)

\* Type of School: Private boarding (9-10) -&gt; Early College Program (11-12) &gt;!Actually I think my first school was better in terms of academics and college matriculation, but I transferred due to mental health reasons caused by the dorm's extremely toxic environment. However, I did not mention that on Common App because I was worried about schools that require freshmen to live on-campus!&lt;

\* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): nope

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Intended Major(s)\*\***: Computer Science 😱

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Academics\*\***

\* GPA (UW/W): 4.0 UW / \~4.6 W (unofficial) - &gt;!To be specific, I had a 99.2% UW in grades 9-10 and 4.0 UW in grades 11-12 so far. Projected to drop to 3.97 due to senioritis though!&lt;

\* Rank (or percentile): school doesn't rank

\* \\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Took 5 honors in grades 9-10 (AP/IB not available), took \~76 college credits during grades 11-12 including all undergrad 200-level CS courses.

\* Senior Year Course Load: &gt;!Calc 3 (aka multivariable &amp; vector calculus), Linear Algebra, Elements of Stats, Engineering Physics II/Lab, Data Structures (CS), Big Data Analysis, Human Bio, etc. (all dual enrollment)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

\* AP/IB: Comp Sci A (5, exam only)

\* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): none - &gt;!CMU still requires one but I got a waiver kind of thing due to mental health reasons!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Extracurriculars/Activities\*\***

1. Game Development (9-12): developed video games and published on Nintendo Switch and Google Play, sold 1,000+ copies
2. Artificial Intelligence Research w/ CS Professor (11-12)
3. Founder/President of some club (10): planned fun activities and hosted community service trips
4. Residence Hall Council - Programming Chair (11-12): played a major role in planning/preparing events for dorm residents
5. Internship (10): did maintenance and upgrade work on a local company's website
6. Math Club - Student Leader (10): assisted president and VP
7. Weekly Online Math Competitions (11-12)
8. Community Service Trip to Tanzania (10)
9. CS Online Summer Camps (11)
10. Honor Society of my dual enrollment university (11-12)

And the following updates were reported on the LOCIs:

1. Robotics: placed 3rd in a national collegiate competition; wrote the code, designed 3D print objects, controlled the robot, and helped assemble the robot. (I joined the club this semester so I didn’t put it on my applications)
2. Developed an application for the school (student management system), currently pilot testing with the math department

I'd rate my ECs as average or below average for the schools I applied to. They may look like a lot because I transferred schools, but I didn't spend *that* much time on ECs overall.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Awards/Honors\*\***

1. State collegiate math competition: 2nd place
2. Some programming competition: 1st place
3. Hackathon: top projects
4. State math competition: 7th place
5. Honor roll &amp; some school awards

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Letters of Recommendation\*\***

English teacher (9/10) - She taught me in 9th grade and was my club’s advisor in 10th grade. I think she really liked me. We went out to get boba and eat pho every week &gt;!until the school admin found it out and got pissed off!&lt;

Math professor (6/10) - No special connection with him besides having the highest grade in his class. I asked him only because I didn't have anyone else to ask.

Research professor (5/10) - She liked my projects and my ""efforts"", but I doubt she wrote a good LOR... I've never seen her smile, and she's infamous in my school for being mean to students. Again, I didn't have anyone else to ask.

Counselor (8/10) - I think we connect well, I meet her every week just to sit down and chat for an hour. She also asked me to develop an app for the school, which I did. (This was after I submitted my RD apps though. I got to put that on my LOCIs but not my application.)

\+ I asked my CS teacher from 9-10th grades for a LOR in May, but he refused because he has already received 60+ requests in MARCH… If he did write me a LOR I believe it would’ve been an 8-9. Ask early!!

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Interviews\*\***

MIT (6/10) - This was the only interview I was offered, and I think it was mediocre. He was a retired professor at the state flagship college, and we didn’t have much in common, so it was just a back and forth of questions and answers. Probably didn’t help with my application but also didn’t harm it. I’m just glad I got through it.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Essays\*\***

Honestly, I think my essays were pretty bad by my standards. I had a mental breakdown last summer so I had a late start with the essays, not to mention that I had absolutely no knowledge about what to write in these essays. I did have someone revise my essays, but he was just an overpriced Grammarly Premium.

I wish I was able to spend more time with my essays, as my essays probably did not reflect my full essay-writing potential. It would probably be a B/B+ if it was graded.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

\*Acceptances:\*

\* UMich - Ann Arbor (deferred EA) - **COMMITTED**

\* UC Irvine w/ 20k scholarship (RD)

\* UC Davis (RD)

\* Case Western (RD)

\* RPI (EA)

\* UC San Diego as 2nd-choice major (Math-CS)

&amp;#x200B;

\*Waitlists:\*

\* Georgia Tech (deferred EA, waitlist RD)

\* Rice (RD)

\* Cornell (RD)

&amp;#x200B;

\*Rejections:\*

MIT (deferred EA), Caltech (EA),  UIUC (EA), USC (Priority RD), CMU (ED2), Harvard (RD), Stanford (RD), UC Berkeley (RD), UCLA (RD), UC Santa Barbara (RD), UT Austin (RD)

&amp;#x200B;

Yup, I shotgunned to 20 schools. I didn't really have a choice though, since college admissions have been extremely unpredictable for CS applicants recently. Writing all the essays was tough but it was worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Reflection\*\***

Having probably the worst possible demographics (Asian, male, international, STEM-CS) with no hooks, I'm not really surprised I got rejected from most of the colleges I applied to.

Having all the rejections was pretty painful at that moment though. It was especially worse because my college counselor wasn't really up to date—he thought UIUC and UT Austin were safeties... 🙄  I clearly knew those weren't safeties, but I guess I was brainwashed by all the compliments he made. Be careful with your counselors; don't always trust them.

I've committed to UMich College of Engineering! It's one of the top schools for CS, and I'm really happy with it. They will also accept 40-50 of my dual enrollment credits, which will (hopefully) let me graduate in 3 years. Kinda cool.

DM me or comment if you have any questions, or if you're also going to UMich for CS!"

**Chemistry Olympiad (11)**: Narrowly qualified for nationals at my school. Hopefully, it goes well

**Science Olympiad (11)**: I think this is the most basic extracurricular on the planet, so I probably won't include it, to be honest. It's fun though!

**Summer Research Camp (11)**: Free research summer program at the local university, where I'll be working in a mass spectrometry lab using data analysis for like 40hrs a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Other stuff

**Essays**: I have like three essay drafts I'm considering using. One is about growing dreadlocks, another on code-switching (speaking in different accents), and another on skateboarding. 

**LORs:**

10th grade AP Chem teacher - Started off really bad in his class during sophomore year, trying my best and putting in hours yet failing. Saw me go from that to getting 5 on AP, and being involved in lab work + competitions.

11th grade English teacher - Loves my skill at debating, and we talk about books a lot. He's a white guy teaching a cultural studies class and we've exchanged books and had discussions. I think he provides a good picture of how I'm not zoned in on just STEM.

Counselor - We're pretty close, and she loves my ambition and writing.

**Schools**: (top picks)

Columbia ED

UChicago EA

MIT

tvxxx0,39,2022-04-04,1st time ever going to a club alone and it was absolutely amazing,GodMode_Unleashed,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/tvxxx0/1st_time_ever_going_to_a_club_alone_and_it_was/,"TL;DR: never considered going to a club alone to even be an option, did it, had the time of my life. 

First, let me thank you all for all the motivating stories on this sub of people who did this before! I don’t think I could have motivated myself to do this without those!

Background story: I (25M) turned 25 two weeks ago and I’m almost graduating and ready to start working for the company where I’m doing my graduation internship. Normally in the weekends, I like to go out with friends. Just after my birthday, I had been jokingly telling everyone that I’m getting old because the age of 30 is now closer than the age of 20 for me. However last week, that actually really hit home. I came to the realization that if I’m not actively going to do something, then in ten years, I’m going to look back on ten years of working from 9 to 5 on weekdays, and spending weekends with the same people in the same places (considering they’ll continue to live their lives as they do now). And I really didn’t like that idea.

Although I’m now looking at how to change my life, I had no idea where to start. Last Friday night, I got an amazing opportunity to do so. I had unexpectedly ended up in town with a friend. We went to a club I regularly visit. He needed to go home very early, so we only stayed there for 30 minutes, and it was only 12:30 AM. I strongly considered staying there on my own, but I couldn’t manage to put myself to it, and I chickened out. Afterwards, I felt really bad for missing this opportunity.

For the Saturday night, that same friend and I would also be going out; we had already planned that beforehand. However, when it was almost time to go, he sent me a message that his girlfriend was feeling sick and he needed to be with her. I was all dressed up and ready to go when I received his message, and having missed a chance to step out of my comfort zone the night before, I felt very strongly that this couldn't be a coincidence and that I had to make up for my missed opportunity.

So I spent some time motivating myself, and then I got up. I put on my jacket and went into town. I went to that same club I regularly visit so I know some people there. Often enough though, I don’t even see a single person I know at all. This time, I only knew that some girls I vaguely know were there, but they’re always there with a group of people I wouldn’t normally join without it being awkward. For all I knew, I would need to actively socialize or party on my own.

I went in there and walked around for a minute. I met those girls that I vaguely know, and it was just so different than before. I was very much in the mood to socialize now that I was alone. I now had a great time with them and I got introduced to all the guys of the entire group. They were all very sociable and we a great time. I even met a girl who happened to be living literally on the other side of the street where I live. She’s new in town and she was also out alone, looking to meet people. She showed me her place and she gave her my number when I left (to be continued).

Looking back, it was one of my best choices in a long time, and I can’t wait to do it again! It’s so funny to see how a different mindset attracts such a different result. Normally when going out with others, I’m never that much into socializing and way more into dancing and just having a good time. And now, even when I’m waiting in line at the bar, I’m looking for ways to socialize with others, and I’m having a lot of fun interacting with strangers. It felt so free to be there on my own and not feeling the need to go back to a group of people. I can’t wait to do this on other days (most people I know that go there do so on Saturdays) and other places and expand my comfort zone!

I now understand why people like to go out on their own. I saw some success stories on this sub and I just want to let you know that I have really appreciated those. Thank you very much for that, and to all of you: have a good and social day!"

I managed to land what I thought was my dream spot and I even get paid to do it (albeit, a third of a full time engineer, but still!). It’s a defense aerospace contractor

However, there really is not much to do. Even less that’s engineering relevant.

Currently I got 6-7 tasks, however to continue I am waiting for response or meetings. We have weekly meetings, and I keep telling my supervisors 
 I don’t have much to do. Sometimes I get tasked with non-engineering related work. 

I follow 4 engineers, and I feel like I keep asking for more assignments. But their projects go years back, and me catching up would take too much time.

So, I’m unsure what to do. I spend less than 37 hours a week. 

2 days a week, I work from home. And those days I’m maybe active for 3 hours. 

What should I do? Keep nagging for more work, or enjoy having more time?"

My job isn't too bad and the pay is pretty good but I just have no interest in the topic or in business in general which is my major. The career area is pretty niche and I just can't tell if it's the job, business in general, or just working that's making me feel so burnt out. I work remotely and I do enjoy WFM but it gets pretty isolating and I honestly just constantly feel so lost at work. There's so much to learn and my company lacks structure, my manager is pretty laid-back but he's so busy that I maybe see him once a month. I'm always so lost and just overwhelmed by the material and just feel like I'm drowning and just trying so hard to stay afloat. 

I've been here for almost 3 months and just have no motivation to do any of the work anymore, there's also just a steep learning curve in this career and it's hard to find the motivation to learn when you are so burnt out and just are not interested in this topic. I've always been an extremely hard worker and have done really good in college but now I just feel so pathetic and just have absolutely no drive. I just miss that college experience and studying-which I lost as COVID happened my sophomore year and I spent the rest of my school year until graduation online.  I also constantly have extreme anxiety about work, I've had internships and part-time jobs before and I've dealt with anxiety but nothing close to this bad. I have trouble sleeping and as soon as it's Friday I'm already anxious about Monday starting. My career path isn't a typical 9-5, people work pretty long hours and the remote environment leads to different time zones and just strange hours overall. It's also difficult to see my friends all in college still enjoying their lives and traveling while I just feel so burnt-out and defeated. Does anyone else feel this way? And if anyone has what did you do to deal with it? I'm honestly not sure if it's just me or the adjustment to post-grad life, my company, my career path overall, or all of the above."

There’s so many unknowns (including even when I actually start but sometime this late summer/fall) that it’s starting to feel a tad overwhelming. I got hired to work external audit at an AC and besides having no idea what exactly I’ll be doing, I’m curious as to what the hours are there at the AC compared to the horror stories you hear. While I said that I’d would be open to working hybrid, I also wonder if I’m going to be the only one with the majority of people still working from home. I don’t mind going in, but if no one else is there, it seems like an added expense and waste of travel time. I’m hoping to start getting more information once the summer interns are placed but it’s been fairly quiet."

**Final Thoughts:**

I'm obviously a little bummed that I wasn't accepted (or even waitlisted) by any of the HYPSM, but I'm still overjoyed at the great schools I was accepted into!

It's interesting that my college results seem to go against the idea that college decisions are predominately up to chance at top schools. I was rejected from the T5 (HYPSM) schools but accepted by most schools that fell just outside that range of selectivity. I think my biggest weakness was my lack of any state or national-level extracurriculars... or maybe my dice just happened to fall like this, I guess we'll never know.

Choosing a school to attend will be very difficult. Right now, I'm torn between Georgetown SFS for international politics, Duke, UPenn, Brown, and Johns Hopkins. Any suggestions would be great!!

PS - You better believe I got a bomb youtube video out of these decisions haha. Working on editing it now."

I have received an admit for Professional Masters Program ECE at UW Madison (16 months, 30 credits accelerated). I also have admits from Virginia Tech MS Non-Thesis Computer Engineering and NCSU MS Computer Engineering. My area of interest is primarily Embedded Systems and FPGA based design. I am an international student.

I am unsure about accepting the offer from UW Madison due to the shorter course duration and if it would cause an issue if I do not receive an internship or job by the end of the 16 months. Additionally, I am would like to confirm if it is a better choice for my area of interest.

Request advice on which program would be best, please. Thank you."
tw4pmw,0,2022-04-04,How do you know if you are meant to be a programmer?,HelloWorldNewbie,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tw4pmw/how_do_you_know_if_you_are_meant_to_be_a/,"Hi,

I studied advertising in my country but for personal reasons I moved to another country, where my degree was worth nothing. I did some interim jobs, but I wanted to achieve more in my professional life so last year I attended a bootcamp for web development, I learned the basics of JS,HTML, CSS and PHP, it was in a 6 months period. To be honest I don't even know how I finish it, it was always very challenging for me, always felt the last of the class and this factor has affected me on my self-esteem, I felt and feel like an idiot in a world of very smart people. After the training I got an internship in a big company and it again was very challenging, but with research and help I was able to deliver what was asked. After the internship I applied to a few jobs (didn't applied to many jobs because I'm also doing stuff to adapt to the new country, getting my drivers license right now).This IT journey really changed my life, I could  see a huge difference in the hiring process, to begin I was already getting interviews (before the training I didn't even get an interview) and I even got three offers. Anyway I work now with a start up that uses a low code platform and I'm not enjoying it at all, I miss the structure of OOP for example, the infinity of resources you can find online when you are blocked. So it made me feel : ""ok, seems I do like coding"" but my fear of me sucking at it makes wonder if this is really something for me. Because I'm really not good at it, it's already a year since I began this journey and still  haven't created any code from my own, you know there's people that with help of tutorials or stuff like that create a game or something, well I haven't, the only things I have done is little stuff work related, like JS,HTML and CSS components to use in the low code platforms. I take like 2 weeks to create a progress ring and most of it was thanks to stack overflow, I reuse a lot of available code there to achieve my goals and sometimes the result is not 100% functional. You could say, practice on your free time, but since I am still ""adapting"" to this new country, having some time off is something I really look forward to have some rest. So I don't know , if I'm actually meant to be a programmer. How do you guys know you are in the right path?"

I am in a 2 year program to learn programming (supposed to be equivalent to a bachelors but it's classified as a higher vocational degree). The selling point of these programs are 

1. The industry designs the curriculum 
2. They include 18 weeks of internship where you are at an actual company.

Now the first 6 week internship is rapidly approaching and 1/3 of the class don't have internships positions. This includes me. So far I have gotten the highest possible grades on all coursework while working almost full time. The local companies are crying their eyes out about their shortage of devs but when I call them about internship positions all I get is that they just can't offer it at the current time. I am wondering if it's worth continuing with the program. All I hear is that my CV must be trash or that I must be trash since I can't even get an interview. What do you thing?"
tw6d4s,1,2022-04-04,Need advice,assgaurdian21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tw6d4s/need_advice/,"I am an international MSCS student in USA (Chicago) currently in my second semester. I have no work experience. I wanted to do an internship this summer to get some experience but unfortunately, I couldn't get one yet. I have been working hard this semester, doing leetcode every day and am able to solve most medium level questions given some time. I also have some full stack development knowledge and know ReactJS well. I applied for various internships but didn't hear back.

I have taken an education loan which will become hard to repay if I don't get a job. It seems unlikely that I'll get an internship this summer given the requirements of work authorization in this time frame, and it has taken a toll on me. From the past few days, I have been feeling really low and having thoughts of going back to my country as a lot of people around me got internships who were not very good at coding but had work experience. I am having trouble focusing on my assignments and feeling really frustrated. 

I feel it's going to be really hard to find a fulltime job with no work experience. So, I need some advice on what I should do to maximize my chances of getting a job. I'll have 3 months of summer vacation and then 2 semesters before I have to get a job. I am ready to give my all if I just knew what I have to do.

Edit: 
I applied to around 100 companies, got 3 interviews. Rarely, I got coding tests so I am getting rejected based on my resume. 
I recently got waitlisted by Amazon.

tw6xhj,40,2022-04-04,"Friend messed up and applied to only top programs, got rejected by all",1_b3,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tw6xhj/friend_messed_up_and_applied_to_only_top_programs/,"As the title suggests, my friend applied to only top grad programs for CS and she ended up getting rejected by all. She's gone offline from all social media apps and switched off her phone from 3 days ever since she got the Georgia Tech reject which was the only decision pending. She's been rejected by CMU, UCB, Stanford, Harvard, UCSD, UCLA. 

Before she started applying I advised her to be realistic and apply to few moderate universities as well and was being honest like a true friend that her profile might not necessarily get into top programs considering our college isn't even Tier 2 in India and that she had better odds to pull off a Top 10/20 admit easily. She thought that since she had a great GRE score (323) and GPA (9/10), any school would want her and looked down on schools like UW Madison, UMass Amherst or Purdue, which are amazing as well. She has absolutely zero research experience but expressed that she wants to work at these research labs at these top universities. Her SOP didn't align with her profile and interests. She even rejected an offer from an MNC for a SDE role citing that she needs time to apply and prepare for her graduate program and that her parents will fund her application fee and studies if required. I told her I'll support her regardless if she's confident about getting in and if not that she could always apply for the next cycle.

After the application process was done, she hasn't got a call from even the smallest of start-ups and is struggling to find a job or an internship. The weight of rejections from her top choices and companies has weighed her down one at a time. She's one of the few people from University who isn't working nor has an admit even after a year of graduating.

She's been socially distant ever since her first reject and has now gone to the cave. Of course now she will apply to Spring 23' as I know she wouldn't give up, but just letting you guys know that choose your universities wisely if you really want to go and not apply to show-off that you're ambitious and only apply to top universities. Everybody would be ambitious given a choice, who wouldn't want to go to the top programs for CS. Sure, it's an individual choice to apply and wanting to go to specific programs but not doing anything in the meantime that'll gradually improve your profile for the next cycle at the pretext of being over-ambitious over your current decisions isn't the way to go. Not everyone is financially privileged like my friend, choose to spend your application fee with great consideration.

This was a small lesson that I learnt which I thought I'd share.

Good luck to all for the next cycle."

Uwash pros- In the city, beautiful campus, directly admitted into major, great opportunities to do internships at big tech companies, very diverse 

Cons- Far from home, bad weather, not very good social life, everyone says they hate it there, very competitive, might not get into actual human computer design engineer program (i want to become a ux designer) 

Vtech pros- Closer to home, great campus food, beautiful campus, nice weather 

Vtech cons- Not near a city, in the farm area, not very diverse, uwash has better engineering program

tw814p,2,2022-04-04,My former online FWB: One year later,Bigbuckrocks,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/tw814p/my_former_online_fwb_one_year_later/,"On April 3, 2021, I sent my last message and officially ceased all contact with somebody who I had a deep connection with, but whose behavior ended up being detrimental to my mental health. It wasn’t a romantic relationship, but we did meet because of something that we both find sexually arousing. That was one reason it became toxic, but other toxic behaviors that ultimately led to me cutting her off were: giving me mixed signals (while she had a boyfriend, who she actually met while we were still talking to each other), flirting with me, sending me lots of (non-sexual) pictures of herself, and expressing jealousy while I was talking to someone else to try and get my mind off of her (and yes I now realize that me doing this wasn’t fair for the other person).

Measures I took to cleanse her out of my life included: blocking her on just about every social media platform we talked on (I also blocked a few other people she was associated with even if I never spoke to them), deleting all conversations (as well as any screenshots and screen recordings of them), deleting any comments she might have made on my posts, removing her name wherever it might have showed up on my posts, and basically purging everything related to her across every single device. This was an entirely online thing. Because of the long distance between us, as well as COVID, we never met in person.

Once I cut off contact I was finally able to gain control of my life and stop the madness I went through. My life started to change for the better.

I got vaccinated against COVID-19. My first jab actually happened just hours after I cut off contact with her. I finished my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and had my graduation ceremony a few months later. I went to Universal Orlando &amp; Disney World with my mother to celebrate. I started an internship at a company, which eventually turned into my current job. I met up with old friends, and made new ones. I attended a big historical carousel tour for the first time ever, and I have been into antique carousels for just about my whole life. I improved on my best finish in an annual gaming tournament that I have been competing in since 2016 and made more cash money than before. And finally, I moved into an apartment on my own for the first time and have been learning independence.

Despite all these great things happening to me, I did have some trauma to deal with as a result of going through this mess, and I adopted some coping mechanisms, some of which were kind of expensive. I talked to people about the situation, sometimes a little more than I probably should have (I did have a therapist and still do), and I also did online phone sex (although I’m trying to stop this), because it sometimes reminds me of what my ex-FWB and I had with each other. I started growing a beard, but it may have been subconscious because her boyfriend also has a beard. I did start watching one show that she liked (Friends, although it is popular) and gave up old ones I enjoyed but got tired of (like SpongeBob). I did play arcade games in my apartment, but sometimes I felt over-reliant on them. I have occasionally looked her up on Facebook to see if other people posted pictures of her, but I stopped doing this too. As for the fetish she and I both had, I seem to have lost it because I think about her every time I try to get aroused by it, and I don’t want that.

It’s officially been over a year, and I feel my priorities are shifting now. Work keeps me busy, and I occasionally hang out with other people. But she still occasionally comes into my head, and I feel a sense of dread at the thought of physically being in the area where she lives (I don’t live near her, which is good). This is one reason I stopped going to my local Six Flags park every summer, but there were other reasons that I made this decision long before I met her.

I’m not sure about meeting others because I don’t know if they are going to do the same thing this person did to me. This is one reason I haven’t really been trying to meet new people lately in a romantic sense. I don’t really feel ready for something like that anyway right now."

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*The part of my app I was probably most insecure about*

1. Engineering Project (this was my main engineering EC outside of my school’s program) - led a team creating a solar-powered irrigation management system which informed impoverished farmers of the irrigation potential of their land based off of soil data. I feel like this was the EC that best showed the story I told in my whole application, which was my desire to use mechanical engineering to serve communities in need.
2. Ethnic Advoacy —&gt; this was my longest-lasting EC (all four years) and, along with the letter of rec from my ethnic metnor, I felt showed the span of my community service/advocacy? Planned multiple protests with 200-300+ attendees, organized national social media/graphics efforts for awareness, created paintings/art pieces to fundraise $1,000+, etc etc (it’s a lot of oddball tasks as well)
3. Social Justice Club Founder/President - coordinated Q&amp;A meetings with guest speakers from local organizations across various issues, planned donation drives with 500-800 items donated, hosted roundtable discussions, and basic presidential responsiblities
4. Environmental Justice Nonprofit - Team lead, so I led a group of volunteers from various ages doing different educational/informational projects, organized meetings, found and led a new inititative to increase high school participation in our city by creating campus clubs at various high schools
5. ASB Historian - oversaw 70+ representatives, in charge of school’s Instagram, planned school-wide events, yada yada
6. Elementary School Paid Internship - basically a summer job
7. City Intern - selected from 100/700, explored the inner workings of the city by hearing from various leaders (congress rep, police chief, etc)
8. High School Mentorship Program - lead mentoring sessions for 20 students over the summer 
9. Combined some ethnic advocacy groups I worked in —&gt; mostly did research for social media campaigns on outreach teams; was secretary for a local chapter of an international ethnic organization, planning local community events and other things
10. Smaller EC but mentioned that I planed a college admissions seminar for 100+ students in need, coordinated with AOs, SAT/ACT prep ppl, teachers, etc 

Misc - planned to do research on energy systems with a college professor but cancelled b/c of Covid, noted it on my apps

**Awards/Honors**

*Disclaimer - I had like none of these because most of my activities didn’t have awards associated to them and I also didn’t realize the need for getting awards…*

1. AP Scholar
2. Various Community Service awards (misc)
3. MESA Day - Local (Silver)
4. MESA Day - Regional (Bronze)
5. School Academic Awards (4.0+ GPA, Student Athlete, etc)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Freshmen English Teacher — also my current club advisor and have stayed close over the last four years, probably 9.5/10?

Engineering Teacher - had him for three years and could testify to my growth in the engineering environment, 8/10

Counselor - new to the job right when COVID hit but stayed in touch and always made an effort to reach out, 7/10

Additional: Ethnic Advocacy Mentor - has seen the growth of my advocacy work over the last four years and can speak to what I’m passionte about, solid 11/10 (I chose to include an additional letter of rec because although my teachers could testify to my academic success, they did not know as much about my advocacy work, and I felt like that was an important part of my app)

**Interviews**

MIT - although they hadn’t attended since the 70s, they were super cool and had the best stories from their time there. Dived deep into what I did and allowed me to speak as long as I needed (7/10)

Dartmouth - first interview so I was nervous but interviewer said I had the best why us response they’ve heard, also was younger in age so easier to connect to and pursued my major for a similar goal that I have (8/10)

Harvard - very chill interviewer and an easy-going conversation, lasted the longest out of all three and they genuinely enjoyed everything I had to say. In contrast to the other interviewers, he mostly tried to gauge WHY I do what I do instead of just what I do (all that info is already on my apps), which made it much more interesting (10/10)

**Essays**

I think this is where my apps were stronger. I did procastinate some of my essays lol, but I think my writing skills saved me. Common app was about my name (I have like 9 names) and I talked about the importance of names in my culture and how they tell the lives lived and lessons learned of those who came before me. I then took three of my names (one means traditions, another means personal growth, and the last translates to giving thanks, which I interpreted as service) and connected them to experiences I’ve had throughout life and described how each name has guided what I do (EC’s) and will continue to guide what I do (future major). I also connected those names back to the ancestors before me who had that name, and showed how what I do now is a reflection of what they did, and how when I am gone, my experiences will be added to the ancestrial storyline that has existed long before me and will continue to exist after my time. This was literally so fun to write which made it much easier to do instead of trying to push my narrative into a box.

My Columbia supplementals were my favorite to write, as the prompts allowed me to reveal many different sides of myself. My best was probably the one about how i learn from and contribute to diverse communities, I talked about the role of storytelling in my ethnic community and how I utilize the lessons learned from their experiences to engage in better efforts for the advocacy work I pursue, and that at Columbia, I will immerse myself in the stories of others, learning from their history to create a more interconnected student body dedicated to learning through others. :D

I kind of just had fun with the optional Harvard supplement and did the list of books since I’m a major bookworm. I began by describing the covers of all these worn books I have and the story behind them and what each one has taught me, with a mix of fiction and non-fiction. I think this helped show my intellectual curioisity?? and just my genuine interest to learn.

**Additional Information:**

I first went into the college app season fearful that I wouldn’t be sucessful because I never knew about the need to win big awards or do national science fairs, research, etc (I also think it was bc I never had any older family members who went through the college app experience in America or even knew these things existed and were available for people my age). Everything I did during high school was something I loved, and I think that’s why I was able to do well. Additionally, I feel like although I never got national awards or recognition, my activities all had a local and direct impact, and I think the colleges could see the bigger impact I could have after college (although I could be wrong lol). 

Another big factor in my college admissions journey was, unfortunately, my race. Although it’s literally 2022 and society has advanced, I was still very conscious of who I was and what my possible success would look like for some people, especially in a field/major that already has such an underrepresentation of those like me. It’s a sad reality I’ve already dealt with in the days following my acceptances, but nonethless I’ve had countless friends and teachers who have helped me realize that I deserve what I have reaped for all the hard work I’ve put in. If you are an URM out there, please do not let your accomplishments and the schools you get into be tarnished by those who can’t be happy for your success. &lt;33

Also please, please, PLEASE do not undermine your essays. I think that while my stats were good and my EC’s were nice, my essays were what really told my cohesive story and summarized who I was. Through the topics I chose and stories I conveyed, I feel like the readers could see WHY I do what I do, and how I want to pursue mechanical engineering to serve those around me. For any rising seniors, I would recommend that you try to find topics that will really help connect the various parts of your application instead of adding another random bit of yourself that will leave the AO confused. Good luck!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang Teacher - 6.5/10?? I did pretty okay in her class, but I wasn't outspoken at all. I think she somewhat liked me though (only submitted for MIT)

AP Chem Teacher - 8/10.. he got to see me grow a lot throughout my high school experience, so I think my recommendation from him was pretty good.

AP Calc AB Teacher (my school only offers math up to Calc AB) - 7/10 I was very involved in her class, and I also talked to her a lot about personal stuff sometimes.. she is kind of my therapist lol. (only submitted to colleges other than MIT)

Counselor - 8/10 he knew a lot about my familial situation and understood what i was going through throughout high school

**Interviews**

MIT - 5/10 this was my first interview, so i was very nervous and stumbled over my words often. however, i eventually got myself under control and managed to leave an impact with my taxidermy bird lol. he said at the end that he thought i would do great at MIT

Harvard - 3/10 not what i was expecting... he seemed to focus solely on my stats, and once i mentioned i was interested in cybersecurity, he asked whether the US should start a cyberwar against Russia??? couldn't muster up an intellectual response lmao. he also asked what other colleges i applied to, so i was honest.. yeah

Stanford - 5/10 i wasn't really prepared, and it was over the phone. he said i asked well-thought out questions, but that was the only positive feedback i received

Yale - 6/10 this interview was objectively my best one. i talked quite a bit about the unique things that drew me to yale :')

Princeton - 5/10 it was an average interview. even my interviewer told me that he would write about how i would do great at Princeton like most other interviewees he interviewed

**Essays**

MIT short essays - 8/10 I worked on my MIT essays for 3 straight weeks and reviewed them with my AP Lit and career counselor multiple times, so they were pretty high quality.

Common App Personal Statement - 8/10 my AP Lit teacher really helped me bring my story to life. i focused on how crochet was my safe space throughout my parents' divorce and how it led me to become self-driven. Then I drew parallels from crochet to VEX Robotics (somewhat cliche topics work ig)

RD short essays - 3-7/10 there was a lot of variability among them. My Harvard supplemental essays were complete garbage, but my Columbia ones were pretty good ig

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* 2 state schools w/ full-ride offers
* UMN Twin Cities - w/out honors or merit scholarships :(
* MIT EA deferred -&gt; RD accepted
* Columbia RD - received likely for C.P. Davis Scholar program

*Waitlists:*

* Princeton RD

*Rejections (oof lmao):*

* UC Berkeley
* UCLA
* USC - applied by merit scholarship deadline
* Harvard RD
* Yale RD
* Cornell RD
* Stanford RD

**Additional Information:**

I *rushed* all of my college applications (legit starting my supplemental essays the day they were due) except for MIT. That likely ruined my RD college apps."

common app essay theme was cliche, but I was still able to outline my most significant learning experience. 6/10

supps: pretty good in my opinion, depending on how vague or interesting prompts were. 7/10

Interviews: went well with Princeton, MIT, and UPenn, but interviews literally do not matter. 9/10

Every rejection stung hard despite knowing that I wouldn't get accepted to virtually all of my reaches. But I am now really happy (and got lucky) with where I am committing now. This process has taught me a lot, and so have people on this and A2C subreddits. As a prospective CS major, I feel behind but I am up for some action in college now! Good luck to y'all."
twgwev,5,2022-04-04,Career Pivot: Higher Education to MBA in Data Analytics Need Advice,Interesting_Survey28,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/twgwev/career_pivot_higher_education_to_mba_in_data/,"Hello!

I am new here!

I have a BA in Political Science along with an M.Ed. in Higher Education Administration. Currently, I work as an Assistant Director of International Admissions for a small, private institution in the Midwest. I have been in this role for almost 2 years. I oversee all undergraduate international admissions and report directly to one of our VPs, a member of the university cabinet. I am responsible for all international applications, credential evaluations, recruitment, strategic planning, partnership contracting, reporting, some marketing, and more. I do not oversee other employees with the exception of a student intern.

Prior to this, I worked and lived in China for 5 years as a teacher and curriculum coordinator for two international high school programs. While I enjoy my career, feel it is challenging, and have exceeded all my expectations, my compensation is under 50k per year, there only ever a few open job opportunities available in the entire state of Ohio, and advancement opportunities at my current institution are essentially non-existent and require far more work than what is reasonable given the pay. Currently, I have to work a 2nd job as a delivery driver just to meet my monthly expenses each month and realize this career path is not sustainable.

Luckily, I was able to enroll in my institution's MBA program for free as an employee. I have chosen the Data Analytics Track, and am hoping this can help me make a pivot to a more financially rewarding career. As many on this sub-reddit are looking to land a career making $100K straight out of their MBA, I would be thrilled making more than $50k per year (keep in mind I am in Ohio with a much lower cost of living, my current career would pay $60-70k in California, for example). Just to be able to save some money and be able to purchase a home one day would make me happy.

I take one course every 8 weeks and am currently in my 3rd course, projected to finish in another 1.5 years.  I plan to supplement my MBA in Data Analytics with some SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableu. I'll be using Datacamp's modules on SQL and Python. Would this be enough to land an entry-level position making more than $50k per year? Are there any suggestions you have? Frankly, I have no issue starting entry-level. I am not sure I have the required communication, interviewing or presenting skills to demand a higher level position quite yet - I feel I still need to earn my way.

I am also on the look out for mentors. Thank you in advance for any support you are able to provide."

Software Engineering major (CGPA 3.74 /4.00). GRE: 309 (160 Q, 149 V, 4.5 AWA).

I will be graduating in June 2022.

I have 1 deep learning research internship and 1 software development industrial internship. I also have 2 glowing LORs.

I applied to UTD, Masters in Business Analytics (Data Science) at the Naveen Jindal School of Management for regular decision. I submitted the application on 15th March which was the last date for RD, and recommendations submitted a week after that.

Just wanted to inquire about my chances. Should I remain hopeful, or expect a reject?"

I just applied for the PSYC 116 sequence but I'm a little nervous about getting in. I'm worried they won't accept me but I'm not sure.

My stats/research experience: 3.3 GPA (aiming for 3.5+ in the upcoming quarters), currently finishing up my second round of PSYC 199 credit, have worked in a psychology lab for almost a full school year and have experience with literature searching, I'm a McNair scholar and will be doing 40 hr weeks during the summer mostly dedicated to research, currently writing my own research proposal that will develop into a collaborative study next year, I'm certified to work with human subjects, and will soon start sitting in on qualitative interviews and doing coding for a public health research project I volunteered for. Next year there's the possibility of me working with some other public health researchers based in SD/TJ, and also volunteering for a local grassroots org that promotes safe sex and overdose prevention. I also plan on applying for a NIDA internship that'll take place in 2023.

I know that sounds like a lot, but does the PSYC 116 sequence prioritize those with a lot of research experience, or does it prioritize those who need research experience and haven't gotten it yet? I really really want to get in. orz

Thank you! :)"

Other?",TwoGate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/twibk2/entering_my_junior_year_with_no_summer_plans_no/,"So far, I have been unable to find an internship position for this summer. However, I would still like to do something constructive for my resume and improve my chances of finding an internship next summer and subsequently a job after college in the case that I do not manage to get an internship offer now.

Some things I have considered include working solely on side projects and building a portfolio to better showcase my skills as a developer, study intensely for DSA questions, or possibly join a BootCamp for a more structured Summer. Ideally, I would like to put something on my resume as I accutely lack job experience.

About me: I'm a student studying Cog Sci. I tanked my GPA during Corona to be in 3.0-3.5 GPA range. I have a 30hr+ a week commitment as a student-athlete that has limited me from student jobs on campus and in the amount of time I can invest in internship search. My technical background mainly comes from being a self-taught fullstack developer since high school. I did contribute to multiple open source organizations in high school but my cscareer related work since then has been limited."

twjnac,0,2022-04-04,Realistic timeframe for learning code,BegginerSinner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/twjnac/realistic_timeframe_for_learning_code/,"Hi all,
Currently a 2nd year Finance and Econ student, disillusioned with finance industry, want to become swe.

In a month my semester ends, I'll have 2 months off and another 6 months working as an ops analyst at SIG, where I'll be using Python, SQL and VBA daily.

I'm planning to use those six months to learn a few programming languages. Don't mind putting in long hours as code fascinates me and from experience I cam stay up all night feeding curiosity and poking around with it, but to be safe, let's say 2 hours per day.

My plan is:
-First two months: Advanced Python (I'd say I know intermediate python currently)
-Next three months: Intermediate JavaScript from scratch.
-Last three months: Intermediate C++ from scratch.

At the end of eight months, I should be at least Intermediate in Python, SQL, VBA, JS and C++

As side projects I plan on taking up a quant trader role at my university's student investment fund and developing a midsize mobile game with my cousin.

I then plan to use all that to get a SWE internship that doesn't require CS/STEM background (E.g. Deloitte), if that doesn't work, I'll do a Cs conversion course.

Since I'm quite new in exploring the tech industry, I have a few questions:

-Would this be a realistic time horizon?
-Should I focus on other languages instead? 
-Should I focus more on projects rather than learning languages for the sake of it?
-Should I learn multiple at a time or work through them one-by-one?
-Any general advice for me?"

But recently, I started really disliking it: 
1- I don't see any meaning on the work that I do, as we make stuff to stores to showcase new fragances from big brands ( my work is just to make someone spend money on a new fragance); 
2-I did not get along with people there very well, as Im kind of shy and in the 6 months there I only made a single friend (I only interact with other employees as a  coworker); 
3- I get really stressed out daily  and almost everyday im complaining something that happened there with my friends; 

4- Im about to graduate from college and currently doing my final project/thesis.

What keeps me there:
 1-The salary; 
2-It's my first job and the market here in brazil is pretty bad nowadays ( there were few jobs for industrial designers and now they are almost non- existant); 

3- (The big deal) At least I socialize with other people:  I think it would be bad for me to stay at home most of time ( i live alone) as most of my friends  live in my hometown that is  3hours away (so only on weekends that i could go there). My only other possible  ""human interactions here:  Visiting my sister and nieces; theater classes on thursdays. I recently started talking again with some friends from college, as I lost contact with them during the pandemic.

4- Are my complaints valid or its me that still not really adjusted to ""adult life"" (Im 22 by the way)?


Do you guys have any tips for me?"

I’ll try to make it short. I’ve (F29) been on work from home for 2 years. At first it was my old job (not so bad, I knew everyone from the office because I’ve worked there for 3 years).

Tomorrow is my FIRST DAY IN THE OFFICE.

I’m going to lose it. I’m working for the gouvernement now and I’ve never worked in that kind of environment. I’m one of the only new people because they stopped most of the hire during the pandemic. So they all know each other besides me. I know all the people ONLY from internet calls and emails. I can’t believe I’m going to meet them ALL at the same time tomorrow.

twml3a,29,2022-04-05,Georgia Tech vs Brown,Luke_7N,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/twml3a/georgia_tech_vs_brown/,"I have been fortunate enough to get into both colleges this year and am now debating which would be the better option for me. I plan on majoring in CS for both but I have a big interest in computational biology as a more specialized field that I’d want to work in that also keeps the door open for an MD which I’m also considering. (Sorry for the horrible formatting; I’m writing this on mobile at midnight on a whim).

-Pros for Tech

I am instate for Tech so I would benefit from Zell Miller and go to Tech tuition free which is the biggest draw but I’d still have to pay room and board and every other expense which comes out to around 15-20k per year. Georgia Tech is obviously a great and renown CS program in Atlanta which is still growing as many big tech companies move into the area. Great coop programs also open the door to more internships and thus job opportunities. I’m familiar with the area, have a good base of friends I already know would be going to Tech and would be less than an hour from home.

-Cons for Tech

They only have a graduate program for computational biology and I don’t know how accessible they will be as an undergrad.
Georgia Tech is notoriously known for a difficult grading system and grade deflation which wouldn’t matter much for a pure CS degree but if I did decide on pursuing med school then it would make it more difficult.
Even though I listed it as a pro I can see staying in Georgia and not getting a fresh start as a con as well.

-Pros for Brown

More balanced and manageable course load with the open curriculum and more time to work on research and looking for internships outright.
Smaller program where it isn’t the premier major which means a closer relationship with faculty and hopefully more chances to do research. 
A computational bio undergrad degree is offered if I want to fully commit to it but even if I don’t the concentration and classes are available to undergrads
The ivy reputation and the more forgiving grading system will make med school much more achievable if that’s what I want to do.
A fresh start far from Georgia 

-Cons for Brown
My current financial aid offer would make the school economically infeasible however there has been a big change in income in my household and I’ve already called and appealed and their financial aid office has told me that an updated offer is in the process of being worked on.
A “worse” reputation for CS but the bar is set very high with Tech and I feel at these top schools they all have similar tools to succeed.
A fresh start that’s far from family and friends (I’m still on the fence about this part if you couldn’t tell).

That’s really my main breakdown between the two schools and if the financial aid is comparable than at this point I’m leaning towards Brown pretty heavily but that’s a big if. I’d love any opinions or feedback on what I’ve said though just to get more views on my situation or if someone were a student at either how they have been doing. Thanks for reading it all. It’s a big decision and I need all the help I can get."

She and I have a tight relationship and I did extraordinarily well in her class—I’d rate it a 9.5/10. My calculus teacher wrote my other academic rec, and again we got along really well and I did really well in her class—8.5/10. My college counselor wrote my counselor rec, and he and I are top tier buds—10/10.

**Interviews**

Nah I literally don’t remember any of them… they were decent, I think. I had EA interviews for each school that offered them (MIT and Case Western), and I’ve done RD interviews whenever offered (Carleton, Grinnell, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Harvey Mudd, URochester). I did not get an interview for Columbia.

**Essays**

I think my essays are really, really strong. My CA personal statement discussed how I’ve explored different aspects of my identity (namely socioeconomic status and sexuality) through shitty fashion; I think it displayed who I am (not only these named identifiers but also personality) very effectively. I also believe my supplemental essays were good. My college counselor is using them as examples for future students.

*Acceptances:*

* Indiana University (CS, $11k/yr merit)
* Purdue University (CS)

*Rejections:*

**Additional Information:**

I started out high school very shaky. Right at the end of the first semester of my freshman year, my mom attempted suicide in front of me. My dad took custody of me (they divorced when I was 4) and I moved halfway across the state. She bounced in and out of jail that year. During my sophomore year, she jumped out of a window and broke three parts of her spine, landing her in a medically-induced coma. This same year, I applied to boarding schools and ended up repeating my sophomore year of high school voluntarily due to the educational gap between my past low-income high school and my new school. During my second sophomore year, she was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18 months on house arrest. I don’t want to victimize myself in any way, and I don’t want sympathy, but these events heavily impacted my academics in high school.

**Reflections:**

My advice to everyone going through the app process is to not be afraid to be a fucking mega dork in your application. I wrote about fucking Naruto and robotics whenever I could, and I got some damn good results.

Also, prioritize being a good, interesting person above stats or grinding for ECs and shit. I’d wager that I got into many of my schools because of my recs and essays. Similarly, I got many of my ECs (namely captain of teams, club leadership, and internship) by just being sociable and getting to know people. I’m never the smartest person in a room—that’s okay. It’s okay to not be the smartest in the room. But try to be the funniest.

I don’t know. Don’t take my advice. I’m 19 and stupid as fuck. Do what feels right to you!

twns5j,2,2022-04-05,Should I quit (or ask for reduced hours) and “follow my passion”?,moodyjenna,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/twns5j/should_i_quit_or_ask_for_reduced_hours_and_follow/,"Hi all, I’ve been working full time while going to school online full time for my masters degree. I’m lucky and don’t have any student debt because I work but there are some real trade offs and I often want to dedicate more time to my studies and professional development. I love what I study and couldn’t have chosen a better program. 

However, my job is remote, I have a boss who trusts me and we have a great relationship. I get really good exposure into business operations and am respected on the team. But…I’m looking to pursue UX and am currently working in an unrelated administrative position that I’m quickly losing/LOST interest in. No matter the lack of interest, a strength of mine is I always try to put 100% into what I do including my work. I do long to dedicate more time to my future career in UX though. I would consider myself semi disengaged at work and not necessarily enjoying myself, but I’m very loyal which makes moving on really hard. 

My last semester is coming up and my mom recently offered to loan me up to 20k if I need it to finish school (with no interest once I start to pay her back). Timeline for paying back is extremely reasonable. 

I’ve always been told not to quit my job, but this way of learning can be very uncomfortable, and I’m tired. 

There was a consulting project with a big name client I would have the opportunity to work with but I know it won’t feasible with a 16 hour per week UX internship next semester, UX course and a 40+ hour per week job. 

In a perfect world, I would love cut down on my hours and work 32 hours per week so that I can take on this consulting project with the help of an interest free loan from my mom. That way I can still live really comfortably. Even with my strong relationship with my boss, I know if I bring this up with him, he could very well replace me with someone who can work more hours. Is there any way to approach this topic well? Do you think it’s possible he might be understanding?  Do any of you have experience in a similar situation? I have ideas on how I could cut down on my hours already that are cost efficient as I could train lower level employees to do a few. The last couple months have not been the easiest financially for the company so maybe they would be happy to save some money. 

Any advice to approach this topic thoughtfully is SO VERY appreciated. I think bringing up via email is better so he has time to think but also might not be best idea to have in writing initially. We do meet and talk pretty much every day but I don’t want to surprise him and am not sure how he will react. 

Thanks for reading and getting this far 🤣 appreciate you all!"

Offer 1: Front end portal work with Node,React, postgreSql, yarn, etc

Offer 2: embedded developer, C++ with some FPGA work too.

My degree is in computer engineering, graduating may, and I had an internship in web development which was only CSS and HTMl and Drupal, web security, therefore I feel I didn't get fully exposed to web development. My internship was boring to me but I also did a good it of fluff in that role, but in general it wasn't that stimulating. 

For option 1: the pay is 77k, 35 hour work weeks, remote and I met some of the people and liked them. I'm not sure if I'll be bored or if the job would be a good way to start my career/provide other opportunities in the future. This company is known for having a strong work life balance, and would give me free time (which I haven't really had throughout my degree)

For option 2: the pay is 95k, and I would need to relocate, +5k sign on bonus, +5k relocation. I know from school I like working with embedded and fpgas. This company is huge so they don't even know what project I'd be working on. So I have no idea the extent of the hours but it's at least 40 per week. Since I don't know the project or therefore the exact place I'd relocate to it's more of a shot in the dark. Reviews on Glassdoor generally said the work was interesting.

I'm leaning towards the first job mostly for the work life balance and lack of relocating. But I'm conflicted and not sure what opportunities it will lead me to. If I relocate I'd probably move for 18 months then move back. I'm more of an introvert so with relocating I'm slightly worried about being too isolated or struggling to meet people if I work extreme hours.


Any advice would be appreciated

My aim is to secure a **Data Science/ ML role** at a major software company (FAANGs do entice me a lot). I am confused about choosing between the two programs and even more so as the acceptance deadline is nearing. 

I love working in the Data Science space, all of my past internships have been in Data Science. NYU's DS program is really reputed and will assist me in going in the same direction. The faculty is top notch and the curriculum looks amazing too. 
The problems with NY are the cold weather which I'm not great with, the costs, and the possibility of limited job opportunities in comparison to the other.

On the other hand, UCSD's MS in CS program comes in the top 10-11 CS programs in the US. It does have the option of selecting subjects from AI Depth though most subjects will still be CS related. (Curriculum is a disadvantage here). The cost and weather are two major factors that are pulling me towards this program. There's also more RA and TAship opportunities at UCSD as compared to those in NYU. 

I've seen that there are more start ups at NYU and more software companies at UCSD. Also, about half of the Data roles are reserved for PhDs whereas there are a lot of CS jobs available so I'm also concerned if I will limit my role options on going to a DS specific program. I've heard from seniors that it is easier to get DS roles for CS folks than the other way round. I would prioritise getting a Data Science role over a SWE role. 

PS. I would love to get some inputs regarding the same and **your reasoning for choosing one over the other**.

My situation is not very common.

I am a computer science student in a California State University (US), but I am from Spain. I am in the US studying and I will go back to Europe after completing my bachelor’s degree.

Due to mistakes that were made when I was a minor, I became undocumented in the US, which made it nearly impossible for me to get an internship while I complete my degree.

I will finish my degree in Spring 2022 and I have very good grades, but due to other circumstances, I will not move back to Spain until Summer 2023.

I heard from several friends in Spain that it’s difficult to get a job, although they are not in the software field. But that combined with the fact that I couldn’t get an internship makes me worried that it will be very difficult to land my first job.

I am willing to move within the EU for a job in the long term, but at first I would like to live in Madrid, or another city in Spain.

How hard will it be to get my first job and what can I do to give myself the best chance once I arrive in Spain?

I'm looking to make a virtual study group with one or two people to study operating systems with over the summer. Preferably someone who can has an internship or something else going on during the week so we can sync up on the weekends. I dont go to Penn state so I would have a hard time finding a study group.

Also would be interested in a tutor- either a grad student or someone who got an A in cs473. 15-20$ per hour."

twu56x,138,2022-04-05,"Sudden feelings of inadequacy, feeling lost in programming even though I spent 6+ months",Short-Parsnip-6930,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/twu56x/sudden_feelings_of_inadequacy_feeling_lost_in/,"I quit my last job about 6 months to learn programming full-time, roughly 8 hours a day. It's all that's on my mind, day in and day out. I took a couple short breaks during my studies. I started with online intro courses to programming, now I am roughly 80% through The Odin Project, currently working on a project that builds an entire (extremely basic) web page through webpack and makes all the HTML elements of the page through Javascript. Soon I will be learning React.js. I sleep during the day, code and learn at night, eat a couple times a day. It's all I did for 6 months. Even stopped dating or going out and all that for my potential future.

I have burned through most of my savings and will need to start working soon to be able to eat, likely within the next month or two, and hopefully it's a developer job.

Yet, I still find myself struggling with the basic of basic concepts. Just the other day I forgot the proper syntax to an if else statement in Javascript and had to look it up even though I've literally been doing it for 6 months. I keep messing up rather basic things that I *know* I already learned in foundational courses. I can't even solve most of the easy leetcode questions unless I've seen and memorized them before, and my mathematics/algorithm skills are god awful. The only thing I have any semblance of confidence in is HTML and CSS because I spent like a month straight messing with grid and flexbox in CSS.

I am looking at job postings for junior web dev positions and even internships, and I don't think I truly have the skills the employers are looking for. Many are asking for back-end stuff and Java which I don't have a goddamn clue about. I don't have a degree, I only have the projects I have built so far from scratch which are ""meh"" at best and an experienced programmer will know it's just beginner-level stuff, so why would they ever even consider hiring me? I honestly don't even know what I can bring to the table for a company unless they need a web page, and why would they pay me when they can pay some Indian dude on Fiverr for $20 to do the same thing? I look at the resumes of other entry-level programmers and they seem to know 100x more than I do, they even know multiple languages while I'm still struggling with Javascript.

Of course I'm able to learn new things, but it's hard with 0 income and I have no idea how I could convince a company of that. I enjoy programming, I enjoy the challenge, but now that money will be a factor I'm starting to panic and I'm not sure if I'll be hire-able now or ever. I have 3 friends working as programmers - 2 of them got in directly through their familial connections, and the other one has roughly 40+ IQ points on me. Everyone else that I see that got their foot through the door was either really really good, had degrees, or had connections which I don't have. Should I even try applying to jobs? Any advice would be appreciated."

It's even more competitive at big tech companies where people spend weeks or months preparing for technical interviews. There are even consulting agencies to prep you.

Every job listing have absurd requirements in terms of experience or skill set, even for fresh grads. For SWE positions, knowing one or two programming languages isn't enough. The general expectation is that you're familiar with most common frameworks and will need minimal training. 

Graduate and medical school has never been tougher either. Candidates are more competitive than ever before. Having a publication from undergrad used to be rare, now it's an expectation at every top program. 

Internships are no different. With everyone desperate for work experience, summer internships are extremely cut throat. And it's getting worse.

I no longer like coding software but from the first day I have always loved the system admin, network and the devops side of things. I have cracked this job by clearing its coding rounds and this is a product based company similar to faang.

twvlqb,4,2022-04-05,As of yesterday I'm rocking a 100% admit rate! Help me pick an interdisciplinary arts and technology program!,thisaccountreeks,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/twvlqb/as_of_yesterday_im_rocking_a_100_admit_rate_help/,"Program #1. Masters in Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon (ETC) 

Pros: 

The Program Itself: it's prestigious and churns out graduates who work at the same places I want to work. This is a terminal degree. 

The Facility: Amazing, it's like if Google Campus and Disneyland combined. I know I will love being there. 

Length: 2 year program with no thesis. 

Education: Project focused with the opportunity to work with real clients right away on interdisciplinary teams. 

The Faculty: Fantastic, from top to bottom. 

My Big Slimy Ego: Not to give to much away, but their first semester focuses on my very unique specialization, so I know I could be a rockstar in this graduating class. 

Cons: 

Pricetag: It's 100k for two years and I don't know about funding yet. I could potentially owe the government a lot of nickles. 

Work: The ETC will only sign off on working outside  10 hours a week, which would increase my loans. 

Location: I don't love Pittsburgh. I think I can learn to like it, and I can definitely tolerate it for two years, but Pitt is not my kinda town. The cold is fine, it's more the city layout/size. 

Specialization: I specifically want to study Themed Entertainment as it applies to themeparks. The ETC does allow you to specialize in that, but it's primary focus is game design. I have experience in game design and I am not opposed to learning it, but it is not what I want to study most. 


Program #2. Master of Science in Themed Entertainment at University of Central Florida

Pros: 

Price: It would be about 32k in tuition total, which is the only program I can totally afford, no sweat. 

Program: The program has a technical focus, which is something I was looking for. I have a ton of artistic experience and don't want to take a bunch of repeat classes. 

Faculty: Mostly adjunct, but they have some rockstars  on staff! 

Length: 2 years, no thesis. 

Location: I like Orlando and will probably have to end up moving there anyway. I don't love Orlando, but I do love being close to Disney and that's enough 😂

Time: Classes are at night, so I could work or intern during the day easily. 

Cons: 

Facility: The Themed Ent program takes over the UCF theatre building at night, so it does not have it's own home/facility. I feel like I'd be working out of a lot of coffee shops. 

Age: The program is very new, so new it doesn't have a graduating class yet. There are no statistics on post-grad job placement yet. 

Big Slimy Ego: I would be more in the middle of the pack in this program. It has a focus on studio art I would need to work really hard to develop in order to be a top student. 

Fabrication: This program is almost entirely theory and design, unlike at the ETC, I would be building anything other than my portfolio. 


Program #3 Masters of Fine Arts in Theatre, *Concentration in Themed Experience*, at the University of Central Florida

I have almost 100% disqualified this one but I'll do the exercise anyway for kicks. No repeats! 

Pros: 

Terminal: Theoretically this will allow me to teach, which is something I'm not super interested in, but it would be a nice fallback. 

Big Slimy Ego: I already have a theatre-adjacent degree so I could kind of rest on my laurels there.

Edit: I forgot there is also apperently an opportunity for funding I can apply for to the degree of 10k per year for the first two years. However that would only decrease my costs to 40kish. 

Cons: 

Actual Title: Since I already have a degree in theatre I am not looking for another one. The actual word ""theatre"" is a turn off. I'm looking to diversify my skills.

Length: 3 years with required thesis. 

Price: It would be about 70k in tuition, which is not quite as many nickles as CMU, but still LOTS OF NICKLES. 

Repetition: I've taken a lot of the required classes at the undergraduate level and I want to focus on learning new things, not solidifying old ones. 

Class Times: Some classes are during the day, so it could kneecap my ability to work.

twx569,26,2022-04-05,"To those that are feeling hopeless right now. Read my story, there is definitely light at the end of this.",IntroductionWeird278,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/twx569/to_those_that_are_feeling_hopeless_right_now_read/,"In the fall of 2018 I reached the lowest point in my academic career. I was taking on more than what I could chew, I was going through really tough family situations, I was getting terrible sleep, and I was performing poorly in my classes. Everyone around me knew that I was working hard but the hard work wasn’t equating to good results. I kept on wondering to myself why won’t things get better if I am trying my best and why is life throwing me so many curveballs. Over that entire past year I had to endure close family members either passing away or getting severely ill, and my family going through two natural disasters where I didn’t know for weeks if they were okay. This was the worst period of my life and it got worse when at the end of the Fall 2018 semester I failed one of the classes I had tried so hard to succeed in. My GPA plummeted to a 2.65 and I felt completely defeated. I had tried everything I possibly could to succeed but nothing was working and I wasn’t happy. That’s when I sat down with my parents and I told them something needed to change in my lifestyle. That change was prioritizing my mental health and scaling back from all of the academic and extracurricular commitments I was involved in. I started going to therapy, I took less credits the following semester, focused on my research and only on initiatives I truly cared about, and I started to get proper sleep. It was by doing these steps that I started to see a change in my performance but also my overall happiness and well-being. Things weren’t smooth sailing at first, that semester sadly my grandmother passed away, but changing my lifestyle to prioritize my mental health and take away any of the stigmas in my head about being a Latino and going to therapy really allowed me to better navigate hardship where I didn’t crash and burn academically again. I knew in my mind that these changes were working and I have to stay the course. Bringing down a GPA can be quick and swift, bringing up a GPA is an uphill battle. Taking on a more manageable class load allowed me time to excel in research where now I’ve grown so much as a researcher. I was able to do two phenomenal public health internships and in my own neuropharmacology lab I was able to contribute to meaningful projects in which 2 are now co-authored publications, 1 is in review, and I am currently working on a final publication in the lab before I graduate. Since then I’ve been able to maintain a semester GPA above a 3.7 and my cumulative GPA now sits at 3.27. With that newfound confidence I decided that I should give getting my PhD a shot. I ended up in this cycle applying to 16 programs in Neuroscience where I aim to work in Computational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering. After applying all I heard back was rejections after rejections and I started feeling a little hopeless. I decided that I needed a second plan just in case I get rejected from all my grad school apps. I applied to nearly 40 jobs where I was able to then secure a couple of interviews at consulting firms where now I have gone through the interview process and now have an offer doing healthcare consulting. In this time even though I thought hope was lost I ended up getting an interview request at a school I didn’t think I had a shot in, Georgetown University. I walked into the interview process thinking that no matter what happens this has already exceeded my expectations and this is a win no matter what. I started noticing that there was a strong fit between the faculty and me at these interviews but at the same time I didn’t want to get my hopes up. Now a couple of weeks later I have been accepted to Georgetown University doing a PhD in Neuroscience and I have also received a really solid healthcare consulting job offer on the table. I don’t say all of this as a brag, I say this to say to everyone going through a tough time in school, always keep your head up, it’s hard at times it definitely wasn’t easy for me but always believe in yourself and believe that things will get better. Prioritize your mental health, there should never be a stigma in getting help and seeking out therapy, if you are going through something in life, please get help. To everyone in an academic pit, you are not less than anyone else and never feel that way. It is definitely possible to get out of your tough academic situation, try to figure out what is and what isn’t working out in life and even if that requires a drastic lifestyle change than go do it. Don’t let anyone say to you that you can’t accomplish your goals and at the end of the day the only person that truly matters in saying you can or can’t accomplish your goals is yourself. Never lose hope, things definitely do get better but please always believe in yourself no matter what."

Ideally in the future I want to work in the finance sector as I doubt I can make it in the tech sector of computer science. I think the finance sector is still fairly lucrative but I'm not sure which one of these two to go into. I already accepted the offer from Freddie Mac but I'm thinking of reneging and came on here to see if anyone might know enough about the two to help me decide which one would look better on a resume if I am going into the finance sector for programming work in the future.

I made a list of pros and cons from the research I did so far:

M&amp;T Bank Pros:

* They're a bank and well known in my region (Delaware)
* They offered a little bit more in compensation for the summer
* Might be relevant to a career in banking in the future? (Biggest reason I want to switch here)
* Free time to learn what I want on the job
* Work with Java

M&amp;T Bank Cons:

* They're Forbes spot 444
* Relatively small bank
* I don't know if I'm guaranteed a software development role in their Technology Internship Program

Freddie Mac Pros

* They're letting me go remote
* They're a Forbes 50 company
* Bigger than M&amp;T, especially in terms of assets
* Work with Java
* Government backed

Freddie Mac Cons

* Not well known in my region
* Offered me a little less in compensation compared to M&amp;T

I know there might not be much of a difference but whichever is slightly better in terms of career prospects in the future, I will take. Also, if I go with M&amp;T, I will have to renege on Freddie Mac"
twzj95,1,2022-04-05,"Job that I really wanted just called for an interview. Problem is, I just started an internship.",Worldly_Procedure427,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/twzj95/job_that_i_really_wanted_just_called_for_an/,"A couple months ago I was doing some job hunting. I applied for a few different jobs and didn’t hear back from any for a while. 

A company reached out to me on indeed and offered me a remote full-time paid internship ($15/hr) as a marketing intern. They said it was only a 3 month internship with the possibility of a full time position. Since I was desperate for a job, I applied and didn’t hear back from them for a month. 

After assuming I wouldn’t get the internship, I ended up applying for a  part-time job as a kennel assistant at a pet clinic very close to where I live. I found them through Indeed but applied in person. Although I’m not really looking to go into the veterinary field, I do love animals and this is an entry-level position. This is also a part-time position which is great because I am also a full-time student. 

About a month after applying for the internship thinking they were no longer interested, they emailed me asking to do an interview. I said yes, did 2 different interviews and got the internship. I was ecstatic. 

I’m only about a month into my internship and I’m going to be honest, I’m not loving it. It’s a lot more work than I expected and I don’t feel like I’m learning anything. Plus working remotely from my bedroom is making me go a bit stir crazy. Also having to do school at the same time is leading me towards a mental breakdown. 

Today I got a call from the pet clinic, asking me to do an interview. It’s been almost 2 months since I applied and I think I would be much happier working at the pet clinic. 

Here’s my predicament: This internship is only 3 months and even if they offered me a full time position after it’s over, I don’t think I would take it. I’m really focused on getting my degree and feel a part-time position would be better for me mentally. I want to explain to the pet clinic that I would love to take the job, but that I wouldn’t be able to start until July. Should I mention this to them? They don’t seem to be “desperately hiring” so would they be willing to wait a couple more months? Or should I just quit the internship? I really need some advice here. Thank you!"

I've also thought about doing a job in India for 1-2 years first then go to America but I don't think I'll take this option unless it makes a game changing difference for my MS application. So how big of a difference does it make? I've heard that high CGPA is the most important one. And things like high GRE and TOEFL scores and internships. I've seen people mention having 2-4 research papers, CS related projects and hackathons as important as well. But I've rarely seen people mention work experience. So how big of a difference does it make? If I want to go to a good university (not ivy) would it make a big difference if I have job experience or is all the stuff mentioned above enough?

tl;dr I want to get out of a state of fear of the future and fear of change.   
I might finally get employment soon and I'm very very scared of not knowing how it'll work out.

I'm just your average student looking for an internship so that I can finally be done with college.

After struggling with life purpose and finding out management was not for me, I enrolled into liberal arts with a focus on translation, then got into publishing graduate school cause I thought it was the area I disliked the least and stood some chance of eventually enjoying.

All this to get to now - I've driven myself in a corner, psychologically. Right now, I'm only seeing bad outcomes - either 1) I don't find an employer in time and will have to find one later, maybe even starting next fall or 2) I DO find an employer and then next week I'll be doing my second internship.

My issue is 1) means more time spent unemployed unless I go out of my way to find something, while 2) is the worse outcome according to my panicking ego, because ohmygod ohmygod I'm on track to graduation and I have to look for my first ""real"" job while working the current one.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever's manning my ship is mostly thinking short to midterm, has FOMO riding in the background 24/7 and would hate the idea of changing course, whether it is to consider alternate life paths now or after I get my ""real"" job.

In other words, I feel like a lazy coward and a complete moron for fantasizing about publishing not being my thing when it's only gonna be the 2nd internship, AND I've been told non-internships are very different from internships. I know nothing, and yet I pretend I already know the outcome.

Is there any way of getting out of this? I have contemplated just soldiering through and seeing how it works out, but then I feel like it'll be more painful if I decide it'll be okay and yet it isn't.

I've also been endlessly postponing on taking the time to introspect and decide some sort of life strategy. To the point that if some ""where do you want to be in three years"" scenario doesn't include a white collar job and creative writing/working with writers, I'm not even willing to consider it, regardless of how I truly feel about positions of higher responsibility or creative writing/working with writers.  

Thank you for reading and thank you for your feedback. Have a good one!"

tx2one,2,2022-04-05,Finally got my foot in the door with Jr. Developer position but not fully happy at company. Struggling b/c I don’t want to LC grind for a new job and I feel emotionally bad for leaving coworkers who are invested in my growth,AruarianJazz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tx2one/finally_got_my_foot_in_the_door_with_jr_developer/,"Background: Went back to school recently to get a second Bachelor’s in CS while working full-time in technical support. Was dumb and didn’t apply to any internships during school and it’s always been a struggle to work on personal projects so it was incredibly difficult to land any jobs. I also found LC grinding incredibly tedious and stressful.

Job: With a mix of luck/opportunity, I applied for a job and was able to get my foot in the door without an intense technical interview because the catch was, I needed to start off as a technical writer first and would eventually transition into developer. Still in the process of transitioning and it’s been frustrating to not be writing code full time just yet but I’ve been trying to appreciate the fact that I’m slowly getting projects. That plus the fact that I’m getting assigned technologies that aren’t super up to date or “cool” / “fun” and there isn’t the most guidance from other developers are my biggest gripes with the job. This might be optimistic thinking but there might be cool opportunities for growth if I stick it out at this company.

Job search stress: Like I mentioned in my background, I think most people would agree that searching for jobs is the worst. For the past few months at this job, I’ve been so happy not to stress out about applying / studying for interviews and to finally have free time like a normal human being that I don’t want to give that up again. Thinking about going back to that grind stresses me out. Also, I know this is completely a “me personality ” problem but I get emotionally attached to people at my company who go out of their way to take interest in my growth but ultimately the cons outweigh the pros that I know I should be looking elsewhere to at least see what other opportunities are out there.

Question/advice: Logically I know the answer is very obvious. “If you’re not happy at your job, obviously look for a new job. And your coworkers won’t hate you if you leave, that’s just business.” But emotionally is where I get hung up, especially thinking about getting grilled at interviews and the fear of getting rejected. I know I’m in an infinitely better position than I was before I got this job because I finally have the title but there’s a lot of doubt because it’s not like I’ve done a ton of software development at this company. Hoping for some advice/thoughts for people who have gone through the same thing to inspire me or help me work through all this fear. Thanks everyone."
tx33dp,3,2022-04-05,Non-Compliant Rant,CosmicNoire,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/tx33dp/noncompliant_rant/,"TL;DR: This is my first year teaching, I was hired as a long-term sub and did not initially attend ""T-TESS Orientation"". I asked for alternatives to complete the orientation due to life and distance. Instead I am being told that I am non-compliant and cannot be appraised.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first year of teaching.

&amp;#x200B;

I am the Tennis Coach. I am the Cross Country Coach. I am the co-sponsor for two separate clubs which requires my presence before, after, and during school hours. I am an Intern with online practicum that I still need to finish. Above all else, I am a single dad to a little girl that I adore and whom adore me. But I am stretched SO thin I might as well be tracing paper at this point. I worked at a county jail before this and I am far more stressed trying to keep up or playing catch up than I ever felt at the jail. I do handle the stress better teaching though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am now being told I will be non-compliant due to being unable to attend a T-TESS Orientation. Without this orientation, I am ineligible to receive appraisal through T-TESS. I'm honestly uncertain how that will affect my current employment, but I tried to get help many times to get this done since I was notified and the online alternatives were not available to me because ""it's not covid times anymore"" and I was not transferred from another district and new hires MUST attend face-to-face. I did TRY to schedule and make it on a Saturday, but I caught COVID, so I had to stay home. The next available date I caught the Flu, so I had to stay home. Then my daughter got sick and I had to stay home. January, February, and March unavailable to me due to life. The last available time was this past Saturday, but I no longer have a vehicle on the weekends indefinitely in order to help family. Informing HR of this fell deaf ears as I was fed the same line as every other time. Now I am being informed I am non-compliant and that no other alternatives will be offered to me. In fact, it was recommended to me that I seek transportation for any future dates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck that.

&amp;#x200B;

I started as a long-term sub until I completed my ESL, which I passed and was then hired on full-time. I was ""prorated"" on my contract and 4k was removed. This irked me, but I carried on. I was then informed that ""oh, yeah you also need to attend T-TESS Orientation"" TWO MONTHS after I was hired on full-time. Irksome. They only had Saturdays available which I could not attend. I am in the process of completing my internship which requires hours of practicum online courses and I still owe 2k to Region 4. My apartment rent went from 881 to 1224 practically overnight and the reasoning is ""we're maintaining a market price"". I will have to pay an extra 300 because I need one more month after my lease ends before I move in with a friend during summer so I can afford to get an apartment before the summer ends. My point is I've already PAID a fuck ton of my own money for this job and I'm not paying them any more than I already have to and that's that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Despite somehow becoming balder due to stress (am bald already) I so badly want to make this work. I bitched about the system, but my co-workers are awesome, my admin isn't terrible, and I've been kicking butt as a teacher/coach. For the first time in my life, I feel like I am competent and confident at what I do. Yet, they won't offer online alternatives even though they were capable during lockdown, so what's the difference why aren't they capable? It's TOO easy, that's why. End of Rant."
tx407c,11,2022-04-05,Scrum/agile is radicalizing me,Cannolium,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tx407c/scrumagile_is_radicalizing_me/,"I considered myself a leftist for a long time but I gotta say, nothing has radicalized me faster than my first tech job. 

I should preface this with the fact that my background is in science, and I’ve been unemployed since graduating from grad school. I’m unfortunately taking a job offer at a large financial institution so I don’t starve and become homeless. I hate that I have to take this job but as of right now, I have no other way to live.

Anyways. Its been a several months long process to even get hired as an intern. I applied back in November of 2021, did months of workshopping and projects, and I’m doing pre intern training the whole month of April. In May I start an internship that goes on for several weeks and leads to a full time job given I don’t mess literally everything up (we’ll see how this goes). 

During this training, we learn about agile and scrum. For those out of the loop, these are just industry processes for creating products. The main figures of this process are the product owner, the stakeholders and the dev team. After reading and watching countless articles and videos about this process, I’ve come to realize plain and simple that the product owners and stake holders produce literally nothing of value. The owner ultimately decides the products general direction and that’s it. Stakeholders tell the product owner what they want and the product owner tells the devs what to work on or not work on. The devs end up creating literally everything of value and yet they are getting shafted by both product owners and stake holders. Fuck this shit man.

This is also not to mention the fact that the Devs are the skilled laborers here. We’ve put time and effort into education, skills and general wisdom about the work we do, and somehow make the least money out of the product we make. 

I’d also like to add that I know this comes from a place of privilege, I acknowledge that. Tech jobs are well paying (mostly), and I’m better off than most, but it’s crazy the profit that’s made mostly ends up in the pockets of the people who do the absolute minimum."

tx4crr,1,2022-04-05,Contract work or student job as a college student?,Distinct_Village_87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tx4crr/contract_work_or_student_job_as_a_college_student/,"I currently hold a student job (CS related) at my school that pays about $15/hour (rounded to the nearest $5/hour for anonymity). For this $15/hour, I mostly telework, but have my own office that I can use any time I want (even when I am not on the clock -- I have used it to study in right before an exam when where I would normally go is too loud, etc.). I am exempt from FICA/Social Security/Medicare taxes working for my school. I am guaranteed $1/hour raises every 6 calendar months. I am also guaranteed unpaid time off whenever I want -- i.e. they are _very_ flexible on schedule, I can choose to not work anytime I want, essentially. Those are the only benefits I receive.

A startup offered me about $50/hour (rounded to the nearest $10/hour for anonymity), as a contractor, to work for them during the school year. I am certain that I will be much busier than my student job and I would lose my office. I don't think it will not be a stable position -- they are a startup preparing to launch what I think is a good product, they already have a fair amount of beta customers, etc. -- but since I am a contractor, I can't be sure of that. I currently deliver for Uber Eats on the side so I know about self-employment tax, schedule C business expenses, etc. all too well.

But my question is this: is the (perceived) lack of stability of the contractor job worth jumping ship? If I do jump ship, it would be in September -- I have an internship for the summer, and I don't like burning bridges/reneging (that, in my opinion, is just disrespectful and insulting).

Scholarships are paying for my time in university in full. I do not _need_ the money. I do not want to chase money; there are more important things in life. But that being said, I won't turn money down. A few friends of mine work at that startup and I think I am going to be asking them about how it is there... one is a student and is a contractor, one is a W-2 full-time employee.

This startup may be a good thing to put on my resume too, so that may be something to consider? Perhaps this startup might be a pathway to a full-time W-2?

If the product flops all of a sudden, they would naturally drop me and say ""sorry, we can't give you any more hours"". Then what? I would have to go beg for my university's job back.

So... what do you think I should do? Thanks!"
tx56w4,2,2022-04-05,I'm a systems engineer with an aerospace bachelor's planning to transition to a software engineering career. I want to go back to school to facilitate that. What would you do in my shoes?,beemcalister,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tx56w4/im_a_systems_engineer_with_an_aerospace_bachelors/,"Context: My employer has agreed to pay for software engineering classes so this would all be free. 

I'm currently programming at work for the first time ever. No prior experience but since I program at my job my company is willing to pay for classes. I think I have three options.

1 - Local university offers a software engineering certificate. It would take 2 years to complete part-time because I'm missing a lot of pre-requisites.

2 - Online bachelor's degrees. There are some post-bacc programs that are geared towards this transition, and then some regular bachelor's programs. I could get a second bachelor's at UMGC, CSU Global, UF online, etc. Feel free to recommend a rigorous online program if you know of one! 

3 - Online master's degree. I think this would be tough because I have no prior programming experience so I think I'd have to take pre-reqs for at least a year before starting. So the most time consuming, but I recognize this would look the best on my resume.

My ultimate goal is to remain in the aerospace industry, but move out of defense into commercial space. I want to work on spacecraft as a software engineer. Since my first engineering internship, I've accidentally entrenched myself in an area of aerospace engineering that I really don't enjoy and I've found that I love programming, so if I'm dead set on this transition,

Still have roughly 5 weeks before the start date of company A.

Full:

The thing is w/ renenging my current offer, i’d just like a d*ck. We (recruiter n I) came to a salary agreement after a couple of back and forth negotiation. 

I know theyve really put “effort” into this bc the salary that we finally agreed on is definitely higher than almost all werkstudent/intern salaries Im seeing (germany). It’s defo highest in the company compared to the similar positions’ thats published online.

But then, next thing I knew, like a week later after signing that offer, an unexpected offer came from company B and they offered me an even higher salary… with all the pluses I mentioned above (plus moore perks). Without a shadow of a doubt im signing companys B offer now.

Now, a question to you all. How to break it to company’s A recruiter? Should I be honest? Or should I just say it’s a personal matter?

In both cases I know my stance (being very sorry / apologetic) and I genuinely feel really guilty/bad about it. But I feel like company B will take care of me better as well as it’s able to provide me with more learning opportunities.

I may be strong for my size, but I'll never be as strong as someone who is 6 foot tall and naturally muscled.

I started three years ago at $10/hour, no health benefits. I'm now at $15/hour, still no health benefits (doing the math on inflation alone, I am barely making more than I did in my college internship, but at least then, I was still covered by my parents' health plan; I'  now paying $300/month for my own health plan)... But all but my first raise seemed to coincide with them withering hiring a new person when someone left or them putting out an ad for a new employee. We recently lost one employee who moved away due to their spouse's work and have been unable to fill the position. I am in a ""near managerial"" role now, so I saw the job posting. The are now starting new employees at $12.50 an hour. Or so I thought: The man who was hired after I was hired was under the impression they started everyone at $14 an hour, since he started at that. When he started, I got a raise from $11 an hour to $12.50 an hour. Only a month ago, I got a raise from $14 an hour to $15 an hour, coinciding with when they made the new job posting.

I should add: I live in a city. It is expensive here. The median house costs $600,000, along with insane property taxes. Rent is now averaging $1,500 a month in this city. I rent, and I'm only hanging on here because I'm married and my spouse makes more than I do.

A year ago, my spouse and I started thinking of leaving the state, because we can actually afford to buy a house in another state that doesn't have insane property taxes, as long as it's not in a big city. Three months ago, we committed to leaving. Now, we're close to actually buying a house elsewhere. I need to start seriously looking for employment where we're moving, plus... Today was the worst day I've ever had at work, physically. I worked for over 10 hours straight in the heat. On my feet. Lifting stuff. On very little sleep, because I've been sick and that makes it hard to sleep (plus one of my on-the-job injuries interrupts my sleep every night).

Before today, I had already planned to put in my two weeks on Thursday, but after today I feel like doing so will be fucking my coworkers, whom I all really like. And I'll be fucking over the boss and owner, who are cool, but... Can they really not afford to pay us more and give us health insurance? Can they not afford to hire two more people, especially after business has boomed?

Please tell me I'm not a horrible person for quitting this job when we're already one man down. Talk me in to going through with what I already had planned, please!"

As the title suggests I'm currently working at a small local company in Singapore as a Senior Front End Developer, and I've been here for a little over a year now. Started off as an intern in August 2020 then progressed to Junior Dev starting Jan 2021, and finally got promoted to Senior Dev in Jan 2022. 

At this point I believe I have gained enough experience and skills to explore a career in a bigger MNC to get more career growth. That said, I've been sending out many applications and but haven't been getting back any replies from any companies. It's either that or I get rejections even without an interview.

I'm just looking for suggestions on how I can better go about my job search to transition into a bigger company - I'm specifically looking for an MNC.

I'd appreciate your help!!!"

For college, I chose engineering because i'm okay at  math and science. I excelled in school and I am in a master's program. However, every practical engineering setting like an internship or engineering skills like Solidworks, machine shop, hand work etc, I fail. 

For example, I spent 3 weeks designing and failing and trying to code something for an internship and this other intern, who is 4 years younger than me, finished it in 10 minutes. I sucked at the design portion, the solidworks, the critical thinking, the whole 9 yards. I have nothing to show for my work. At every internship i've had i've failed and have had very little to show for it at the end of it. The things I thought I was good at, like MATLAB, I suck at in the industry. At school I can do all sorts of projects but when i'm interning and the job asks for something similar, I can't produce results. I have no idea why. I try and code but it doesn't work. 

I'm not sure i'm cut out to be an engineer in the field. School is very different than industry and so far I suck when i've been interning in industry. I feel like I learn nothing while working and I don't feel like i'm even helping. If this is the case, should I change career paths? If so what career could I pivot to?"

txdku4,1,2022-04-06,Need Advice,anonnus3r_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/txdku4/need_advice/,"I am a junior-transfer at a top school. All year, I've been busy with classes, ECs, recruitment, interview prep, a part time job (first semester), an in-semester internship (current semester), and so on. In light of this, I have basically poured most of my efforts into my work life and neglected my social life. Most of me doesn't care that this is the case. However, there is a small part of me that wants to save my dying social life.

I must say that I have had incredibly negative experiences with people in the past, so much so that I have developed trust issues in recent years. To be quite frank, I have never gotten along with a majority of my peers since as long as I can remember. Instance after instance, people have always found ways to intentionally or unintentionally screw me over. As such, I have sort-of withdrawn myself socially, ever since the start of COVID. Over time, I have learned to not have expectations of others. I do not dwell on the past, but I must say that I've learned a lot from it.

Interestingly, some people do not believe me when I say that I am an introvert. In all truthfulness, I would describe myself as a confident introvert; i.e., I am not shy. On top of this, I am good looking, in shape, hygienic, very organized, and always very nicely dressed.

Despite these qualities, however, I have found it increasingly difficult to socialize with new people. Of course, I have a handful of nice and welcoming friends that I eat with on occasion, but I find that I do not connect with them, mainly because they: are a bit too nerdy, lack confidence, have no desire to go out, and have no experience with girls. Don't get me wrong, I like them but I must mention this to provide context as to how they aren't helping me progress my social abilities. I find that the more social guys tend to be superficial and are not people I'd want to make plans with.

I suppose that my desire to socialize truly dwindled after my situation-ship with this one girl last semester; to clarify, she was not the sole cause, but more so the last straw. She is highly accomplished and comes from a wealthy family. She was super clingy at first which prompted me to follow suit. We were both very busy and got lonely so we were there for each other when possible. However, she seemed to have gotten bored of me towards the end of the semester. Looking back, I should have seen the red flags: she explicitly said how she gets bored of everything and everyone, how she has been accused of using others for comfort, etc. Long story short, she ended up ghosting me and started posting her new bf all over IG. Her new bf also has the same first-name as me (wtf). On top of this, her new bf is ugly and scrawny; however, he is wealthy like her and they're both from the same country. I guess I was taken a little off guard by this since we promised each other that we'd be exclusive and that we'd communicate if either one of us wanted to end things. After that, my will to meet new girls dropped like the Rouble. I have female friends but I have not been pursuing girls since this incident. It's been a few months now, and I have lost all feelings for her. I want to start seeing new girls but I do not have the motivation, nor time to pursue that endeavor.

In summation, I am overwhelmed by work and have had adverse experiences that have diminished my will to socialize. Any thoughts/advice on how I can improve my situation?"

Hi everyone, I’m very fortunate to land offers for MSFT and Splunk for PM. I received MSFT offer before Splunk and had already accepted it. I’m a Canadian student I really want to do an internship in person in the States, but I need a J1 visa. I submitted my visa application with Microsoft on March 18, however recently they have been rescinding in-person internship offers and offering virtual to some people. Splunk has guaranteed that they could get me a J1 visa for this summer, so I'm not sure if I should risk waiting for my visa application with Microsoft or to just renege and take the Splunk offer. This is my last internship and I’m hoping to get a full time offer from either place I choose for this summer. Any advice is appreciate!"

I used to be that kid that sat in the corner talking to no one, wandering around the school courtyard by myself, etc. A lot of my teachers said that I was too shy, too quiet etc. I’ve always felt like I’m a little bit abnormal in so many ways like as if I’m an outsider from Mars impersonating an Earthling. 

And then, I moved to America. Things got 10x times worse. Being shy plus having the language barrier is the worst combo ever. For years, I did not speak English at all. I talked to no one. I just went to school then went straight home. Rinse and repeat. For almost 7 years straight. I went though high school without making a single friend. 

But in recent years, things have changed a little for the better. When I started college, I tried to put myself out there more. I found myself talking more in class. Things were starting to look ok. Then 2 years ago, I found my best friend online and we still have several phones every week. So I would say that I’m definitely improving. 

Anyway, with all that being said, there are still times where I am hit with these huge waves of anxiety whenever I have to open my mouth, especially in situations or places where I messed up really badly before. Right now, I’m working at a pharmacy as an intern, and I keep stuttering and mumbling. I analyze my English too much, and I keep being afraid of taking up people’s time or offending people for having an accent. Just the setting makes me feel so tensed up because several years ago I also worked at another pharmacy, and the manager there mocked my English in front of everyone. 

I am proud and happy with myself for at least trying to improve because just me talking on the phone with my best friend would be out of the question years ago for me, but I’m also upset at myself for still getting hit with these walls out of nowhere. Can anyone else relate to this?"

I had applied for Pennsylvania State University, University Park for MS in CS for Fall 2022 but unfortunately received a rejection a few days back with a proposal to apply for their Harrisburg campus with fee waiver. Hence I am considering applying there and would like to know a few things about the graduate CS program there. 

My interests are in AI/ML research specifically towards Computer Vision and NLP. After my graduation I would like to work in ML related roles in the Big 4. I had the following questions regarding the MS in CS program:


1. How is the MS in CS program at HBG? I have heard that the class size is small hence more personal attention is offered but are the courses good? 


2. How is the AI/ML (specifically Computer Vision and NLP) research at HBG campus? How are the professors teaching courses related to AI? Are they approachable?


3. How is it in terms of job prospects and internships? Does the location help with the Internships and Jobs? Does it have the same reputation as the University Park campus? Asking this because:

     1. Their admissions requirements are much less than UP
     2. I feel their research section is not mentioned very well.
     3. Ultimately I would like to get a good job after my Master's hence it is important for to consider these factors.



4. How is the student life in and around the campus?


I hope some current graduate students and alumni of Pennsylvania State University, Harrisburg would share their views."

In 8th grade and my freshman year, I was on a strong path. I had finished Andrew Ng’s Coursera course on Machine Learning, self taught Calculus BC while in pre-algebra, got a 33 on a practice ACT, etc. But then I realized nobody cared, so I wasted pretty much my entire sophomore and junior years playing video games and watching TV. I never once thought about college until my senior year; I had never heard of an olympiad or ISEF, didn’t even know people did internships, research, or summer programs, no clue that high schoolers were legally allowed to form companies and nonprofits. I was lucky enough to probably have access to some of these opportunities, but I never knew they existed. 

I maintained a 4.0 GPA without really ever studying, and I haven’t done homework at home in over 2 years. I got my 36 without studying at all in the months leading up to it, maybe studied for the ACT for 2 weeks in total (one in my freshman year, other as a rising junior). I just did what I enjoyed, and now I regret that, as some may have seen in my [recent A2C post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/twux19/hot_take_do_what_you_enjoy_is_terrible_advice_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Almost everyone, friends and family alike, though I would get into at least one of HYPSM; I was one of two people in our county to get a 36 (plus I did academics outside of school).

At my high school, I am probably the only Asian male in CS, so I never even realized I was falling right into the stereotype. Coming to the A2C community was a massive shock, as I slowly realized my expectations were incredibly unrealistic, and that I didn’t really stand out in any way. (I’m at least 11 of [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qm4smn/bingo_card_for_my_fellow_cs_majors_can_you_get_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)...)

So, as happy as I am about Georgia Tech, I can’t help but think about how much more I could’ve achieved. Anybody who says to do what you enjoy probably lives in a competitive environment because the people who do that at my high school just slack off for four years or maybe join a single school club. I wish I could go back and tell myself about all the extracurriculars that people here do; if not for application purposes, then at least for personal development."

I just applied to the BS/MS in CS program at my school, should hear back in a few weeks. Currently a 3rd year. When I graduate undergrad I'll have several internships under my belt and be in a good position for full-time recruiting. However, I also think that if I don't do a master's now, I'm never going to do one. I don't know if I have it in me to do an online master's while working. 

The MS CS program has a concentration that really interests me. I'm thinking of asking my summer internship for a return internship offer instead of full-time. Has anyone here done a BS/MS? Was it worth delaying going into industry for a year? Do you think it was useful long term? (Also if I TA as a masters student I get my tuition waived)"

U are under obligation to always say no to community organizations who are actually doing good work. Part of why I hate doing government jobs is because I’m on my phone all day when there is no work because I’m bored, or I’m doing very boring work in general if I have work to do. I run my own program as well so I find myself to be very lonely and really want to be in a more collaborative job.

My question is, in a more corporate young professionals job, how does the day to day look like? Are you constantly working alone on projects? Do you have more bonding sessions with your coworkers? Is it just dry small talk? How often do you have meetings and how do they look like? I’m just wondering how the private sector, including non profit, looks day to day because I’ve never worked in it."

I am from a tier-2 college with an 8.7 gpa. Since my second year of undergrad I wanted to do an MS, any other post grad like an MBA or MTech in India would have been far more difficult (oh how wrong was I). Slogged my way to get a higher gpa, reached 8.6 at the end of second year. Did an research internship, could not get any publish worthy results. In my 3rd year continued my research with a lab in my college, still no results, but bumped my GPA upto 8.8. Corona came, joined one of the best research labs in my country. The damned virus fucked the grading system in college, numbnuts who were not even able to score 10-15% were now getting 70-80%. Naturally, was screwed by the relative grading system. But things at my group were going well. And by ""going well"" in academia I mean working day and night, no weekend nothing. Was doing a lot of collaboration with well reputed international labs. By that I mean, there were 10s of different co-authors I had never met. Anyways, was able to publish 7 research papers in international journals and conferences all as the first author. Got recommendation from one of the biggest computer science profs in india, one from Oxford, one chief research scientist and one prof from eu. 330 gre, 108 TOEFL. I thought I was all set. I prepared 3 complete years to reach this position. Every decision I ever made was for this month. I really thought I had done enough. 8.7 gpa, 7 good research papers in computer vision, strong recommendations from some well known researchers, 2 years of research experience. I though I was set to leave this year. Working through the nights, smoking like a chimney, exploited by my supervisors, I thought everything will be worth it. 
Well here we are, 15 rejects from various MSCS programs. No accepts, only UCLA left to make it's decision. What can I even do next year to ensure this doesn't happen again?"

The incremental responsibility is only 2-4 hours per week so not quite enough for me to expand my business but enough for me to take QOL hit because I constantly have the weight of unfinished tasks in the back of my mind.

The client has proposed to hire another contractor but I don't like it because I lose control over the project and I can make more by outsourcing the work.

However, I don't have experience with outsourcing and worry about having to manage someone else's work. I'm using client provided laptop so I can't use sites such as fiverr. It feels like the simplest way is for the person to come to my house and work using client provided laptop but I'm not sure if anyone (competent) is willing to do that for such small amount of time. It's also just not an ideal set up.

The work is more data analytics than DS, ie. SQL and Python pipeline. I'm thinking I could maybe get by with hiring a student intern or someone trying to break into the field, but that means I need to put in a lot of training time, which I don't really have time for and I need to pay the person for those training hours but can't bill my client for it. However, if this is just the initial investment cost to have a reliable staff, I'm ok with putting in the time and money.

So far I have been putting in the hours at the sacrifice of my person time but I can't keep doing that forever."

txt6um,86,2022-04-06,My Tepper Experience,Maleficent-Speed-357,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/txt6um/my_tepper_experience/,"Since it is admitted student decision time, I want to share my experience as a first-year at Tepper. I'm doing this in hopes it will make incoming students' choices easier. I'll tell you a little about me, and then go into what I do and don't like about Tepper. Cliffs for anyone who isn't going to read, I love it.

About me: 

I have a non-traditional background and came into the program with no clue what I wanted to do full-time or for an internship. I ended up with a big tech internship as a product manager (that's my job title) plus a bunch of offers in and out of tech. I never would have guessed that possible based on my background, but Tepper made it happen.

The Good:

Loads of support recruiting. All schools have active professional clubs, so I won't go there. Career coaching is where Tepper shines. I was able to meet with counselors whenever I wanted, and one of them worked so closely with me that I credit her with my internship. Seriously transformative. When applying, I heard from people in other schools that career services isn't there to help you interview or get a job. Not here.

Classes are useful. We have the classic core courses on business topics, just like everywhere, but we also have required courses in optimization and statistical decision making/data science. We learn these quant topics and their applications in a way that makes me feel like I'll have an upper hand this summer. I guarantee you I'll be pulling out my linear programming and all kinds of regression skills. They make me feel like I have value to add beyond being able to talk to people effectively and read a 10k.

The people are great. I assume this is the case in every school, but with Tepper being the smallest school in the T20, I'm guessing I know them better than I would have at one of the bigger schools I got into. You can party Thursday through Sunday if you want, or you can find a quieter group. My friends and I have even found ways to do both.

The bad:

Food options on campus are sketchy. I went to an undergrad where we had Subway, McDonald's, etc. If CMU thinks I'm eating at their off-brand salad shop, they're mistaken. Surely it is fine, but it isn't my thing.

The layout of Tepper sucks. It is beautiful but at the expense of bathroom space and water fountains. Seriously annoying.

And obviously, we have a low percentage of women. You all know that already. No comment from me other than that I would like the percentage to go up.

I had already gotten a basic A+ cert in high school and got some basic certs out of tech school by the time I graduated, but then due to life issues and also just getting rejected from everything I wasn't able to land an entry level IT job at all. The problem largely falls on me due to not doing any sort of internship or the like while at tech school but I figured I could land something basic still.   


Come last year I finally landed an entry level job as a tier 1 tech. I consistently got told I was doing great but over the past 10 months or so the job itself has been wearing down on me mentally hard. Part due to losing general interest in IT due to taking so long to land a job and part due to this job itself. Generally people from calls are nice but there's such a massive workload and I have generally picking up a larger portion of the calls due to people either not doing there job or generally just taking forever to do 1 call. I've reached a point to make this due to some things that happened the past few days.   


Yesterday I received a call about someone having malware and as I am supposed to reach out about that as they do not want me as a tier 1 to handle any potential malware and I had just gotten talked down to about it the entire time like I had never used a PC before, and today I had gotten yelled at by both a customer and a coworker over an issue I could do nothing about as it is managed by a different department. These moments while everything else has been happening on top of basically being on my own for most issues and then getting talked down to after escalating for those issues I'm just exhausted and mentally worn. It's hard to take the time I have off of work to research and study for higher positions like sysadmins when my job has made me basically loathe the work and I'm not sure what to do  


TL;DR im tired of my first position in IT and don't know what to do with myself"

It's not surprising but deep down my optimism was crushed after seeing the decision letter. Fall-22 has been brutal, and with just 2 decisions remaining (Columbia and USC MS CS), my anxiety increases exponentially each day. Even though I have 5 admits so far (from UC Davis, Johns Hopkins, NCSU, NEU Boston, ISU CS programs), I'm broken from the 4 rejections, 2 of which were most surprising (UVA and UMN CS programs) and the other 2 were my dream (UCSD and GT MS CS). The current admits that I have are not among my top-4 picks and therefore I'm worried regarding further prospects. Added to my misery is the fact that I didn't pay the security deposit for NEU Boston (I received admit in early Feb and back then I was confident of at least getting 1 of my top-4 picks). Now, I have been hearing that the job prospects for UC Davis MS CS (my current top admit) aren't as great as NEU. Further, if USC offers me spring admission instead of fall then I will be ruined (and I have no certainty regarding when they will send their decision). 

I can't help but think if things would have worked out differently if I joined a different university for my undergrad, where it was easier to obtain higher CGPAs. Regret is all that I have left now. On one hand, I'm happy that I got at least got something in this brutal season, and on another, I'm feeling unsatisfied for not doing better. I'm constantly questioning my choices (and I know I have no control over them) and hoping everything works out in the end. 

Here's my profile in case anyone is curious: CGPA: 9.19 from Tier-2 (Awarded Academic Excellence Award by the Institute for rank in the department), GRE: 320 (Q-165, V-155, AWA-4.5), TOEFL: 113, 4 Internships (2 startups, 1 big firm, 1 research one from the institute) + Mitacs Globalink Research Internship from Canada, 3 Scopus-indexed publications (nothing fancy but not predatory either), volunteer experience from multiple NGOs, past TA experience, headed a big tech-related club at the university and had live personal projects used throughout the university.

Overall, I have been working on my profile for as long as I can remember (even before joining my undergrad). At this point, I believe it was not in my fate. This post is just my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone. Wishing the best to everyone who is waiting for their dream decisions!"

ap lang teacher (6/10)- i was one of four people in person for her class last year, so i got to know her pretty well and i made significant progress over the year with her. she's a pretty popular recommender and typically spends some time on them

math teacher (7/10)- i had her for virtual precalc junior year and calc ab this year in-person. she's literally the sweetest teacher ever and sparked my interest in math, and she really likes me (i hope). i also submitted her letter for a journalism award and she sent it to my adviser, and while i didn't see it, all my adviser had to say was ""bless her heart, she uses two spaces after every period""

yearbook adviser (11/10)- i had her all four years of high school and i would sometimes see her for 6 hours every day. she said she wrote quite a bit about me and even had to cut it down a little, and i submitted her to every school that accepted an additional recommender from a non-core class

counselor (2/10)- i've spoken to him maybe 4 times throughout all of high school

**Interviews**

georgetown (7/10) - our technology malfunctioned at first, but once we got past that, he was really nice (the nicest one i had). he seemed really impressed with a lot of things i did and gave me advice on politics and what i want to do in the future. i did also say that my favorite book from ap lang was the crucible and i totally blanked when he asked me what the plot was

mit (3/10)- most boring man i have EVER met. didn't connect on anything

upenn (6/10) - nice and the youngest interviewer i had, but he was a lawyer and you could tell. it was very stressful but we did connect over journalism things. although, he asked what i would do with a million dollars, and i said go to new hampshire (????????)

yale (11/10) - BEST INTERVIEW EVER. made me want to go to yale so bad. i didn't talk about my past or explain my extracurriculars at all, but it was more like talking w a professor. we talked about political theory, economic theory, journalism in the new age, SCOTUS cases, etc. i did break the rule about talking about politics, but it was more about what that person represented for journalism. i logged off thinking that if everyone at yale was like this, it was definitely 100% first choice

harvard (-1/10) - he asked for my resume and just went line by line. it wasn't necessarily bad, but the way he talked about some things made me know harvard wasn't for me. he asked where my parents went to know what harvard's competition was, and i had to explain how my dad never finished college. he then went into a long speech about how his family had six generations go to harvard. the tone he had was humiliating honestly

**Essays**

worked on them for a long time but i 100% sound unhinged in every. damn. essay. (i took be yourself very seriously). i said real hot girl shit to yale, talked about how i'm like a sorority president, started my common app off with funerals, mention jojo siwa to columbia. you get the point

**Additional Information:**

i honestly can't believe that i am going to an ivy league. my dream school my whole life was ut, and everything from there was just for shits and gigs. i didn't even start to look at t10s until the summer before senior year, because before then, i was just looking at usc and nyu because they had journalism programs. yale wasn't even on my radar, but it is the perfect school for me now.

this has honestly been the wildest and most stressful process of my life, and while i'm happy where i finished, i am so glad to never have to do this again in my life. looking back, i wouldn't change a single thing because everything i did in high school was because i did everything for myself, not colleges, and i still had fun every day. things just ended up in the right place by senior year and i got a little bit of luck.

thanks for reading and good luck to future classes!!"

After mulling it over, I decided to go back to school for a degree that would make me more hirable, namely an engineering degree.  I completed my deficiency courses, and I have been taking graduate coursework for about a year now.  I am on a Thesis track.

Now for the Actual Question: How much will not having an internship hurt my job prospects?  I messed up my resume, and so I did not get a summer internship this semester, and I am looking to graduate in a year, so internships for next summer are off the table.  Fall and Spring internships are also not an option for me as my TA position takes place during the Fall and Spring.  I am going to have a masters.  I am working on a research project.  I will write and defend my master's thesis.  I have also had non-engineering related summer jobs.  In light of all this experience I do have, will the lack of an internship on my resume hurt my chances of getting a solid job after graduation?"

For programmers, after they re-learn or learn new languages, they can create an online porfolio to show their programming skills.

For would be network engineers (or admin/associate), what needs to be done instead?

While I may have some ideas like re-learning stuff and using the latest packet tracer (if available), then go for certifications, what actually needs to be done aside from what I mentioned?

\----------------------------------------------------------

Order of IT skillsets (From \[#1\]  what I used to be very good at most easiest for me learn to the \[#10\] least I'm knowledgeable of and having more difficulty in learning):

1. Networks
2. Database (SQL)
3. Linux terminal commands / Windows Server CMD
4. Programming (Back End)
5. Programming (Front End)

I will have them working with me on SolidWorks designs, and implementing improvements to equipment on the shop floor.

The best interns we get are always the ones who have a great work ethic, they take initiative and when given a task, they start working on it immediately.
Every intern so far, seems to be great at being creative and good at critical thinking.

Unfortunately, we sometimes get an intern with the attitude that they think they are always right, and anyone elses idea won't work. Or we just get someone who has a problem of being on their phone all day.

What kind of questions do you think i could ask these engineering students, that would help me weed out the bad ones?"

I recently changed my major to cs, and I am currently a freshman in my second semester.

But since I'm starting so late, do you think I have a chance to get a FAANG internship in my junior or senior year?

Thus, I'm considering taking it over the summer at a CC (online, had this professor last summer and she's very good). However, I also have a PM internship this summer and I'm unsure if I can manage the workload. 

The reason why I wasn't able to do well this semester in this class is simply because I was too busy with other things, and I don't want to spend more money and still fail the class over the summer and also hinder my internship experience. At the same time, if I take this in fall, I will definitely have to drop my minor + possibly graduate a semester late. 

What should I do?"

ty3nrv,5,2022-04-06,should i bother graduating with an associates in hs?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ty3nrv/should_i_bother_graduating_with_an_associates_in/,"**TLDR; so is it worth it to finish up the associate's? or should i forget about completing the exact degree and gen-eds, to instead take random courses i'm interested in?**

i'm a current junior in california, so all community college courses that i take can be pretty much transferred to CSUs and UCs. i have 30 out 60 of the required units needed for an AA-T in a specific major. if i want the degree, i only have 2 more major-specific courses left to lake and a handful of IGETC requirements (some i could probably complete after AP exams), and i would end up going to undergrad for that major. if i don't take classes for the degree i would just take a smattering of courses to explore other subjects, and not necessarily fulfill IGETC gen-eds.

i've seen posts similar to mine about if it getting an associate's gives you a boost in admissions, and the answer i saw for those was that it's seen as no different than a rigorous AP/IB courseload, and the main benefit comes from being able to save on tuition. but i think my situation is different because the CC courses i take don't go towards my HS graduation requirements, so i've always taken a full schedule at school (all periods) with satisfactory rigor (11th - 3 APs, planned 12th - 5 APs), along with CC. 

very sorry for the long list and rambling, but here are my thoughts below 🙏

&amp;#x200B;

|PROS|CONS|
|:-|:-|
|1. it would save me money and time for a bachelor's later on. especially because i'd likely attend grad school or law school|1. i wouldn't be able to take fun courses (ex. history of feminist film) since i'd be taking all the requirements|
|2. i'm still completing a ton of gen-eds so transferring my credits later would be helpful for any major|2. it's be a waste to earn an associate's for a major i might not end up getting a bachelor's for|
|3. courses i take towards an associate's would also contribute towards my UC GPA (4.0 at CC + all college classes count as weighted, while my HS GPA is 3.8UW, 4.2W)|3. most other courses would also contribute towards my UC GPA|
|4. i would most likely attend a UC as an international in-state student anyway|4. AA-T is specific to california public universities and all those credits could go to waste if i attend a private or OOS school that doesn't accept them|
|5. my ECs are lacking so maybe the commitment towards degree could explain the gap between academics and ECs|5. opportunity cost. i could spend that same time getting more involved in clubs and internships|
|6. HS has a no APs policy for 9/10th so an associate's would be quantifiable proof that i can handle higher than average courseload. and i only have to take an average of 3 CC classes for summer 2022, fall 2022, spring 2023, which is definitely doable. in fact if i went this route i would likely stack up over the summer with 5, hope that AP scores get rid of at least 2 more, and left with just 1 or 2 in the fall.|6. time commitment. although taking these CC classes has never interfered with my regular schedule, since i always choose online without live lectures, fall of senior year will probably busier than usual|
|7. good for a back-up plan if i get unsatisfactory admission decisions because it'll make it easy to transfer to certain UCs|7. although it seems like the pros are stronger than the cons, many of those points can be applied to CC classes in general, not just the associate's, so i'm not sure what the specific benefits are|

thank you so much for reading through and i would love to hear any advice at all."
ty42qe,6,2022-04-06,How do I make up lost time and opportunity?,CoachGlad8103,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ty42qe/how_do_i_make_up_lost_time_and_opportunity/,"I am currently a high school Junior, and recently I have been starting to really look into the college app process and worry a bit. My freshman and sophomore year I, unfortunately, lacked foresight and drive and did not think too much about college and what I should’ve been doing to set myself up for success. I did have a job after sophomore year over the summer, and I did do a semester abroad sophomore year which may be beneficial. My grades were okay, almost all As but my 9th grade semester 1 was not ideal and is dragging my GPA down (so despite a likely 4.0/4.2 GPA junior year I’ll likely finish w 3.8-3.9 range). 
This year (junior year), I’ve really started to pick up steam, but I’m not sure it’s enough. My dream would be to go to T20 institutions. However, I feel that I have some obvious inadequacies: I don’t really have a “spike”, I don’t have great ECs (as of now it’s my old job, team captain of 3 teams,  and weekly computational math club), though I do have some options in the works (hoping to be class president, internship over the summer, potential board position on my towns national forest service, volunteering at local elem school, hoping to start some sort of club next year). I’m studying for the ACT and think I can get a 35 (based on a 34 practice test). What’s most concerning is my lack of a spike. I’m not particularly great at any one subject, and my ECs don’t reflect that either. I’m a well rounded student (I’ve always taken the most difficult course load my school offers, AP and honors  math, honors sciences, good at humanities too), but i tend to enjoy humanities more than STEM (specifically philosophy, which  this year Ive read a lot of when I can). My school is fairly rigorous too, so I’m not left with lots of free time, but up until this year I hadn’t used that free time productively. How do I go about making up for my pitfalls with my time remaining? Is it worth trying to get really good at something now, or is it too late? Is it really reasonable for me to hope for T20 or is that a pipe dream?"

I'm also a junior ~3 yoe.

In the team we have 6 devs 2 of which are just not making the cut.

One has spent an entire sprint writing 4 tests. 


The other is a copy and paste dev. We work  converting legacy apps to newer frameworks. This lad basically extracts the legacy code and dumps it in to the new backend. If there's any change to business requirements he can't refactor the code to meet the new acceptance criteria. Add that to the amount of bugs and code smells he has introduced into the codebase by using garbage code from SO. The other day he asked me to help him write tests for the code he had just written. 



I couldn't believe this. This individual is working as a full stack dev for 2 years. He needs more support than the interns as a whole. I actually see him stagnating very quickly. 


I do realise it's on me too because at the start we hadn't good review standards. 


The thing is they  are a  liability and they pull out good devs down and stress them. We are finishing this project and moving on and they are pressuring managers to keep the team together. I don't want this really I'd like to keep the guys that work well together but I don't know how to say this to management in a way that doesn't make them look bad or me look bad. 

It's a real dilemma as I am not a malevolent person but I feel these people need to put out of their comfort zone. 

Managers don't really get involved in the day to day stuff because Im pretty good at driving projects. When the manager questions inconsistencies I can give good explanations but there has to be a cutoff point where you have to call out someone. It's been a 18 months and I think I need to do this. 

Any thoughts would be gratefully appreciated from experienced leads, seniors and managers."
tyc543,505,2022-04-07,Only Blood Can Put it Back,Grand_Theft_Motto,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tyc543/only_blood_can_put_it_back/,"Strange packages showed up pretty often at the House. One year, on Valentine's Day, I opened the mailbox to find a beating heart inside. Last October, a jack-o-lantern just showed up on the steps one night; the carved face changed every time I saw it. So when I nearly tripped over the small, wooden box on the porch on my way to check the mail, I wasn’t alarmed.

It looked like a classic cigar box, made from polished cedar that gleamed red-orange in the morning light. The container was roughly the size of both my hands outstretched. There was a black envelope stuck to the top of the box with a red wax seal.

“Ominous,” I muttered, bending down to pick up the envelope.

The wax broke at the first application of pressure. I briefly considered not opening the envelope and throwing the box in the trash can but the feeling was born and died in the same instant. I knew from previous experience that if I avoided any packages sent to the House, they’d start popping up in less convenient places until I acknowledged them. Since I didn’t want to see any boxes bobbing in the toilet, I opened the envelope and got ready to deal with whatever weird shit was headed my way.

Inside of the envelope was a small, milk-white card that felt expensive. Written on the card were four lines in a precise, rather pretty script:

*Keep in direct sunlight; at least one hour per day.*

*Do not open at night.*

*Do not place anything in the box you’re not willing to lose.*

*If it gets out, only blood can put it back.*

I read then reread the card, turning it over to find the back blank. There were only the four rules then; I made a wild guess that the rules were for the box. It sat there on the House’s wide porch looking innocent enough.

“Wait, direct sunlight everyday?” I asked out loud. “What if it rains? That’s not fair. Or…does that still count when the sunlight is cloudy? You know what, fuck it, I’ve got a sunlamp or three in the reptile room. How do you like them apples, box?”

The box didn’t respond.

I sighed and picked it up, wincing a little at the weight. It was far heavier than it looked; there was a density to it like it was filled with liquid lead. I put the box down on the porch swing and rolled up the sleeves of my bathrobe. There was no rule against opening the box during the day so I carefully began to search for the seams and the lid with all of the delicacy of a bomb disposal technician on the first day of his internship.

The box clicked open. I scrambled back, got my legs tangled in the robe, and gracefully fell down the porch steps into the front yard. I heard laughter; for a horrible moment, I was afraid it was coming from the box. But the source of the sound was behind me. I turned and saw that little shit Lucy Simmons on her bike in the middle of the street. When she noticed me looking, she made a funny face and stuck her tongue out.

“Did you think that was funny, there? When I slipped?” I asked, standing up.

Lucy nodded.

“You’ve made an enemy for life, child,” I replied.

The little girl shrugged and pedaled away. I mentally added her name to my extensive book of grudges. The box still stood open on the porch. I cautiously moved towards it, staying loose and limber in case I had to dive through the front door. But the box was empty. I closed the lid and scratched at my eyepatch. Bringing the object inside of the House could be like taking a lit match into a waterpark where all of the water was actually gasoline, but leaving it out on the porch would probably be worse.

It seemed wise to keep the box within sight for the rest of the day. I placed it on the table while I ate breakfast and left it on the sink while I showered. There were a few rooms I needed to check out that day to make sure nothing serious was building up. I also wanted to work on renovations in the menagerie and some light landscaping.

“Should I put you in a stroller or something?” I asked the box as I climbed into some reinforced coveralls. “Or…if I leave you on the window ledge in the kitchen, will you behave?”

The box didn’t respond.

I sighed and placed it under the window in a dry pool of daisy-colored sunshine.

“Behave,” I said, buckling on my toolbelt.

I checked on the box an hour later after I was done dehazing the Sun Room. I’d gotten a little too close to one of the salamanders and the bite mark on my hand had a bright pink halo of sunburn all around it. I figured I’d wash up in the kitchen then make lunch before heading to the Hall of Six Winds. The box was still closed and sitting on the window sill…but not where I left it. The object had shifted several inches towards the shadowy corner of the window.

“Hmm,” I said, returning the box to direct sunlight. “Duct tape it is.”

The rest of the day droned by and, as far as my caretaking duties went, it was maybe a two or three out of ten in terms of danger. Pretty relaxing, really. I settled down for the night in one of the House’s libraries. I’d brought the box with me, leaving it on a reading table while I sat in an oversized chair and drank bourbon out of a brandy glass. One of the perks of being caretaker for the House was that it did all of the grocery shopping on its own somehow or just manifested the food and drinks and occasionally fun stuff like cigars and discontinued junk food from the 90s.

I was reading something by Joyce that I think might actually have never been published anywhere other than the House when I heard the thump. I’d kind of forgotten about the box for the past hour or two. In my defense, I deal with life-shattering strangeness in the House’s hundred or thousand or however many rooms daily, so an ominous box with only four rules didn’t stand out at first. I put the book down and glanced at the floor.

The box must have slid off the table. It lay at an angle on the rich, red carpet. The box was open.

“Shit,” I said, standing up.

There was a sharp stab just below my ankle. I jerked away and tripped for the second time that day. Something tiny stood in the shadow of my armchair. At first, it looked like a deeper blackness without form or shape but it slowly resolved into a humanoid silhouette roughly six inches tall. As I watched, the shadow of the chair slowly *drained*, flowing into the creature like rain in a gutter. The impish thing grew larger as it ate the shadow, taking on the texture and color of shade. It didn’t have eyes, but I was sure it was watching me.

“I think you should, uh, get back in the box?” I suggested.

The shadow-eater, now a little more than a foot tall, began approaching me. Even though it was no bigger than a doll, I felt a quick jab of panic as it came closer. There was a presence to the creature that was much larger than its physical form, a bleeding cold coming off of it in waves. It passed through another shadow cast by the fireplace and began to drink that up, growing slowly but observably.

I exited the library at a sprint, careening into the wall then down the hallway. There were at least three armories inside of the House (that I knew of) as well as one room full of just a shit ton of axes. Any of those rooms would have been acceptable under the circumstances. I skidded to a halt next to a blank wooden door set in the hall. There was no sign of the little imp behind me yet but I thought I could hear slurping noises coming from the library. I closed my eyes and focused. As caretaker, the House was supposed to be under my influence…kinda sorta. Call it fifty-fifty in terms of control. Alright, seventy-thirty but I was getting better with practice.

“This door leads to the armory,” I stated, voice infused with all of the confidence of a cardboard box left out in the rain. “Armory. *Armory*.”

I turned the knob, pushed, felt a cold, wet draft, caught sight of the rotting wooden stairs that led to the cellar, then quickly slammed the door shut.

“Armory,” I shouted. “Are. More. Eeeee.”

The door opened out onto a wide balcony that I didn’t recognize. I couldn’t hear slurping anymore so I risked a look down the hall; the shadow-thing was standing there, watching me, now about the size of a toddler. I closed the door one more time, slowly, concentrating on getting to the armory, visualizing it in detail in my mind.

“Armory,” I whispered, closing my eyes and putting power into the words.

A garishly carpeted rec room lay on the other side of the door when it opened.

“Fuck it,” I said, stepping into the room and slamming the door behind me.

I caught a glimpse of the imp running towards me but even if it could open doors there was no telling what room it would find. The problem wasn’t solved, only delayed, but if I had a minute to think, I could come up with a plan. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a minute to think because a heartbeat after the door shut, the shadow creature came spilling through under it. On closer inspection, it seemed to actually be gripping my shadow with one murky hand like a skateboarder holding onto a garbage truck.

“Hckhk,” I shouted, too freaked out to form any words with vowels.

I kicked at the imp but it danced aside. The thing was looking at the ground, eyeing my shadow, invisible mouth practically salivating. I slipped past the creature and out of the door. I got lucky that it dumped me out into the kitchen since I didn’t have a destination in mind. It could have been much worse: cellar, attic, or the Soft Room, for example. I turned to slam the door shut but the imp was already through, so I just bolted.

Every now and then I would sneak a peek behind me. The creature ran on all fours like a dog, small but quick. I rounded a corner and found myself back at the library. The box was still laying on the carpet. The final rule came rushing back to me: *if it gets out, only blood can put it back.* A plan formed in my mind in the few steps it took me to reach the box. There was a letter opener shining silver and sharp on the reading table. I took it and sliced my palm open with a smooth pull of the blade. Hand gushing blood, I lifted up the box and turned towards the sound of shadowy footsteps. There wasn’t much noise there, mind you; the thump of shadows hitting a plush carpet sounded a lot like cotton balls hitting a brick wall at Mach 2.

The creature stopped to consider the situation. It tilted its head like a cat. I stood there, bleeding and grinning, the open box held out, waiting for the thing to either jump in or maybe get sucked inside like it was a blackhole.

Nothing happened.

I cautiously tilted the box so I could see inside. The yellow-white cedar was splattered with dark red. There were three words written on the bottom of the box in that same crimson color.

**Not. Enough. Blood.**

“Of for fuck’s sake,” I said, throwing the box at the creature and running for the hallway.

The monster stayed at my heels, eating up all of the shadows we passed until it was the size of a large dog. I jog a good bit so I can run when I need to but I knew I couldn’t just run circles around the House with the shadow-thing chasing me all night. I either needed to find a way to get enough blood to put it back in the box without killing myself, or I could turn and try to fight, or-

The plan hit me like a foul ball dropping into the bleachers. I stopped at the nearest door and focused.

“cellar,” I whispered, turning the knob.

The draft hit me in the face, cold enough to make me shiver. The air smelled like mold and rain and rotting things. Light from the open door died a quick death on its way into the cellar. I could barely make out the first few wooden steps closest to me. Something stirred at the bottom of the stairs. I turned to see how close the shadow creature was in the hall.

It was nearly at my feet. I stumbled back a few steps, almost tripping down the cellar stairs. The shadow-thing followed, leaping through the open door at the same time my panicked hand found the switch that I knew was on the wall. A single, dangling lightbulb burst into life. The white glow threw my shadow behind me down the stairs. The creature from the box jumped past me at the same time that I heard something heavy begin running up the steps from the cellar. I dove out of the door back into the hallway, kicking it shut with an awkward final flail. There was a sharp pain at my temple, a tearing sensation like a dull razor running along the skin.

I lay panting on the hallway carpet for a minute, one hand pressed against the spot where I was injured. Except there wasn’t a wound. At first, it seemed like a massive cut that was bleeding violently, but that ended up being from where I slashed my palm earlier on purpose. My face was fine; not a mark on it. My *shadow*, however, had a bite-sized piece missing from its head.

“Little box goblin prick,” I muttered, wondering how to stitch up a shadow.

Luckily, it grew back on its own after a few weeks. I still hear the creature from the box thumping around in the cellar from time-to-time. There are plenty of shadows down there to keep it full but I doubt the thing that resides down there is happy to have a roommate. Eventually, one of the monsters will probably devour the other one…or they’ll learn to work together to break out of the cellar and then they’ll destroy the world.

We’ll see.

One is with the company I did my summer internship with, company 1, and the other is a large multinational company, company 2. 

Company 1 will offer a broader range of experience than company 2, as the role in company 2 is a bit more specialised. 

However company 2 is offering 30% more salary and as it’s a large multinational comes with a ton of benefits along with a much shorter and cheaper commute. Company 2 also has a very stable long term future, which can’t be said for company 1. 

Should I take the job with company 1, allowing myself to keep career options for moving jobs in a few years, or go with company 2 which is the better choice on paper apart from the fact I might risk pigeon holing myself. 

I understand I have been vague, but it is needed, and any help would be greatly appreciated."

Relevant courses I've taken include two 3000-level pure math courses, Financial Mathematics and Math for Economists, econometrics, applied differential equations, two stats courses\* and the first year courses in linear algebra and python.

I am enrolling in the python coding camp to get the certificates that python themselves awards at the end of the course in order to relearn and quantify my knowledge in that.

This summer will be my first and only internship doing reconciliations work at a major bank in Canada in their capital markets division. Is this enough to get a junior quant position out of university or should I be looking at financial engineering master programs?

\*taking one of the stats courses means I am ineligible to take ""Advanced Quantitative Decision Making, since they cover broadly the same material. AQDM is a third year course at my school."

Also my GPA is 3.8 and I have won lots of awards, and competed in analytics competitions for my school. These recruiters are also offering more and while I am thankful I found a job so early, I feel like I could have found a better offer somewhere else. I don’t know if I can terminate the contract now since I had already accepted it, but it lasts for two years since it is an early talent development program.

basically I was in computer engineering school 4 years ago. But it was shit,the exams were literally copy paste from past exams and people didn’t study they just memorised. I had anxiety during exams and could never think with a clear head,i was very depressed,and i failed 3 semester straight with all F’s . So i transferred to MIS school,business informatics. I took programming courses,basic networks,and basic hardware,and introduction to information security course . But i self studied many concepts in computer science  like ML,web,game dev,and finally security. Right now I am doing an internship as a technical support, i am learning about Sophos firewall and later will learn about Azure and cloud security. I am ‘Script kiddie’ on hackthebox but i am getting better, i consider myself above beginner level i solved some of microrrutption ,portswagger,picoctf and participated in one forensic ctf , but i am not pro of course. I studied Mike Myers network+ course and i understood many of it ,and will take the exam in a couple of months. 

The problem is that i am feeling all of this is a waste of my fucking time,i feel that employers will always prefer someone with electrical engineering or computer science degree. I asked many recruiters if this is true ,they said no and said that my degree falls under relevant degrees and considered information technology. But my gf is a computer engineer and whenever i hear her talk about stuff like prolog,hardware,logics,or architecture i feel like i have many shortcomings. 


Whenever i interviewed they told me to just study “networks+web+ security” and that is enough for an entry job . But i feel that at later time at my career i have to understand os,architecture in depth more. Especially if i had to do malware analysis. 


I am a super geeky person and i have ardunio and sensors and sometimes i play with it,i created a piano with it before that plays a sound whenever an IR sensor detects something. It’s silly but it’s also considered a digital logic design project. I am willing to learn about hardware and everything and i am planning on opening a youtube channel. But i am scared that because I didn’t study it academically ppl will think i am screwing around. What should i do? Should i binge and grind on myself and study hardware and os now besides web and the internship? Or should i wait and all i have now is enough?"

+ this job seems fun and enjoyable for me as compared to media / f&amp;b industry work. i get commissions are 10% per product / service sold so im assuming that after (hopefully) building a steady client base i can regularly get $300-500 from commissions monthly. 
+ leave / PH benefits are p dope … 


tldr: is $1.3k basic pay low for singaporean comma diploma holder in beauty industry 
also would like to know if when is too early to ask for pay raise … like is it ok to increase my basic pay to $1.5k after a year? or is that too much? 

do lmk if you have any insight / tips / advice! will be much appreciated"

I can problem solve computer hardware issues (Windows). The reason I want to switch is because from about the age of 10 I have spent almost all my freetime on my computer and feel like I would enjoy a career in this.

Anyhow onto the question, when searching for an internship it is hard for me to step foot into the industry because I have no actual certifications/BA in IT/Networking. What would you all reccomend for me to do in terms of acquiring certificates or learning coding languages so that I can apply for the internships and have a shot at landing an internship/job. "

tykztb,3,2022-04-07,Please give me some advice. Should I drop out of my Engineering PhD for a SWE job?,polymermachine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tykztb/please_give_me_some_advice_should_i_drop_out_of/,"I am a 2nd year PhD student in Materials Science getting my Masters in Materials Science this summer. I have an undergrad degree in Computer Science and Materials Science and started the PhD in a top ten school thinking I wanted to go into computational materials science research, but I find I do not enjoy writing academic papers. I just like to code.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got accepted into a Masters in CS at the same school and this program is also ranked top ten. It would be paid for while I do the PhD in Materials Science. I also have a summer internship with a start up I already know wants to hire me full time for 140k (and it's not dependent on getting the PhD). I could either quit the PhD and just join the work force, do the PhD and masters in CS, or maybe I could do the job and Masters in CS while paying out of pocket. I'm just asking for some advice on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be beneficial to my career to do the Masters in CS and a PhD in Materials Science if I want to transition to a full time software engineer? I'm not exactly sure what I want to specialize in for software. Right now I do a lot of Machine Learning, but I also do some full stack web development and database management for my PhD which I find very fun. Personally, I am a very independent learner, so I don't feel the master's degree would offer me much I couldn't teach myself, it would be more for the piece of paper. I do enjoy learning though, so I wouldn't hate doing a master's and I'm sure I would learn a lot. In terms of the PhD, I like research, but I don't like writing papers and I prefer more applied work. I'm also a little sick of making so little money (I do have a prestigious fellowship, but it's still not much compared to what I could make by leaving). With that being said, money isn't everything and I'm not too expensive, so if people thought it would benefit my career at all I wouldn't be bad off financially for a few more years."
tylal1,0,2022-04-07,Admission to OMSCS After Finishing Undergrad Early?,GowenTheDistance,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/tylal1/admission_to_omscs_after_finishing_undergrad_early/,"Hello all,

I have applied to OMSCS for the Fall 2022 semester and am still awaiting my admissions decision. Meanwhile, I applied to a few other MS CS programs (these being in-person programs), including UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, and Stanford, and have been rejected by all three.

I am starting to suspect that one factor affecting my being denied admission to these programs is the fact that I am completing my undergraduate Computer Science degree in two years; I began enrollment at UNC Charlotte in June 2020 and will graduate at the beginning of August this year. I understand that I am likely not a perfect candidate for any of these programs due to my lack of exposure to formal research environments and a modest GRE score, but I hold a 4.0/4.0 GPA, have two professional internships under my belt and have taken all of the courses that a traditional student would take within their 4-year Computer Science undergraduate experience. I worry that despite this, admissions committees think less of my undergrad degree because I finished it in such a short time frame and believe I have missed out on essential instruction and learning.

Are there any current OMSCS students who come from a similar background as myself? I understand that admission to OMSCS is more well-rounded and based on a combination of academic and professional experience, but I am wondering if I should submit any clarifying information explaining my situation so that there is no confusion. Thanks in advance for the feedback!"

tynrhg,2,2022-04-07,Internship Midpoint Review,SnooPears8248,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tynrhg/internship_midpoint_review/,"So I've been doing an internship this Spring semester with a fairly small unicorn startup. It's been going pretty well and it's well paid as fuck. I've been shipping features and getting my PR's out. Overall, it's been a fun time and I've been enjoying working with the tech.

Thing is, there have been some very weird moments and a very weird mid-point review...

My midpoint review has been getting delayed by my manager and mentor for sometime now, mostly just because a lot of stuff has been moving with the company, so it's more like a 3/4 point review rather than a 1/2 point review.

That being said, I've consistently asked my manager and mentor for feedback whenever I talk to them. They pretty much always say that its good. When I met with my recruiters for a midpoint check in that they wanted to do, they said that there wasn't much feedback on the form they asked my manager and mentor to fill out and both put ""met expectations"". This is one week prior.

Recently, I've noticed my manager and mentor have both shifted their tone quite significantly. My mentor has started giving me more criticism this past week (which I appreciate tbh. It's actionable stuff that I can work with and improve on. I have notes and I specifically try to improve on the feedback that I get). Today, I had a meeting with my manager, where she too dropped a lot of the stuff that my mentor was saying and when I asked about a return offer, they said they want to ""see improvement"".

Ok, so fair enough. They want me to do better and I got a list of actionable items that I absolutely plan on addressing. Thing is, where was all this feedback during the first 2.5 months? This feedback was all news to me...

And then there was this company dinner we had. We went to the CEO's house and the CEO basically looks at one of the employees and says ""are you gonna take another video this time to get me in trouble with HR"" and the employee, visibly uncomfortable, goes well what did you make me do to make me make that video, references a dart board and a bow and arrow to which the CEO responds ""I didn't make you do anything"". Whole thing was super uncomfortable and all the other employees were just laughing it off and trying to kiss the CEO's ass.

Something isn't right man."
tyo4c6,353,2022-04-07,What I wish I knew: you must get job experience and internships. It is the most important thing.,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tyo4c6/what_i_wish_i_knew_you_must_get_job_experience/,"As a first generation college student, I got horrible advice. People always told me, ""College **is** your full time job! Job experience isn't important! Focus on getting the best grades you can! Also, your major doesn't really matter, just having the degree counts, especially if it's STEM!""

&amp;#x200B;

That truly couldn't be more wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

It's imperative that you get some sort of employment experience going during semesters. Whether it be working in the library, the bookstore, or even campus dining. Any little bit helps. Even helping a PhD student in their lab (even unpaid) can be great. You need to build up a few references and a track record of dependability. You can use these references when you apply for internships in your field over the summer. Apply tirelessly for internships. Try to get a bit closer to your field with every new opportunity. But the important thing is: work.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, really think about employability of your major. I knew deep down bio grads didn't have the best salary but I just kept putting it out of my head because so many adults were telling me it would just work out. When I graduated, my best relevant offer was taking care of genetically mutated lab mice for $17 an hour. I ended up working in another field until I went back to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back and got my degree in CS and didn't make the same mistakes again. Now I'm succeeding in a field I love and earning a great income. But if this advice helps wake up 1 student who was in the place I was, it will be worth it. Good luck."
tyogne,0,2022-04-07,2023 Internship,trashleybode,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/tyogne/2023_internship/,"Hi, I am currently a sophomore and I am interning at KPMG this summer in advisory. I have applied and gotten offers from two other Big4, but for one of offers I must reply before my KPMG internship starts, and the other I must respond around 3 weeks into my KPMG internship. I did not love the people I interviewed with at one firm, they just seemed a bit nerdy and when I asked what their favorite part was about the company, they said their own accomplishments or something about being promoted, but every other firm I interviewed with they've said the people. This firm is offering the most money though and it is tempting bc I will be somewhere w hcol. I don't want to be cocky, but I am hoping to get a return offer from KPMG especially bc once this summer ends I will have worked with them for two summers, but I won't get a return offer until the end of this summer, which is after the deadline for the other two offers. I talked to my recruiter at KPMG and the only downside is that she does not know if I will be able to move offices (currently, and for this summer, I will be working in an office close to home, not where I want to be after college). The other two offers are in offices where I would like to be after college.

Basically, I do not know what to do. I am thinking of asking for an extension for the one offer that requires me to get back before my internship starts and also wondering if I should reach out to KPMG to let them know that I have two other offers for the next summer, but I'm wondering if that will even do anything (I'm hoping it will make it easier for me to move offices or to give me an offer in the city i want to be at after school)."
tyox57,1,2022-04-07,Exactly how competitive and what sort of expectations do the first and second year specific programs at the top tech companies have?,DemonicBarbequee,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tyox57/exactly_how_competitive_and_what_sort_of/,"Hi!

I am a high school senior that got accepted in computer engineering and plan to double major in CE and CS.

I know most internship opportunities have their applications due early in the year (around November) and that companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook offer internship opportunities for first and second year undergraduate experience (some are even for underrepresented minorities which I do happen to be a part of). 

Exactly what sort of students get into these programs? Are there anythings I should specifically be doing to boost my chances? For reference, I have a little bit of experience with C#, C and Python but I am nothing more than a beginner. Additionally, I do not attend an extremely prestigious institution (like the T20s) or anything but I did get into a decent public flagship.

Thank you in advance!"

* Which school has a better computer science program. I am interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence but wouldn't mind doing sort of the general cs route.
* Which school has better opportunities for internships and jobs?
* I have a close friend who is going to Purdue, and wants to be roommates if I go to Purdue as well. Is that a convincing reason to go?
* Any other insight from people would be helpful!"
tyrcxi,0,2022-04-07,OK to ask for a raise so early?,Cluelesslama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tyrcxi/ok_to_ask_for_a_raise_so_early/,"Hi everyone! Here's my situation:

I've been a tester at my company for a little over 2 years. Recently, I got the opportunity to become a software engineer for 78k. I've been doing this for 2.5 weeks. Already, I've made two meaningful production changes and have done so because I know our systems well and have coding experience from developing games.

However, when I got promoted to a SWE, I got put on a brand new team in charge of supporting all of our current web applications, while those teams who were on them can focus on new features or priorities. This is the first time our company has done something like this and I am currently the only developer on this team. The following developers are going to be off shore and I will be in charge of training them in and directing/managing their work (though i won'tbe their actual manager). On top of this, I'm pioneering the way by setting up developer on boarding documents and doing it all myself before them so that it's a smooth transition. 

On top of all that, I'm told we'll be getting two interns at the end of May and I'll be their mentor and I'm going to be taking a class/be a part of a meeting to learn how to properly mentor an intern.

ALSO... before I became a SWE, I was looking for another job so i could be a SWE somewhere else (promotion didn't seem possible at the time). Just today, I received an email from a company i had done many interviews with asking if I was interested in the lead developer position they had available (basically offering me the job. Would be for about 90k i think).

Knowing all this, what should I do? I do like my current company and it's very stable and offers great benefits. The other is like a start up, but maybe a step above that. Should I already be asking for a pay raise since I have all this leadership responsibility? I'm not a newbie at the company or anything. If you think I should ask for a raise, what do you think I should ask for? I live in a MCOL place with decently high taxes.

Thank you so much for any advice!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I think this was a strong point in my application – I go to a small school so I’m close with a lot of my teachers!

English/TOK Teacher(9/10): He and I were really close – I had him in two classes junior year, and also met with him as my EE advisor.

Math Teacher (8/10): Had him for two years, we were close as well :)

Counselor (9/10): He knew me really well, and highlighted a lot of my contributions to the school community. He at one point implied I was “the kid” he had very high expectations for lol

Head of School (8/10): As I worked closely with my school’s administration as president and in my internship, I got a recommendation from the head of school, which I think probably stood out!  
 

**Interviews**

There were a lot haha so I won’t bore you with every one, but on the whole I interview well. I would say my best interview was Duke, followed by Northwestern, Yale, and Tufts. My worst was probably Harvard – it wasn’t horrible, but it was the interviewer’s first ever interview and it was somewhat awkward.

**Essays**  
As someone who does a lot of creative writing, (hopefully haha) these were a strong point of my application. I feel weird ranking my writing, but I think the essay quality was generally high – I started writing in the summer, and spent a lot of time on every app. 

My common app essay was about how I love storytelling and leadership, and I do best with these interests in tandem. I think this essay was useful in clarifying why I do what I do, and tying the different parts of my application together :). Other common essay topics were why I enjoy writing, my relationship with my brother, and student leadership at my school. If you want more specifics for any school, comment or pm me and I’m happy to give them!

**Decisions** 

*Acceptances:*

* Yale REA deferral → RD acceptance!!

**Additional Information:**

Well this definitely was a crazy process! I’ve been waiting so long for it to happen, and I’m incredibly grateful for how it went and that it’s over. Yale has been a dream of mine since I was little, and I could not be more excited to be attending this fall. I’m incredibly grateful for my other acceptances too!

One thing that I think my results show is how random this process really is! After the Yale deferral and UNC waitlist, I was really nervous for the rest of the cycle… and then I got a likely from Duke?? I finished this process with some really exciting acceptances, and a lot of waitlists as well. There are way too many qualified people for not enough spots. From my understanding, what gets you in (after crossing the academic threshold, which most applicants do) is a mix of human bias, luck, and the attempt to “craft a class.” You never know what AO is going to campaign for you, and which one isn’t going to vibe with your essay topics. You never know if your top choice really likes you, but maybe needs a student from a different region. With that being said, allow yourself to feel what you need to feel, but know too that the ultimate decision isn’t personal. And it sucks that we as applicants have to play the shotgunning “game,” but that’s the system we currently are stuck with. 

Best of luck to future applicants – feel free to reach out if I can be of any help!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I don't participate as much as other kids in class, but I'm not disengaged either. The teachers who wrote my letters of rec knew me decently enough, but not as much as some of the other kids (if that makes sense).

*My math teacher's recommendation* ***(6/10)****:*

* I had him for sophomore, junior, and senior year. I practically talked 0 times during my junior year since it was during online school, just like everyone else. During sophomore and senior year though, I participated fairly often, and I asked questions. Nothing special. I don't think his letter of rec is bad, but it's probably not that great either, therefore a 6/10.

*My english teacher's recommendation* ***(7/10)****:*

* I had him during my junior year. Even though it was through online school, his activities and discussions facilitated and encouraged kids to speak pretty often. Since I spoke the most in his class compared to in other classes, I decided to ask him for my rec, and he enthusiastically agreed. I think I had a pretty good impression on him, therefore a 7/10.

**Interviews**

Literally 0 colleges asked me for an interview lmfao. And the ones that I signed up for straight up ghosted me.

**Essays**

My essays were... a bit questionable upon re-read. I didn't spend nearly as much time as I should have. I sometimes wrote essays on the day before or the day of a deadline, which was not a good idea in hindsight. But hey, at least it worked out in the end.

Personal Statement - Talked about my commitment and niche interest to filmmaking and how it has shaped me as a person. Very cheesy, I think it sounds genuine, overall decent but not great. **(6.5/10)**

UC Essays - Honestly not that good. They were pretty repetitive at times, and they honestly sounded pretty non-genuine now that I'm re-reading them. For these essays, I procrastinated way too much, so I received good and bad results from the UCs. **(5/10)**

School specific essays - Some were pretty garbage ngl, but there were a lot that I thought were pretty good. I was able to recycle my essays for a few schools, but the ""why us"" essays were annoying to write for each school. I can't really give a numeric rating on each school's essay, but overall I would consider my essays to be either meh or slightly above average based on the school I applied to.         **(4-7/10)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

My top choices were Brown, UCLA, USC, and Northwestern before applying. (in that order, although I would have been happy with any of them obviously)

*Acceptances:*

* University of Pittsburgh (RD/rolling)
* Pennsylvania State University (RD/rolling)
* University of Washington (RD)
* University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (RD)
* UC Davis (RD)
* UC Santa Barbara (RD)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (RD)
* **University of Southern California (RD)**

* UC Berkeley (RD)
* Rice University (RD)
* Washington University in St. Louis (RD)
* Northwestern University (RD)
* University of Michigan (RD)
* Emory University (RD)
* Brown University (ED -&gt; deferred -&gt; RD)
* University of Pennsylvania (RD)
* Dartmouth College (RD)

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

I started my essays VERY late into the college app process. I wrote pretty much all my essays a week before their respective deadlines, dedicating maybe 1-3 hours per essay. If any underclassmen are looking at this post, PLEASE START EARLY! Especially if you're going to take the shotgun approach as I did. Hopefully it all works out for you guys!

Overall, I am happy with my results. I got smacked with a shit ton of waitlists and rejects, but that makes sense with how many kids are applying, how unpredictable everything is, and how much more competitive people are than me. Frankly, I think I'm somewhat above-average, but certainly nowhere near the cream of the crop in terms of college admissions. I did not have a lot of hope for ultra-competitive places since I knew just how tough everything was from my friends and cousins who went through the process.

Perhaps the shotgun approach was not the smartest since the piles of work that awaited me made me lose so much motivation. There were quite a few schools I wish I hadn't applied to since I would not have wanted to go there regardless of the outcome. Unless you're an international needing full aid, I advise NOT to apply to as many schools as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps, and I recommend keeping your expectations low. That's what I did, and I was pretty much indifferent to all my rejections. Aim high and expect the worst.

Anyway, I am happy to say that I will be attending USC in the fall! Go Trojans :)"

tysneb,78,2022-04-07,How do you pave your own path if you’re scared of everything?,Throwawaynotamom,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/tysneb/how_do_you_pave_your_own_path_if_youre_scared_of/,"Please let me know if this is the right place and flair to use.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about my next ten years (30-40). If the next ten years are anything like the previous ten, I can't image surviving through them. Most people would be excited about their lives, but I'm terrified of everything, and my mental ability is that of an adolescent, despite my age. My life has always been revolved around my AP face but now I’m just absolutely tired of it all. What are some of the things you did to push yourself from the situation? How do you stop yourself from being scared of the world especially at a time where Asian hate crimes are rising?

&amp;#x200B;

I love my AP, but I'm scared of her, and she makes me nervous whenever she speaks to me, whether in person or on the phone. She isn't physically abusive, but she is obsessed with having total control over my life and the lives of my siblings (from the oldest to the youngest), even if they are married, have children, and doing there own thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never moved out since I'm unmarried, and AP doesn't want to lose face by having any of her children leave before they marry. AP claims that by moving out, I will be disrespecting her face as a mother, and that by moving out, I am attempting to kill her/raise her blood pressure. When the subject of moving out or finding work comes up, she thumps her chest and says, “You’re killing me! Does killing me make you happy? I should have died along with your father if my children are all so disobedient against me.” If it’s not those two topics she normally fine and goes about her day.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some examples of my controlling AP:

&amp;#x200B;

**School**:

I quit my FT job to finish my bachelors and during that time AP pushed my sibling’s children onto me so I can watch them as they went to work and AP told me that I should be able to managed since my classes are all online. Every time I bring up that I cannot watch the children all day and everyday, AP tells me that I have to give them two weeks notice so they can spare a couple of days so I can study. AP also tells me that I should be more flexible and grateful as I am living with them and they are paying for everything from the food I eat to the house I’m living in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Internship**:

I had a few places that I was interning at and this one still lives rent free in my mind. I remember when I was an intern approximately 90 minutes way from home, my end time was 5pm but I was hanging out with my boss, mentor and a Senior VP learning about the inner workings of the company. I did not realize it was 8pm and when I looked at my phone I had missed calls from my AP and the security desk called saying that someone was looking for me (it was AP). When the time came, my internship ended without an extension and no references were given. The other interns were extended and a close intern I used to talk to told me that they overheard their bosses and my boss saying that I wasn't extended because that incident made me look unprofessional.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I applied to other internships and had an offer for an internship for a year in a different country but I made the mistake of telling my AP just because I want her to be proud. AP told me I was going to be a rebel and gave me the silent treatment until I gave in and rejected the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Job**:

After I rejected the internship, I took a FT job close to home and did that for two years but I always stayed 2-3 hours later than normal as I did not want to go home. I did not use that time to do my own thing as my AP would call my direct line at work at random intervals to make sure I was in my office and not elsewhere. I also had to call her every time I left work so she’ll know what time to expect me at home. Any time I have for myself my AP would say that I don’t have time for family and that I am selfish for using that time for other things than family. AP also claimed that I look down on her because I have a well-paying job and am educated, and that she would complain to my siblings about my disrespectful attitude.  Obviously, my siblings don't want to hear the same tale repeated for hours or days; they would phone me nonstop until I apologized to AP, and they told me that I should be aware of AP's behavior by now, and that I should just apologize and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**:

Like many of you the usual no sleepovers, no friends, no dating but gets mad at why you have no love life, no undermining them, and worship them as they gave you life or else they will curse you.

&amp;#x200B;

**5/01/2022 (Update)-** Hello everyone, OP here, I'm not sure if anyone is going to read this but I just wanted to thank everyone for your advices and comments as I truly appreciate it.

I've come to realize that I'm not going to win this battle with my AP and her enablers (brothers, they're just as bad as my AP) but I can win this war by starting to live my life again. It's time for me to grow a backbone and shed the good image I try to keep by appeasing them. I also need another  cry from time wasted but I'll be okay.

I've signed up for a few classes to brush up on skills I missed in the workforce and I'm looking at jobs again even though my previous job responsibilities no longer applies in the current workforce.

Oh and a big win for me in regards to being scared of the world, I actually went for a walk downtown and you know what happened? Nothing. No one cared cause everyone is doing their own thing.

tytkyq,12,2022-04-07,Are my chances in the tech industry done?,thebalanc,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/tytkyq/are_my_chances_in_the_tech_industry_done/,"So here is a little background about me. I am currently 24 years old, finishing up university. I had initially came to university for a degree in computer science. Due to mental health issues, and me not taking the time to address them, I have completely squandered my  GPA. It sits at about 2.0 I started university in 2015 and I am going to graduate soon, but due to my low gpa I had to switch majors.

While the ship on my major has sailed, I am still trying my best to develop the knowledge of CS outside of university as well as taking some comp sci courses as an elective in uni. However, my gpa is a big weak point, and on top of that I have not generated any experience in internships, due to my low gpa and not putting in the work earlier to make my own projects. With that being said I am doing what I can now, with coding bootcamps as well as building projects for my own interest.

Has the ship sailed on me breaking into this industry and landing a job as a dev?

Does anyone have any tips as to how I can land a job and enhance my resume despite all the mistakes I have made?

P.S you guys can be bluntly honest, I acknowledge I have made mistakes and I own up to them, but I really just want to move forward rather than harp on whats already happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: thank  you all for the words of encouragement, I don't feel like a like a total failure anymore, however I do agree that I need to keep going forward and  putting in the work. "

So I am just starting out in this field, I've learned basic HTML, CSS and am getting started learning JavaScript (about 2/3rds through FreeCodeCamp's JS course) and I'm looking for some feedback or advice on my plan for the next few years. Basically it is:

&amp;#x200B;

Build a foundation in JavaScript and Python using FreeCodeCamp resources for about a year &gt; register for a stellar bootcamp &gt; hopefully land a paid (or part time, unpaid) internship at a decent company for 6 months to a year &gt; finally land an entry-level job at a decent company.

I just wanted to ask, for anyone who has experience with this company, is it a positive experience? Or am I going to seriously dislike my time at this internship and come out of it with 0 value?

A bit of background on me: unfortunately, I have learned I don't actually *like* CS very much. I realized this a little too late during my degree, so I couldn't financially make it feasible to switch studies. It's my final year of study, and my current plan is to utilize whatever experience I can in this field to make money while finding and pivoting to something I enjoy more in life. So I am not necessarily too worried about having the most up-to-date technical prowess, but I also don't want to end up a dinosaur. I'm not here to make the next Google, but I did pay for this degree after all haha. I would like to be at least somewhat technically competent and be able to swing that as a selling point when finding a new lot in life."

I am a decent student, graduating a semester early, but my  GPA isn't the greatest (around 2.9).

I have had jobs since I was 15. I worked the typical high school part  time jobs, and when I got to college, I took a part time job doing  insurance sales for a friend of my mom's. I appreciated the opportunity,  but I found it extremely boring to sit at a desk all day cold calling  people and trying to make sales. I've always felt that if I had to make a  living based on commission, I would starve.

When COVID hit, my school went online, so I moved home for a year and did  class virtually. During this time, I returned to my job from high school  which was working for a swim school. Instead of working as an hourly  paid swim teacher making $10/hour like I did during high school, I was  managing the business. When I started, the school had just reopened  following COVID closures, and I was able to implement a new business  plan, control all marketing efforts, manage facilities upkeep, hire and  train employees, speak with customers and make sales via phone. I really  enjoyed working with this company, but I left when it was time to  return to school. The pay was good for a college student, but not enough  to live on as an adult.

I have also held an internship position doing marketing for a financial group  that owns banks and credit unions, and I didn't mind this, but it wasn't  my favorite job either.

I believe that something related to customer service, but not commission based,  is probably my calling. I really enjoy management as well, as I managed  over 15 employees directly at the swim school and had a good  relationship and much success with my staff there.

I  have an internship arranged for this summer with a major paint company  that rhymes with Therwin Milliams. It's a sales and marketing  internship. I was excited about this at first, but then I read a lot of  things posted online by employees who say that a career in management  with this company requires 55 hours a week, no work-life balance, etc.  This makes me apprehensive.

I don't mind working. I think of myself as a pretty hard worker when it's a  job that I enjoy, even with the parts of the job that are not  enjoyable. When I work somewhere, I dedicate myself to being the best I  can be at the job and to helping the company and the team succeed. I  don't mind working nights and weekends. I don't mind working more than  40 hours. However, I do need the ability to put in for vacation days a  month ahead and be able to have that time off, which makes me think  management may not be for me as much as I thought it was.

I've considered other management programs, but have read similar things  about their lack of work-life balance. I've also considered jobs working  for airlines in customer service or management within the airport,  which sounds fun and sounds like my kind of thing, but the pay is only  $15/hour which is too low for a college educated worker in my opinion.

I really want to figure out the type of position that I should be looking  for, because it's almost time to start applying for a full-time  position, but I'm just not sure what to do. If anyone has any opinions  or suggestions of what type of position would be good for me, I would  really appreciate it.

(P.S. I am planning to go to graduate school online for an MBA post graduation, so I  will probably be looking to move up into a better role within a few  years. However, a starting position with advancement opportunities would  be perfect.)"

Fresher here. Have to choose between the 2.

Background : Tier 3 college. Some projects. Some DSA. 1 Internship with the same startup.

• STARTUP : Around 70 employees currently. Already interned with them for the past year (entire final year of degree) and now they are offering me a full time position. Learnt a great lot from them but don't see anything more to grow other than taking up a more responsibilities-filled position (second to team lead or something).
PS : Damn good office in Bangalore that kept me hooked to going to office even with remote option available.

• KPMG : Has varied project options and choice to work on multiple tech stacks. Also, the Big 4 name on the resume helps probably. Better learning structure due to huge organization and better connections. More growth opportunities due to diverse client-work. Exposure to financial world as well (that's a plus from personal interests view).

Compensation :: KPMG offers more currently but I think I can definitely negotiate my way to a higher (or atleast similar to KPMG) package on playing the right cards in the startup.

tywza2,6,2022-04-08,23 and don’t know what I want to do with my life,Anonomousadvice,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tywza2/23_and_dont_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/,"So when I was a kid I wanted to work in the creative side of sports. Wound up going to school for multimedia production (audio video production, graphic design and web design) with a minor in sports media. During my time in college I had many internships, also did a contract role with a church in the summer, working ESPN, freelance video editing and a game night production role with our local minor league baseball team. 

About 6 months after I graduated school I landed a full time job. Was supposed to be creating video training content. Wound up doing a bunch of other stuff as directed by my boss because they did not have the equipment I needed and approvals were very slow. 6 months into the job after the last major piece of equipment arrived I was fired a week later. I don’t think they needed my role and we’re looking to get rid of me. I didn’t like the job and dreaded going in to work every day. 

I’ve been working a part time job in sports operations I really enjoy. Sadly I don’t think a full time role in that specific line of the sports world is realistic. I made more as a fresh out of college student in my day job than my boss that has been in the industry for over a decade makes. I also have continued doing the baseball team when they are in season. 

My dilemma is I need to make more money but I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I don’t care to do video production like I focused on in school. I’m not sure if I burnt my self out doing too much or have a bad taste in my mouth from my old full time role. I’m looking and applying for jobs but nothing sounds enjoyable to me. I was excited about one role but after talking to people I know through baseball management is a mess and the pay and hours are garbage. 

All I do know is I want to make enough money to support myself and family when it comes time to get married and I want a healthy work life balance. I would also like to work at home if possible, but if I enjoyed my job I’d be ok with commuting. 

The truth of the video world is:
-no one wants to pay a decent wage
-the hours suck
-you often have to be a one man show and do it all. Little support or help
-You’re expected to be an everything guy and handle a bunch more that just video content. 

I’m feeling discouraged in my job hunt. Had I known the harsh truth of working in the creative field I think I would have gone to school for something different. I would like to be in a creative management role where I oversee projects. But sadly most of these roles expect you to do it all by yourself. Im tired of doing all of the grunt work. 

I’m not sure if I burned myself out. If I’m just depressed or what. I just feel lost and it’s hard to find a new job when you have no clue what to look for."
tyy7wg,1,2022-04-08,Guys I need your help!,Indranil2k,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tyy7wg/guys_i_need_your_help/,"So, I'm currently studying in 3rd year of university. In February I got a 6 month internship at a company. After a couple of months few companies started visiting my university to give internship opportunities to students. I applied to one of them and made it to the technical interview round. In the interview they asked me that as I'm currently doing an internship when do I plan on joining. I told them it would best for me to finish my current internship and join on August.

Today morning I get a message from them that since I'm already doing an internship they won't be able to sent out the offer letter. So I just said in that case I won't be able to continue with them and that I appreciated the opportunity they gave me.

Then Just a few minutes later I get a call from my university HOD, he was super mad and told me that if I don't join them in the next month I will be blacklisted from their placement services and the company will also blacklist our university. He told me that by not accepting the offer I will be sabotaging the opportunities of future students. So, I'm pretty much getting a threat from them to join the company.

Also, I didn't receive any offer letter from them and didn't even sign anything. I just had a technical round interview, that's it.

I would really appreciate if you guys could give me a suggestion. Thanks"

tyyv6n,2,2022-04-08,"""Unseen"" and ignored but considered valued and privileged - do I endure it and try to grow or leave?",aizhana,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tyyv6n/unseen_and_ignored_but_considered_valued_and/,"I'm a 27yr old with a ""jack-of-all-trades"" position in a medium-sized publishing company in my country (Europe). It started as an internship via my University when I was 23, I was studying languages but ended up working as your usual intern making corporate memes on social media. I eventually put to use my passion for Photoshop, video editing, and web/UI design and they officially hired me as soon as the internship was over. 

It was actually good for me, as I hated what I was studying and was struggling with depression, and having a job doing something I actually liked (and having the time to learn more about it!) has been incredibly helpful for my personal development and mental health, too. I eventually dropped out of Uni and focused on design instead, giving my all on my job.

I had some good achievements, been given big projects, been asked to join many teams and I'm told I'm extremely valuable in general. My supervisor is actually ""shielding"" me and keeping other teams from working with me, as she has admitted she's scared of me leaving her team and/or the company if someone crosses me. This has led to a few problems, as sometimes I have nothing to do or I'm told I'm overqualified to help other colleagues in their tasks, but I'm mostly left alone in my decisions and given space to act if I ask for it.

So on one end, it seems I'm valued and may have chances to move up the ladder later on (or at least  ask for a pay rise since I didn't have one in 4 years...), but on the other, there have been several instances when I've been literally ignored and/or disrespected by higher-ups.

I'm currently working full-remote while everyone else is doing hybrid, and it's not my choice.  I've only been given an old desktop iMac (late 2013) and had to bring it home in spring 2020 due to the pandemic; when things began to clear up here, they gave other people laptops or Mac Minis so they could do hybrid work, but never got to me. It didn't help that I need very high specs for my job, so computers I could use are very expensive... but the one I have now is almost 10years old and it's not working properly, always crashing and taking ages to do simple tasks. For the past 6 months, I emailed IT, HR, and even the owner about it when I've been asked to, but I've been told to wait at best, when not actually ghosted and ignored.

Yesterday I've been told by my supervisor that higher-ups are not happy about my situation and I'm considered privileged since I'm the only one of almost 200 employees who gets to work full-remote and I'm never around the office. She was saying it as they implied it's my fault and I'm pushing my luck.

There have been many other instances like these and most of them have to do with my supervisor. She's not a bad person per se, but just is not a good worker and communication is almost impossible when she's involved. My ""plan"" was to slowly grow out of her and officially get to manage my own projects, but this time around I was flabbergasted since it seems like the higher-ups are just like her if not worse. And HR is no help. It left me completely unmotivated and wondering if I actually have a place in this. I'm getting mixed signals and I'm just confused and unhappy.

It leaves me incredibly frustrated since I bet it all on this position, I'm grateful I've been given this opportunity with no degree, I love the people on my team and have formed good friendships, I'm learning UI/UX at a higher level and everyone I work with in a direct manner seems to love me and my work, I took certifications and teachers had nothing but praise, I've been given more important projects over the years... but still, I feel like I'm still considered no more than a kid when higher-ups are concerned.

I just don't know if I should continue to do my best so that I could eventually gain more independence, or give up and look for a job elsewhere, risking it all once again."

It's making my co-workers act...strange.",Grand_Theft_Motto,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tz2lsc/my_company_didnt_give_us_raises_this_year_but/,"My office installed a “destress” corner at the end of the hallway outside the breakroom last week. It capped off a line of motivational posters hung at regular intervals down the length of the hall. The new destress space featured a giant black-and-white outline of a koi fish that staff were welcome to color in at their leisure. There was also a word search that an intern was supposed to replace daily, a whiteboard for inspirational quotes, and a picture of a hummingbird perched on a cat. 

Management installed the destress corner the week after Ben Bourdin set himself on fire in our parking lot. It was around lunchtime so a lot of us saw it. Ben was a nice guy, young, only with the company for three or four years. I remember watching him walking out into the middle of the lot holding a big red jerry can and wondering if there was something wrong with his car. When he began pouring the gas down over his head, it didn’t register at first as dangerous. A few people even chuckled, like maybe Ben was about to pull some prank. Then he took out a silver Zippo from his pocket. Nobody was laughing at that point. The screaming began before the fire did. 

We were closed for a week after that and when we came back, ta-da, destress corner. There wasn’t an announcement or anything; we just stumbled upon the new addition as we went to the breakroom. I saw it for the first time in the afternoon. Somebody had started coloring in the felt koi with the scented markers they left out for us hanging on yarn. For some reason, they’d colored the koi’s tail green and its eyes bright blue. Then they apparently gave up, because the giant fish was left unfinished. Un-fin-*fished*. 

Nobody was talking about Ben when I went into the breakroom for lunch. Nobody was talking at all. Or looking at each other. We chewed and digested in silence. When I left the room to head back to my office, I noticed that a little more of the koi was painted. Now one of its fins was yellow. We were going to end up with a koi masquerading as a clownfish. One other aspect of the destress corner had changed, as well. Somebody had highlighted the phrase **HELP ME** in the word search. I went back to my office and stared at a blank spreadsheet for the rest of the afternoon. 

The next morning I headed directly to the destress corner as soon as I got to work. I’d brought a set of markers from home and my goal was to finish the koi finish. When I reached the poster, though, I found that someone had spray-painted over the poster. Now the fish was a black smudge. The word search was gone, replaced with a crossword puzzle. Even the picture of cat and hummingbird was missing; in its place was a low-resolution printout of a single blue eye. There was a sentence written in red above the display.

***Where are you right now?*** 

I ended up taking a personal day and going home. As I was leaving the office, I kept hearing the sound of footsteps echoing my own. They grew louder and louder until the final hall leading to the parking lot. By that point, the phantom steps cracked like trees splitting in a flash frost. It felt like I was being chased, so I ran, adrenaline pumping through my veins, a scream caught in my teeth. Once I made it into the parking lot, the feeling of pursuit stopped. So did the footsteps. When I got home, I locked the front door and pushed the couch in front of it for good measure.

It was hard going back to the office after that but I didn’t have enough PTO to stay home for more than a few days. I tried calling out sick but Shannon insisted I get a doctor’s note and I *hate* going to the doctor. So I returned to work, determined not to even look at the destress corner. My resolve lasted until 10 am. The display was different, again. This time it was a canvas, sort of beige, sort of white. A beautiful painted sky of sapphire blues against amethyst violet and clouds and a setting sun covered the top half of the canvas. The bottom half was blank. Some of my coworkers had doodled little stick figures around the edges, smiling people crudely drawn. Then, in one unpainted corner, someone had nailed a dead rat to the canvas. 

I stared at the animal for several minutes, trying to convince myself it wasn’t real. I took a few shaky steps away from the distress corner to get a drink of water from a nearby cooler. When the liquid hit my lips, I spit it out. The water was, well, it was *similar* to water but tasted wrong. Greasy. There was a slickness to the liquid that wasn’t right. I held the clear plastic cup up towards the fluorescents. For a brief flash, I thought I saw shapes in the water, microscopic swimmers. When I blinked and looked again, they were gone. 

I poured the water out and got a diet Dr. Pepper from the machine in the breakroom. I did not look at the rat as I walked down the hall back towards my office. Once the door was locked, I pushed my desk to block it, then went and sat in the corner. Someone started knocking on my door. It was a polite knock. If knocks could have an accent, this one would probably be English. Still, it terrified me. I began having what I guess you’d call a panic attack. My breath went so fast I couldn’t catch it, I got dizzy, I teared up a little. 

The knocking went on at the same pace for half an hour. When it finally stopped, I called an Uber and climbed out of my office window into the courtyard. From there, I was able to scale the inner wall, run along the low roof, and drop into the parking lot undetected. I decided I would phone Shannon in the morning to let her know I was quitting my job. 

Shannon was able to convince me that I was just stressed out, either over the Murry account or Ben’s self-immolation. I reluctantly returned to work to find that the distress corner was gone. The relief crashed over me like the Lituya Bay tsunami, which happened in Alaska and was the largest ever recorded. Only five fatalities, though. My good vibes did not survive my walk to the breakroom for coffee. That’s where I found the missing distress corner but now it occupied the entire room wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling. Outlines of koi fish as big as Teslas loomed over me, leering, only partially colored in. There were an awful lot of dead rats nailed to walls; even a few birds. 

In that moment, in the distress room, I felt innumerably small and terribly present. My only choice was to fill my mug with coffee that didn’t taste like coffee (too slick), head back to my office, and get started on the Murry report. 

Lenny from accounting was the first to snap. I walked in on him in the breakroom, naked, with his palms sliced open to the bone. He was smearing his blood all over a particularly benign looking koi fish drawing. Lenny turned when he heard me gasp. 

“Hey, man, how’s the Murry report coming along?” he asked. “Also, can you tell me where I am right now?”

“I don’t think so,” I mumbled, backing out of the room. 

Lenny nodded, then punched the wall so hard I heard his wrist snap. I locked myself in the bathroom and cried and called my parents then cried a little harder when I remembered they’d both been dead for six years. Shannon eventually dragged me out of the restroom and forced me to drink some greasy water to calm down. After I finished throwing that up, clear strings dripping down my chin, Shannon led me back to my desk and sat me down and told me to finish the Murry report by five or I was fired. 

This caused me some panic because I couldn’t find the Murry report, nor did I ever remember working with a client named Murry. I had a slinking suspicion that the man did not exist. Still, I threw together a quick PowerPoint and rundown. Usually, I’ll walk a physical copy of reports over to Shannon along with an email. However, as soon as I took a step out of my office, the phantom footsteps came sprinting across the room. I retreated back behind my desk. 

I heard a roar coming from the hallway attached to the breakroom. It was a ka-coffee-aknee, a wailing orchestra of raw souls shrieking in tune. I left work again via the window and courtyard route. 

When I reached my apartment, the dead koi on the doorstep was my first clue I was not going to have a good night. It caused me to hyperventilate. I scooted the fish into the bushes with the heel of my boot then ran inside. That was a mistake. Every surface in my apartment was covered in white felt studded with black animal outlines like a massive, reverse constellation. I could smell the acid-bite of uncapped markers drifting from my kitchen and I could hear the knocking already starting behind me, and the footsteps pacing in the hall. 

I stood paralyzed in the doorway for a very long time. My head is a little foggy, a little swishy. 

I keep thinking the same question, in red-

Where am I right now?

I don't know what is wrong with my applications or maybe, could it be that I have a foreign name and that's why companies are put off with offering me interviews? If you have any tips to improve one's chances of securing a summer internship, or if you want to share your experience, please feel free to share your thoughts below. I would appreciate any feedback! 

A bit about me -
I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student, female, POC, Irish national. 
My grades are all first class honours, average 83% and 88% for 2nd year and 1st year respectively. 
Work/Volunteer experience-wise : I was hired as lab demonstrator by my university, I have done voluntary work as a UX/UI designer and I have a retail part-time job. I also have won awards related to IT/Science in past years. 

It's really disheartening to get rejected by so many companies but then seeing my friends get interviews...despite the fact that my CV looks very similar to my friends in terms of grades and experience, which makes me question whether companies just don't like seeing foreign names...?

The companies also seem really desperate to find interns because they keep emailing my friend who already secured an internship, while on the other hand, I got rejected by that same company - I didn't even get offered an interview. It makes me wonder what makes or breaks a candidate because I'm not that much different from my friend.

Apologies that this is kinda long and thank you for reading to the end.

Edit : Thanks to everyone who has shared their thoughts!"

I am currently doing an AI/ML master program in a European country and I am having trouble making up my mind about whether to do a student assistant job. The job requires web development skills to help another faculty set up a web-platform. The duties do not have much to do with what I learned from the AI program as far as I can tell from the description. But the reason I want to do this is that I just finished a course with a project set up on a VPS, and I do enjoy web development. And this assistant role only takes less than 20 hours a week, for me this is a perfect workload I can bear. (Of course an AI-related part-time is much more ideal but I looked around my faculty's website there is no such vacancy that only requires 10-20 hours a week). Last but not least, some salary can really improve my current economic situation.

I have only one previous working experience which is a research internship using AI. And I am not gonna change career from AI to web dev or whatever. I want to do this simply because I'm interested about web-dev and what is it like to work as a web dev, and some extra incomes.

I want to ask people in this subreddit, is it weird and worthwhile for an AL/ML student to do a web dev part-time? Is this experience would help with regard to my future career path?

My first job was mainly a quick 6 month stint as a data analyst just to get some experience since I wasn’t able to get an internship during Covid.

I’ve been at my second job for 5 months now as a data analyst again. So far, I have no complaints at all. Pay is great, work life balance is great, and I work with a great team of people. Recently, I’ve been faced with a major decision to make. My company wants me to transition to media strategy as they are a bit understaffed and think I would be able to help them out. My pay would stay the same, but I’d have to switch departments and my title would change. It seems like the company is really in need of help in this department and it was explained to me that stepping up for something like this would not go unnoticed. 

There’s a lot to consider with making a change like this, and frankly, it’s really stressing me out. On one side, I feel like I should stay where I am and keep developing my skills in data analytics as I know that’s a sought after skill that will help me further in my career. On the other side, I’m not really passionate about data analytics as a whole, so I feel like exploring a new role / new side of the business while also gaining some recognition with the company could really benefit my career as well.

First, apologies for this post because I know it gets asked a lot. But, I wanted to ask because I'm a little unsure how to switch to IT from an electrical engineering background.

I do have some old IT experience from college (12 years ago). My BS is in Electrical Engineering, which as I understand is pretty compatible with IT jobs.

But in order to switch, I'm wondering: Do I need to start at an entry Help Desk role and move up? Ultimately I'd like to do Software Development or Cybersecurity.

With no recent IT experience for leverage, I was considering the following:

1. Get CompTIA certs in A+ and Sec+
2. My local community college has a certificate program (1 semester) which includes a co-op as a requirement
3. Get full Associates degree and intern along the way

I feel like going back for another degree seems excessive, coming from EE. But, does anyone have any advice on the best plan of action?"

Some backstory: I (28F) was planning an out-of-state wedding last year while working full time in a clinical therapy setting with children. I wasn’t nearing burn out, I WAS burnt out. But I loved my kids so there were lots of weekends driving ~5 hours after work on a Friday, having planning meetings at the venue on Saturday, and another ~5 hour drive on Sunday to be at work on Monday. 

This clinic’s ethics absolutely crumbled during COVID, and had a strict symptom checking system that had many therapists sent home (which I do agree with, in order to protect one another and the families we serve during a pandemic), but when annual reviews came up, we all got clocked for being “sick too often” and our raises were reduced as a result. At the same time, therapists were being quarantined with clients projectile vomiting instead of sending the child home so we could cash in on those sweet sweet billable insurance hours. New therapists receiving more hours than veteran therapists because the new employees were interns whose paychecks were paid by a nearby college. So on and so forth. 

In June of last year, I received an email from our venue that our menu tasting was coming up in the first week of August, and would be the only tasting for our wedding season. This being my first (and hopefully only) wedding, I was excited. My fiancé was on board and we submitted our PTO requests. The tasting was on a Tuesday evening, so our plan was to request that M-W off to allow for travel the day before and after. 

The PTO system at my clinic was down, so I approached my supervisor directly to let her know. Remember, this was mid-June, so submitting time off for early August was overly compliant with our “two weeks in advance” rule. She was excited for me and told me I could absolutely have that time off, but to run over to HR to let them know my request was approved. 

I walked directly to HR, who also approved the request. Great! 

A few weeks later, I double-checked with both parties since there was no official paper trail about my PTO request. Both said I was good to go. So we RSVP’d to the tasting and moved along with life. 

Two weeks before said tasting, I was on my way home from an early end-of-day at work and received an email stating my request was denied and I was expected at work that week. I pulled a U-turn and drove straight to the clinic and marched into my HR director’s office for clarification. She passed the buck off onto my immediate supervisor who, luckily enough, walked into the office. 

I pled my case, explained my frustration, and reminded both women that my request had been approved and confirmed over a month previous. Their reasoning was that there was no coverage for my appointments. I reminded them that my request was made with ample time for them to prepare for my absence, which is when my immediate supervisor informed me that if I took those days off, it would be my fault that my kids were going without therapy. This is especially infuriating because my supervisor could have easily covered those therapy times when needed, but supervisors basically refused to work directly with clients, which was my entire job description. Aka she wanted to punish me and be lazy instead of covering in a pinch to keep kids from missing therapy. 

So I quit, enjoyed my wedding tasting, got recruited by a different company that pays better, has scholarships for college/continued education, and gives flexibility for therapists’ personal lives. The best part? Even though my supervisor took my kids from me while I worked out my two weeks (which I realize now was too polite), my main client I’d worked with for years was my ring bearer in my wedding since there were no longer ethical restrictions on personal relationships after I left my previous job. Now I do weekly wine nights with his mom and get to hang out with their family whenever I want to! 

TLDR; I quit a job I should have quit over a year previous."

I'm also the IBM Future Blue (or FUBU for short) president, which is the Intern event program, so you'll probably see my name a fair bit on slack once you start! 

One thing i've seen a few times is people asking if there's a discord server for the Markham Software Lab Interns, and there's actually one at [discord.gg/yyQucwWCHf](https://discord.gg/yyQucwWCHf), run by interns! 

I hope at least a few people find this useful, and I look forward to getting to meet some of you come May!"

I am graduating with a BA in mathematics this semester and have been interested in a software career for a while.

What worries me now is that in my job search, internships and prior experience are necessary. What is making me anxious is that I was only ever offered unpaid internships, which I had to turn down as well…I can’t go that long without an income, so instead of taking the internship I had to work at the town bakery (or get a temp job, stuff like that.)

What I do have is a small and growing portfolio of work I’m storing away on GitHub. Everything from my first “Hello world!” Programs to bioinformatics, mathematical concepts I’ve played around with, the whole shebang. Even some stuff from an Erlang book my brother gave me a whole ago, does anyone even use erlang anymore?

Anyway, is this a good approach? I don’t know the logistics of getting this portfolio to potential employers nor do I have anything on my resume that will wow a hiring manager right off. I have languages I know listed, but no way to show what I’ve done. 

Thanks for any help, to whomever reads this"
tzd3fj,1,2022-04-08,Should I switch departments at my current job?,zachcal,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/tzd3fj/should_i_switch_departments_at_my_current_job/,"I am currently in my second job out of college (graduated spring 2021 with an engineering degree). My first job was mainly a quick 6 month stint as a data analyst just to get some experience since I wasn’t able to get an internship during Covid.

I’ve been at my second job for 5 months now as a data analyst again. So far, I have no complaints at all. Pay is great, work life balance is great, and I work with a great team of people. Recently, I’ve been faced with a major decision to make. My company wants me to transition to media strategy as they are a bit understaffed and think I would be able to help them out. My pay would stay the same, but I’d have to switch departments and my title would change. It seems like the company is really in need of help in this department and it was explained to me that stepping up for something like this would not go unnoticed. 

There’s a lot to consider with making a change like this, and frankly, it’s really stressing me out. On one side, I feel like I should stay where I am and keep developing my skills in data analytics as I know that’s a sought after skill that will help me further in my career. On the other side, I’m not really passionate about data analytics as a whole, so I feel like exploring a new role / new side of the business while also gaining some recognition with the company could really benefit my career as well. 

Wanted to see if anyone was ever in a similar situation or just has some advice regarding what I should do in this situation. Thanks"

tzevm3,2,2022-04-08,Community College Advice?,sjlvermoon,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tzevm3/community_college_advice/,"Hi all.

So I'm a senior in high school and all my college and financial aid decisions have come in. I've gotten a generous amount of scholarships—and applied to plenty outside of my colleges, as well—but due to my family's circumstances a four-year university isn't exactly feasible right now. My plan as of right now is to go to community college

I plan on majoring in either Computer Science or Management Information Systems; after I get my associate's, I want to head to a UC (my dream is going to Berkeley lol). However, I'm a bit afraid that I won't have the same opportunities (internships, research, etc.) that a four-year college has. And I'm a bit afraid of the transferring process as well.

What I'm really looking for right now is advice. I feel a bit bad about myself—I know I'm potentially saving money in the long run but it sucks to turn down the schools I applied to. It also sucks to be judged by people I know since there's a stigma around CC. 

Does anyone have any general advice about CC? Or transferring in general? The good, the bad, the ugly? 

(For more context about me, I have a 3.9 GPA on a 4.0 scale as well as two internships—plus another one I intend on doing this summer—under my belt. I did 4 APs and I already have 11 credits at the CC I'm going to attend due to doing Dual Enrollment throughout high school. I plan on applying for transfer in Fall 2023 and attending a four-year university in Spring 2024—or maybe sooner depending on if I want to take classes in the winter and summer semesters.)"

The things they do seem really interesting and I am going to take up the offer since it's the only place I received an offer from, but the pay is a little low ($18/hr). I have heard that start-up intern pays are usually on the lower end, but I was wondering if it's worthwhile asking for a higher pay. 

The job posting did indicate the compensation range to be 15-18, and I am glad I got the high end of it, but it won't hurt to ask right? If anyone has experience interning at a startup, what was the pay like? I'm not sure if this information helps too, but I am graduating this May and going into grad school in the fall. 

Any insight would be helpful thanks!"

What AP scores counts for its course credit? I have taken AP chemistry, AP euro, APUSH, AP stat, AP lang, AP psych, AP bio, AP studio art, AP physics

How are courses in London from course in Boston? For example: what is difference between course rigor? Are the professors in London class teaching in BU too? Where in London does the program take place?

Do students generally finish undergrad within 4 years?

I am thinking to study any one of following majors: biochemistry, biology, chemistry, economics, neuroscience, mathematics, finance. Will the CGS help me follow my major and allow me to take more selective courses to fulfill major requirements?

If I decide to take course in community college to help finish the major program, will BU accept the credit?

What are typical internship opportunities offered by the CGS?"
tzgtte,1,2022-04-08,Having trouble finding jobs and I just feel stuck and really depressed.,alluringuniverse,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/tzgtte/having_trouble_finding_jobs_and_i_just_feel_stuck/,"I just recently graduated college and became certified in the field I want to work in. But the job search has been going terribly, I'm stuck living with my parents while my friends continue to move on without me, and I really don't know what to do.  I'm sorry if the info is all over the place, it's hard for me to explain everything clearly, but I'm more than willing to clarify stuff if something doesn't make sense.

To clarify a bit: my field is a bit small (which is why I'm not mentioning what it is, for anonymity's sake), and finding a full-time position in a pediatric hospital, where I want to work, is really difficult. Most of these jobs either only want to hire me for 10 hours or less a week, work with populations I don't want to work with, won't hire me because I just graduated, or are too far away. I'm living with my parents right now, and I love them, but they can be really overwhelming and I miss living on my own. It's beginning to affect my mental health - I have a history of depression and anxiety, and it's been the worst it has been in a while because of this. None of my friends live here anymore, so I can't even really get a break from my family in that way.

In a perfect world, I would get a retail job or something so I could move in with a friend while I wait to get my preferred job, but my job is so rare that I can't just move somewhere and get even a 6-month lease on an apartment, because I would probably have to move somewhere else if I got a job in my field, if that makes sense. I'd also feel like shit, because it cost me and my family so much money to get my degree and my certification, and to see that go to waste because I can't get a job in the field would ruin me.

What makes this all worse is that my best friend and I had planned to live together after I graduate. They worked at a chain store, so the plan was that they would follow me wherever I end up moving to for my job. But because it's taken me so long, they ended up getting a new, non-transferable job, and is extending their lease where they're living right now (which is a terrible area for my career). I know why they did it, their lease is going to end soon, but I can't help but just feel left in the dust. I had to live alone for my internship and it was terrible for my mental health, and I don't want to have to live alone again. They said they still want to live with me, but they'll probably have to stay where they are for another couple years.

I've been thinking of going back to therapy for all of this. But it would cost my family a lot of money, and my dad just had to get surgery, which I'm sure is already going to be a burden on our wallets for a while. Plus, the past two therapists I saw didn't really help, so I feel like I've lost faith in getting therapy that'll actually help me.

So it's a lot of things that are stacking on top of each other. I just feel stuck, and I really don't know where to go from here, because my job applications don't seem to be going through and my mental health just keeps getting worse."

Hey guys, I need some advice to help me decide which program to attend. Thank you!

UChicago (Analytics)
- 1 to 2 years for full time students
- in person, at the business school, near the main campus
- under the physical sciences division (their professional school). Although UChicago has a great reputation, I’m worried that this division doesn’t have as many qualitative resources as UChicago has.
- not very competitive to get in
- a lot of evening/night classes
- more quan/coding based + internship + projects, but the classes are not challenging

WashU (Business Analytics)
- 1.5 years for full time students
- in person, on campus
- not very competitive to get in
- less famous compared to UChicago
- different tracks
- less coding based, but more on business strategies
- no capstone projects
- STEM designed


I have not decided what I want to do after graduation, but I know that I won’t be a programmer. I may pursue a career in data analysis or consulting. 

And I don’t have a preference for location. It’s really hard for me to decide. It would be great if you guys could provide some insights.

tzh0f6,3,2022-04-08,Article About Better.Com,laidbackguy7,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tzh0f6/article_about_bettercom/,"Interesting article on [Better.com](https://Better.com) and their corporate culture.

Cut &amp; Paste

When Better.com CEO Vishal Garg [laid off 900 employees](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/), or about 9% of the company’s staff, in early December, the startup world was shocked by his callous delivery.

Now  a video of Garg and CFO Kevin Ryan addressing the remaining employees  right after the chief executive performed those layoffs has emerged,  confirming many reports of his brash style and harsh words about those  affected.

In a video obtained by TechCrunch, Garg is seen addressing the layoffs and admitting to making a number of mistakes.

We  chose not to publish the video in an effort to protect the identity of  the source, but we’ve picked out the most relevant bits based on a  transcription of the 12-minute meeting here:

About two minutes into the meeting, Garg said: “Make  no mistake, we did also eliminate redundant roles — who might be strong  performers but were in the wrong place at the wrong time, with the  wrong task, and weren't mission-critical.”

&gt;[Better.com teaches us how not to downsize a company](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/03/better-com-teaches-us-how-not-to-conduct-mass-layoffs/)

After  about four minutes, Garg also acknowledged that the company was  continuing to hire, including some interns, in the midst of the layoffs,  while at the time making a thinly veiled threat: ""... It's because we expect those people to be super productive and add value, and if they don't we will exit them, too.”

He added:

&gt;""We  are going to be leaner, meaner and hungrier going forward. We will not  be spending time trying to raise capital. We will not be spending time  focused on what investors think. We will be spending time grinding this  business forward in what will likely be a bloodbath in the mortgage  industry in the next year or two.""

In  the video at around the eight-minute mark, Garg admitted to not being  disciplined in managing the company’s cash and in its hiring strategy,  which helps explain the company’s second mass layoff of over 3,000  people just three months later. It also helps support multiple sources’  claims that the company is currently “losing $50 million per month.”

&gt;""Today  we acknowledge that we overhired, and hired the wrong people. And in  doing that we failed. I failed. I was not disciplined over the past 18  months. We made $250 million last year, and you know what, we probably  pissed away $200 million. We probably could have made more money last  year and been leaner, meaner and hungrier.""

He  also explicitly said that the company lost $100 million in the previous  quarter, saying it was his “mistake” for not laying off staff earlier.

&gt;""We  should’ve done what we did today three months ago … that’s what I’m  saying to you right now, it’s what I’ve said to the board before. …You  will not be allowed to fail twice. You’ll be encouraged to fail once,  but not allowed to fail twice.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[After mass layoffs, Better.com offers severance, health insurance to employees who voluntarily resign](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/06/better-com-offering-employees-60-days-severance-losing-tens-of-millions-per-month-per-sources/)

At the end of the video, Ryan takes over and addresses the employees

&gt;“There  will be people who say that raising a lot of money and reducing  headcount all in the same week are inconsistent — how could you do that?  Well we think they're entirely consistent. As Vishal said, thousands of  startups start every year, thousands of startups fail every year. As a  management team, we are always going to do what puts the company in the  best place possible and that's having a very strong balance sheet and a  lean business that's on the path to profitability. So this is all about  offense, it's darkest before the dawn, 2022 comes and it will be a lot  of carnage in this industry and we're going to capitalize — lean, mean,  and now is our opportunity to grow and to grow even faster than we've  been growing. So while this is hard, we'll get through this, this too  shall pass, and on to 2022.""

The  video reveals what many former employees have described: leadership that  comes across as arrogant in its approach, expressing a cutthroat  attitude when it comes to layoffs, and admitting to mismanagement of  financial and human capital.

When reached, an unnamed  Better.com spokesperson did not dispute the authenticity of the  recording or the CEO's remarks and declined several times to provide  their name for this story.

I started my first job 8 months ago and got another offer recently with a fairly large raise. My current job is basically hybrid or all in office. From the start I just chose to go in unless I have an appointment or something since it's only 10 minutes away and often puts me closer to my after work activities anyways. I do stay busy in the evenings usually.

For the times I've worked remote I realized I can't. I wasn't completely surprised. I was never able to do homework at home in high school, study in my dorm/apartment, even my internship the days I was hybrid I ended up in Starbucks the whole day because I couldn't focus at home. My home is currently (just for myself) 3000 square feet. It doesn't matter. It would be worse when I downsize I'm sure. I've tried working in the home office, the kitchen. I get up and shower and weigh my morning food, eat, same hours everyday, all that keep a schedule shit. It's rather unfortunate for the career I chose it seems after COVID, but it's the situation I'm in.

My new job would basically be remote. I can't go to an office. Any day.

I'm a minority on Reddit but I'm hoping some people in my situation come out of the woodworks to help me out. Because my serious concern is not having a place I can actually focus and get work done and getting fired for bad performance. I'm not sure how I could go to Starbucks everyday. The libraries around me also don't seem to jive with my work schedule. The common area of my new apartment does not seem ideal. I'm doing very well where I work now. So I'm wondering if I should hold off longer (I got this job offer without really trying and was just practicing) and for my next job I should try to figure out if there's anything that could work better for me. I'd like the raise, I guess there's other things I should consider, but above all I'm worried I won't be able to adapt."

I'm going to be honest. I started typing basically my life story to help validate my current situation to y'all, but gave up a few paragraphs in.

The cliff notes are that I (24 F) grew up in an abusive household, with a chronic (medically should have been) fatal illness, and being beaten and R and/or SA from a young age by my father, by friends, boyfriends, the whole 9. I never got to live a life. I was sick and had my life stripped from me before I had the chance. I was worn down and programmed and told about myself from the moment I started to breathe. Nothing about my life is mine. There objectively isn't much of a life to speak of. From the abuse and the illness, I was dissociated from a very young age. In addition to the black spots in my life, I always felt like I was walking in a dream or seeing life move by from behind my own eyes, like third-person. In summary, I don't have a life and I never have.

I can't take the constant let downs, disappointments, false hopes, false starts anymore. I don't have a support system. I had people I thought were my friends, but when it comes down to it... I don't get a text back or a second glance even if I'm calling, begging, telling them this is me reaching out because I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm the type of person who reaches out to everybody, checks in. I will give the shirt off my back and the last penny in my account to you if you need it. I don't understand how nobody can take a split second out of their day to think or care about me.

I have a boyfriend I love and for the first time in my life I think someone actually loves me.. But with his job and full time school and full time internship (plus us being long distance while he's in school), he doesn't have a second to spare. I've gotten to the point with him where I've said my bare minimum could even be a heart texted once throughout the day. Historically that doesn't happen. There are occasional times he'll call.. he genuinely puts in effort to call or text... but it's just not enough.

I've lived my life understanding that everyone has their own lives and no one in my circles have as much time as I do to think about other people. But that doesn't stop the deep aching pain that comes with that. To be frank, I'm not cared about. I'm disposable. I don't know what about me makes me so easily forgotten or passed over or unworthy of even the bare minimum someone could offer to help keep me alive.

I just can't do it anymore. I just had my final surgery to reverse a side effect of my illness and treatments. I was 2 weeks post op when I got home to my mom's house. As soon as I got home, I had some type of reaction to the house. I swelled so bad my stitches ripped open (by inches literally), broke out in full body hives, could barely stay conscious, and I couldn't even hold my head up. I don't know what happened. I tried to couch surf but my friends and even family said no or would only let me stay (max) 2 nights. One of my best (guy) friends even tried to take sexual favors as payment? for me staying there a night... I slept in my car instead. I just had my 6 week post op and my surgeon is extremely concerned. He said I'm worse off than I was on the operating table. That shattered me. I don't know what else to do. I've been sleeping in my car for weeks and my whole body hurts. There is nowhere for me to go.

This just heightened it all. I've never had a life. I've never had anything of my own. I've never been able to live only fight to survive. And not I am trying to stay warm sleeping in my car for the foreseeable future. Because I've been sick and am still in recovery, I can't work. I have no way of earning income and have no way to afford myself an apartment or place to live. Even if i could I wouldn't know where to go. I have no way out. I'm having medical professionals tell me I can't be in my house or I have to do something to get the swelling down, but there is literally nothing more I can do. I'm just suffering.

I've begged for death probably as much as I've begged for life. I've stopped my own attempts part way through a couple times now. On Tuesday I caught myself walking around looking at places like it was the last time I'd see them. I started writing thinking that could help and when I reread what I'd written, I'd written my note. With my other attempts, they were fast and unplanned, I just had the tools and a lapse in ""will"" I guess. This one I'd realized I'd planned. I told my therapist and my friends all of which were unbothered. Nobody cares if I live or die. I think if I did die they'd be upset, but clearly the care isn't there while I'm alive. That's fcked up. I ended up SH to just feel something.. anything.. to keep from ending it all and well.. I guess I'm here typing this.

I wish I could ask, ""what do I do?"" and there be a real answer with real advice I could follow, but there just isn't with this. There isn't anything else I can do. There is no one to help me. There is no one to help me get on my feet. I'm so exhausted that I can barely lift my head, I can barely type this.

I just plainly don't want to be here anymore. I haven't for a long time, but the only thing keeping me here was the hope that one day I could be on the other side of it all. I don't see that anymore. I never had a chance to live, never had a life, never built anything for myself so it's not like I'm leaving much behind. I'm trying so hard to stay here. I still am even though I can't think of a single reason why. I'm still trying. I'm just too tired. People aren't built to be able to withstand this type of life. I can't anymore. The pain, the despair, the betrayal, the disappointment, the exhaustion, the false starts, the false hope... I've been saying it's all too much for too long now.

All I can say is I'm still trying.. I don't know why I still have that one last thread in my soul trying to hang on. Everything else in me has given up. I don't want to exist anymore. I can't bare the thought of it.

How do you give up and still make it?"
tzntfm,75,2022-04-09,Chinese girl got (unexpected) results! What college should I choose?,brittleLotus,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/tzntfm/chinese_girl_got_unexpected_results_what_college/," I’m a really introverted person, and I like Nordic countries’ environments and culture. So I applied for several universities in Nordic Countries.  

I applied for the Second Master in Education program, and plan to do doctoral research in the future. My ideal career path is be an educational researcher in either Finnish higher education institutions or International Educational Organisations.

So now it is time to make a decision and I am stuck between four colleges: 

University of Helsinki 

University of Jyvaskyla

Tampere University 

University of Oslo

UH pros- In Finland (Finnish Education is attractive and has a reputation in the world), In the capital city, great opportunities to do internships and research, can meet some Chinese professors, with best educational resources, ranking highest in Finland, a big part of courses related to social justice

UH cons- most expensive in tuition fee and life expenses, peers may be really excellent as to I felt low self-esteem 

UJ pros- much lower tuition fee and life expenses, small city I like, totally international environment, I can choose my specialisation, choose courses freely

UJ cons-the application process is really difficult, so the admission seems cherish. Compared to UH, not really good educational recourses, ranking lower, worried about language barrier, few Chinese peers

TU pros- excellent city in Finland, with big scholarship 

TU cons- ranking lower, the course structure is what I am not much interested in

UiO pros- ranking highest, no tuition fee, really academic (can get better academic training for PhD application in the future)

UiO cons- worried about low GPA, few Chinese peers, not in Finland ( may not good for future PhD application in Finland), expensive in life cost

**Letters of Recommendation: /**

**Interviews:**

My English listening and speaking is not very good, but I made efforts to reading pre-task about inclusive education in Finland and made notes and mind-map. Be critical thinking and be brave to put up questions and perspectives. Motivation is important too.

there’s also a possibility of my mom being posted for an attachment overseas next year and my family following her, in which case i’ll need to be taking a gap year. but she wanted my opinion first before committing since it affects me. 

grades aren’t much of an issue and i’m confident i can secure a single digit l1r5. (i saw most posts about gap years with their main point being don’t take it if you’re not going to study hard and retake o’s, but this doesn’t really apply to me so i’m still on the fence) 

if i were to take next year off i’m looking for internship opportunities. i actually want to start my own business but i need to read up and gain experience first. i’d like to try out entrepenurship so i’ll probably see if any startups are open. i have some level of skill in coding as well. issue is there’s little chance i’ll get in being a 16 year old, regardless of how enthusiastic i am.  

i’d really apprecaite any advice on whether to take the gap year, how the admissions would be affected and what to do if i do take the year off! and thanks in advance :”)"

After doing an internship at a bank (data analyst) and working part time maintaining and designing servers, I really don’t enjoy either of those jobs. They are too isolated; mostly sitting at a desk alone the whole day.

I had more fun when I was working customer service, tutoring, and even volunteering at an elderly home back in high school. I think I really enjoy being more social and helping people personally.

I know sales and possibly teaching would fit the bill, but is there anything else that would preferably match with my degree as well? I also want the ability for upward mobility to an extent. 

TLDR: Looking for a career with more social interaction and less isolated desk work, preferably in business/IT but not limited."

We’ve collected 100+ units and counting. We need to factory reset all these units before Dell sends their collection team. 

Is there any software that will allow me to wipe these simultaneously? 

My Level 1s suggested we split units and make a crap ton of win10 USB but i think there’s a better way.

We do use intune and have the ability to wipe remotely from the management console but we don’t want to put these units back on our network, and wiping the units during the swap of new units for our users wasn’t an option at the time.

Any recommendations?

Edit: so it looks like I’m going with DBAN/PXE boot, guest/private VLAN and taking advantage of the Easter weekend coming up to get it all done. Getting an intern once we start collecting our remaining 300 units from the lease. I just needed a system in place before things started pilling up.

**Letters of Recommendation**

For my letters of recommendation, I sent a resume as well as a brief explanation as to what my experience was with that person and possible things that they could highlight in my letter. I tried to ask each person to focus on something different, and I'm assuming that they did considering my results &lt;3

*Counselor (8/10)* \- She knew me, I knew her. I talked to her maybe a handful of times a year to discuss small things about my schedule, and she knew my goals and ambitions very well. I'm assuming she just talked about my advocacy work and love for Spanish.

*AP Spanish Teacher* (7/10) - I did have a good relationship with her all throughout my junior year because I was the only non-Hispanic person to ever take her AP Spanish class and she really tried helping me out. She was also the moderator for my club - I don't really know what she talked about but I'm assuming it was something about my love for Spanish?

*AP English Lang* (10/10) - Literally an angel amongst humans - an absolutely beautiful writer and I was told she talked about my experiences of being a queer student in a Catholic school as well as some articles that I've written that I didn't mention in my application. The rest of the letter was probably talking about the amazing relationship we developed during the pandemic. (English teachers 🤝 fruity boys)

*Mentor Attorney from Internship* (10/10) - We really sat down and talked about what I took away from all the time I spent in his office as well as my true motivations and goals as to why I want to pursue higher education. I believe he talked about my passion for activism, stuff like that.

**Interviews**

*Princeton (8/10) - This man literally just told me to talk about myself for 30 minutes - no questions, just him asking to tell my life story in 30 minutes. Luckily, that meant I could say all I wanted to say without weird questions being thrown at me. Definitely highlighted some of my passion I didn't really show in my Princeton supplemental.*

*Yale (4/10) - Asked me the most bare minimum questions, answered them fairly quickly and awkwardly as this was my first interview, and then it was over in 20 minutes. Seemed very unintersted.*

*(No interview for Stanford, despite almost everyone at my school getting one)*

**Essays**

*Obviously not going to create my own writing, but basically, my personal statement was about psycho-analyzing my issues with men 🤪. And how my life has always seemed to have this constant circular pattern of wanting to please other men around me despite some of them taking advantage of me, violating me, etc. Won't go into too much detail, but I think it showed a very interesting perspective on toxic masculinity and the patriarchy as my experiences with gender are very... unique to say the least. Also highlighted a bit of my struggle of being a queer teenager in an extremely Catholic environment.*

*Most of my other essays were about queerness, working at my part-time job, or my passion for social activism.*

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UC Davis
* UC Santa Barbara
* UCLA
* UC Berkeley
* USC ----&gt; Leadership Scholarship (No Merit)
* Cornell (RD) ----&gt; No Likely, did the optional informational interview
* Brown (RD)
* Princeton (RD)
* ***Stanford (RD) ----&gt; No Interview, will be attending in the fall!!!!***

*Waitlists:*

* UCI *(wtf, I was gonna say no why are you saying no)*
* Yale (forgot to send in my internship LOR, accidentally sent all my SAT scores (took it 4 times), and also wrote my supplements at 9 PM before the deadline so the fact I didn't get rejected is an absolute miracle)

*Rejections:*

*None &lt;3*

**Additional Information:**

Yes, you are reading that right - I technically did not get rejected anywhere this season and I am so eternally privileged to have so many options open up to me. Not going to lie, I didn't even really expect to get into Brown this cycle let alone Princeton or Stanford. As you probably saw, my stats are good but DEFINITELY not perfect (UW is technically a bit low for HYPSM standards, didn't take Calc at all during high school even though both AB and BC were offered at my school, my AP scores had an average about \~4). Also, my EC's and awards were nowhere near as impressive as anything I've seen here on Reddit - my only really big time commitments were jobs, my internship, and volunteer work. Also, I didn't really earn any awards at all during high school apart from AP Scholar and NHS which basically everyone has.

I think what stood out about my application was that, and this is all just speculation, my essays and my LOR's just... clicked? Idk, I feel like the person that my teachers know me as is the exact same voice I wrote my essays in, so there was an extremely strong connection between how I see myself and how others see me. Still can't believe it though - sometimes I feel like someone at Stanford and Princeton accidentally admitted me considering my lower-than-average stats for HYPSM, but still grateful to have such amazing opportunities!!!!!

(also yes, I was able to get into HYPSM by complaining about men in my personal statement lmao)"

As I understand that they are many students on here, what do you guys think? As someone who works at a pretty large company in tech that recruits heavily from UIUC, I have seen lots of CS and CS+X interns but I have never seen an information science student. Even the computer science core curriculum of 11 or so classes seems to be very strong in preparing students for industry. I don't see the same topics being covered in the information science core.

I don't want to be deceived into paying nearly 220,000 for a program that is not up to the standards of computer science. While I want my daughter to go to a prestigious program, it seems as if she is not taking into regard a lot of factors here."

My close friend has gotten into both programs and is deciding which one to go to. He is an international student and he doesn't care much about the weather or tuition, just that the vibe is good and job opportunities/reputation of the program must be good.

Here are some pros of Davis:
.
- Closer to Silicon Valley
- UC brand name and  ranking in top 10 public schools
- Better chance of internships?

Here are some pros of Twin Cities:
.
- Much cheaper (~55k vs ~68k international) and cost of living
- Rank of the CS program is the same according to US News (Davis is 36 and this is 34)
- Minneapolis is undoubtedly bigger and better and more happening than Davis

What do you guys think? Does one program stand out more than the other? Is there a big difference in the reputation in CS circles? Is the tuition difference worth it?

Any opinions will be appreciated. Thank you!"

tzzu7y,1,2022-04-09,job advice,Revolutionary_Bad405,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tzzu7y/job_advice/," i am a former chemistry major and im doing ok in my cs masters course ( i started this year) but im more concerned that if I go to get a job when i graduate that I won't know what to do compared to people who have been doing cs for years and years.

i guess my question is, if you have some projects done, with a few internships, would my resume really compare with someone who is basically me x100? would employers see any value in someone like me who comes from a chemistry/biology background instead of cs?

also what if you get accepted for a job but you dont know what to do. what happens to you? apparently sometimes they can train you, but i dont know if this is always the case.

also i am currently doing cs50 and learning js for liek 1 hr a day, but i read that someone said if youre gonna only practice an hr a day you might as well as not practice at all. is this true?"

overall my results were split pretty evenly...mainly got waitlisted/rejected by reaches and a few matches so not too surprised! ivy day definitely hit kinda hard LMAO although I'm not too sad because i wasn't really intending on applying to any, just thought why not last minute. got into 4 of my reaches (USC, Rice, Wesleyan, UCLA) so pretty happy with results!

also, my reaches that i got into were actually schools i saw myself at...especially rice (really love the school but can't afford it LMAO)! my rice essays were also my essays that i took the most risk with and really presented myself authentically, so shows that AOs really can see through u LOL

finally (sorry I promise i'm almost done) i was kinda underconfident going into this process because i didn't have any huge spikes and also my unweighted gpa was not great compared to all my classmates. i genuinely had several huge breakdowns throughout the process where i thought i wouldn't get into anywhere. anyways, just glad to be done, will probably be going to UCLA since it's most affordable and i really fell in love with the school (RIP Rice tho). thanks for reading, good luck to everybody applying, and congrats to all my fellow seniors!"

Help me out here..,AdCapital1308,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u01h1w/where_are_my_boys_at_help_me_out_here/,"We broke up over two years ago, I (M,23) was fucked up after it but I eventually got better after like 6-7 months of alcohol and was just sad the whole time. I continued to be positive about my career so I tried to focus on that, I got into a pretty great Uni. 
And she also got into the same Uni but a different college. During all this time we used to talk and I told her I was there for her if she needed help with some assignments or any advice for her career, so we always talked about those things and the conversations often got to where we were taking about our relationship and all that. So, we also met at the Uni, we hung out a lot. 
And clearly, I love her still and care for her. 
But when I told her this she said she wanted to date other guys and now I’m left here feeling empty. Idk what should I do. 
We still talk though, she tells me she misses me and stuff but doesn’t want a relationship with me I guess. She tells me she doesn’t want any relationship but idk what should I believe. 
Don’t get me wrong I’m not sitting around wasting time- I’m doing stuff for my career, I landed a great internship, I’m being paid good, I workout 6 days a week, trying to get bulked up. 
But somewhere inside I feel alone, and I think I’ve bothered my friends enough with this and I don’t want to tell this to more friends. They have their own problems but I’ve been stuck here for 2 years now. 
Help me please."
u01rku,7,2022-04-09,Switch to CS vs Stay in CE,yuriw99,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u01rku/switch_to_cs_vs_stay_in_ce/,"So I'm a current Computer Engineering major who is considering whether or not to switch to CS. While I am more passionate about CS than computer engineering, there are many negatives about majoring in CS in my university. First, because there are too many students majoring in CS, my school heavily limits the number of CS courses one can take one semester. Most people can only sign up for 1-2 and the chances of not getting into the class you want is very high. Additionally, CS majors have to take a second semester of discrete math (which is just proofs and algorithms analysis). I performed poorly in my first time taking discrete math this semester (most likely going to finish with a B or B-) so I feel very hesitant about my performance in that class if I were to choose the major. On the other hand, Computer Engineering is very similar to Computer Science, I will be able to choose the classes I want and will probably graduate earlier, and I still have the same job and internship as if I were to major in CS."

I’m a current freshman interested in the computer science field and I am just wondering what I should be doing to get the strongest possible resume and experience in the field. I am almost done with taking APCSA and it’s going quite well, I am consistently a top scorer and I got a 5 on the mock AP. This summer I really want to dig deeper into the field and expand my abilities and resume. What should I be doing? Do I go down the self-teaching route and take coursera style classes on a bunch of different languages like Python, C#, C++, maybe even CAD, etc… (Java should be okay as it’s the focus of APCSA). Or do I take professionally taught summer programs and internships. My main concern is having physical evidence of my learning to put on a resume, because sure I can learn everything but how do I show it off? Would I go into web design, app design, maybe even indie-game development with something like Unity to put together things like programming and CAD all in one complete project. Im even thinking of possibly starting a club related to computer science or game development for middle schoolers in my school but I don’t see myself qualified yet and I’m not sure if I can make it there over the summer. In short, I want to know how I can most efficiently learn everything I need to prepare me for the computer science/ software field while getting physical projects and evidence to show it off on a resume and actually apply the learning. I’m sure this is a fairly common question so if there are any previous posts that can help me please let me know. Thank you!


EDIT: Oh my god I am so sorry. I am a Freshman in High School. My mind was thinking something like ""Freshman preparing for College"" and I just blanked and typed ""Freshman in College"". I'm sure that changes the answer by a lot. Sorry to everybody that has already replied. Please anybody who is replying, I am a high school freshman, not a college one. The ""resume"" I want to build is more of a college application resume than a job one."

I’m planning to apply to Georgia Tech this spring (I would enroll as a 2nd semester Sophomore), but I wouldn’t be able to apply to the other schools on my list because they only accept Fall transfers. I was just wondering how feasible it would be to apply to some schools for Fall 2023 after I enroll at GT (again this is dependent on me getting in). Transferring in the spring would let me take advantage of internship opportunities for the summer and I would be happy to graduate at Gt if I don’t get in anywhere else; it would also reduce the risk of me spending another semester if I transferred in the fall. I have a strong gpa and competitive ECs, so I feel like I would regret not applying to my top choices. Is there anything I should be wary of transferring again immediately?"

So I’m very new to the field as a therapist. As in 2 months in to my first professional career new. 
My employer (also the owner of the company) has demonstrated some severely inappropriate workplace during my internship and now employment period. This has included:
• Having me work beyond the appropriate/required time frame each week during my internship (65 hour work weeks)
• Finding and following me on all social media platforms during my internship 
• Consistently speaking on political issues in the workplace and making personal jabs at me due to my political stance (that she only discovered via my social media, as I don’t view such conversations appropriate for the workplace and keep my opinions to myself in such a setting)
The most upsetting was this: I was feeling extremely sick one morning and let her know in case I would have to leave the client session for that reason. Knowing I’m pro life (which again, I keep to myself), she states ,”Are you pregnant? Because if you are I can take you to Planned Parenthood!” Then says “Just kidding.” And laughs. I was too shocked to even process it initially. 
• Having me work when I was sick during my internship, obviously against protocol and especially with covid right now
• Speaking very openly ab her personal life, including her sex life, without me inquiring 
• During my internship, cancelling client sessions to have work done on her house (where some telehealth sessions are done)but having me come and stay at her house past session time to watch tv with her 
And now as a new employee:
• Texting me at 4 pm to complete paperwork (a whole treatment plan) that I was not aware of prior by the end of that night (knowing I have a client until 7:30 pm that same night) 
• Texting me late in the evenings and on weekends about workplace-related material or about tasks she’d like me to complete 

If I even try to voice concerns in the slightest, she seems to become passive aggressive and increases the workload.

Because I am new to the field, I feel obligated to stick with my current position. I also do love my job and all my current clients. Everything about my job is wonderful aside from this, but this is now causing an ample amount of unnecessary anxiety and distress. I am at a loss of what to do and am having a difficult time trying to find a way to establish appropriate workplace boundaries with the manner in which she reacts to things. 
Any advice would be so appreciated. Let me also add that her father is the lawyer for the company."

While on other hand my peers are doing internships, making websites and starting their own business and all kinds of that stuff, I'm here struggling to even pass the semester (i almost got back in a subject last semester)

This engineering stuff doesn't interest me, idk y i picked it. I really don't know what actually interests me. I just can't keep up with all this. I really want to find a path so that i can follow it rather than aimlessly struggling. 

I don't really have any friends so i can't even discuss it with someone on what to do. I just need help figuring out what to do with my life.

Can someone suggest what I should do. I have little interest in game development, but I'm not sure if i should pursue it. I lose interest in things pretty quickly. I don't have any skills whatsoever to do anything. I barely manage to complete college assignments and I'm pretty sure gane development is way more tougher than that.

I just wanna know some basic requirements or things i should learn so that i can actually be capable to do something like an internship. Because if this follows, I'm either gonna die by starvation, which is not what i want.

Any suggestions will be appreciated!

u04odu,3,2022-04-09,"Regret changing jobs, miss my comfortable old job. Any advice on what to do?",Just-Understanding,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u04odu/regret_changing_jobs_miss_my_comfortable_old_job/,"My [25F] first full time job (aside from internships in university) I was a Financial Analyst at an insurance company and I was there for 14 months. My team was the best part to be honest; all VERY intelligent women, kind, helpful, super friendly and nice. If I needed help, they gladly supported me. I guess Operations was just very female dominated, and despite most being moms of young kids. Being insurance, I had great benefits, good chunk of personal time and vacation days off, and great rewards type programs. The company was very large and thriving and very flexible. Though, as I was in a rotational program, I felt like an intern still. I knew I wasn't using my brain very often, and left the tedious, grunt type work. I wasn't using anything I learned in university for work and don't think I learned anything useful during my time there. I also HATED the content itself; just the intangible side of it all. Half the time it was hard to understand because I couldn't wrap my head around insurance. And because I was in this program, my salary, after hearing others my age and their roles, was quite low. But nonetheless, near the end, my leaders and manager were the absolute best, always supported me, always raised me up to showcase my performance and it made me feel valuable, even though i didn't feel personal growth. I also became someone who taught others on my team, and knew a lot of technical/excel to teach others being younger. I value a good and supportive team. I should add that I have low self-confidence and suffer with imposter syndrome.

But I then decided to take a leap and pursue a job in Finance as a financial analyst at a consumer packaged goods industry. The company is also very large, the salary was a huge spike, and I knew before going into it, the role would 100% help me grow and require me to use my brain and what I did in university. It was also an industry that made more sense to me, and one that I always wanted to try out because it combined Supply Chain, Marketing and Finance. So I took the leap. However, I'm one month in, and holy shit, it's been such a learning curve. Everyone around me has at least 5+ years of experience, my manager have 20 years. My team is understaffed, so I don't have much of a ""team"". It's less collaborative, and honestly everything is just so new to me, coming from insurance. And I'm realizing now that there's sooo much more technical knowledge i didn't know of with Excel and all. I'm always worrying about work now, feeling like I'm not doing well enough, disappointing my manager, not up to speed, but I'm trying me best. I don't have any ""fun collegues"" or a team to have personal talks with and I don't sense the same kind and support I got from my old team (my manager is a guy, so it's a little hard for me to connect and go to for support tbh). I don't know, like a month in, i've learned alot, but there's SOOO much more I'm behind on and I already feel like I'm not doing enough or enough. Don't get me wrong, tbh in comparison, it's way more exciting and interesting work compared to my old role. I think i'm just intimdated by all the intelligent people and just behind so behind and feeling stupid and not smart enough for the role. My current manager is happy with my pace and told me he has no concerns right now, but i still feel behind. I sort of miss the comfort of my old job and the company itself being so chill and having a little more younger people on other teams (I guess because of the rotational program). But I knew if i didn't make a move, my salary would be stagnant and I would hate the stuff I was doing, but maybe i needed more time to just be more a student still? I don't know. 

Anyway, this was just a vent. I feel like I made a wrong decision to move as this job so far has been quite demanding. Or maybe it's all in my head and I'm putting this pressure on myself. Has anyone ever faced this?"

u0635j,1,2022-04-09,Any tips or words of encouragement for me?,cakeofpiece11,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u0635j/any_tips_or_words_of_encouragement_for_me/,"Hi, I've been feeling hopeless and really down bad recently because of constant rejections as a Junior CS major. I have been applying since October and only seriously looked for internship this year because I was so focused on academics alone in my first 2 years. Seems like a lot of CS majors are getting offers(including my peers), and thinking that I wont get any internship before graduating worries me a lot. Few days ago, I was so close to getting an offer at Fortune 100, but I made a stupid mistake in code analysis which led to rejection. Right now, I will get a 2 week take home assignment on Monday from a good company, but I don't have any motivation to do it because I got classes to manage and also a hackathon to go in a few days. I always thought I was above average because I get good grades, but all these rejections got me questioning my abilities and intellect. Please share your tips in interviews or how I should prepare to get New Grad roles. Any words would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading this."
u06eyq,163,2022-04-09,Long PSA for CS Majors,PurpleAmerican,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/u06eyq/long_psa_for_cs_majors/,"I’ve been on A2C for a couple of months as a parent looking for information on admissions for my daughter who is a graduating senior this year.   While I’ve been excited to find admissions decision dates, I’ve have also been saddened by the view many students have about colleges and universities.  Especially those looking to major in CS which what I did about 30 years ago. 

I am an alum of UC Berkeley and have worked in the field in many capacities.  Software development and integration, systems administration, and cloud engineer are some of the roles I’ve performed throughout my career.  I am currently an IT Manager in San Francisco.  What I want to say to you young folks is this:

The school that you go to does not define the path of your career.  A computer science degree will give you a solid foundation of the field. But that field is ever changing and growing exponentially.   More than likely, you will work on things that may not exist today.  Your ability to adapt and change as new technologies emerge is important.    Going to a top university does not translate to you having a better knowledge or job placement in the future.   Your degree will help you get the first job or two, but after that, EVERYONE will want to know what you can do (not what university you came from).  

I’ve interviewed many candidates from different schools over the last decade or so.   I’ve found that not everyone coming from a top program can do the work.  I’ve seen candidates from lower tier schools code circles around those from the top schools.   We always look for drive and passion that candidates exhibit around the work they’ve done as well as their ability to effectively work on a team.  

If you got into a top CS program, congrats...go learn and do well!  If you didn’t get into a T20 or T100 school, all is not lost.   Go into your program with a chip on your shoulder to absorb and learn EVERYTHING.   Look for internships over the summer and if you can’t find them where you are going, consider contributing to open-source projects.   Or work on an idea you have about how to solve a problem and create your own project(s).  Showing work that you have done will go very far when you are first starting out.  You just make certain that when you graduate and the time comes for you to interview for that first job, you **KILL IT**.   You go in confident because you know your stuff and be prepared to solve problems during your interview. 

I just want everyone to feel good about whatever opportunity you have in front of you.   You’re not going to get everything in life but, it is important that you have resiliency to get to where you want to go.  OK…I will step down from my soap box.   Good luck to you all!!!   Go make lemonade out of those lemons if you have to."

u06zwd,46,2022-04-09,[Rant] First year student and I already feel like I'm behind,ToastyTheToastening,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u06zwd/rant_first_year_student_and_i_already_feel_like/,"So I'm just finishing up my first year in CS and I feel so overwhelmed by the idea of having to find internships and getting ahead. My only experience with coding has been in university so far and I feel so behind compared to everyone else. My marks are good and I'm not slipping in class, but I have no experience outside of school compared to what seems like literally everyone else having experience outside of school.

I was searching up things for me to do over the summer to improve myself and every website and forum tells me that getting an internship is the way to go. I figured this out too late of course and missed a lot of the application periods for research or internship opportunities. But the thing is, when I go look at past internships and read what they require from applicants, I feel like I'm not even in computer science. I only really have experience in Python and Java and all these internships are asking for experience with multiple languages, web development, etc. Like it all seems so out of my league and I'll never be able to get there. People say ""Get an internship"" so easily, but it feels so hard to me.

I looked at Google Summer of Code cause I heard it was good for experience, but when I looked into some projects I feel like I'm not even reading English. I can't even submit a proposal cause I can't understand anything I'm looking at. Not to mention I have none of the skills they require. It's super demotivating reading about how people were getting internships right after first year and I feel like I don't qualify to be an intern. I have nothing good to put on my resume and I already feel behind even though this is my first year coding. I know the best thing to do right now is focus on getting better for next year, work on personal projects, etc. But I'm just so... unmotivated? I like cs a lot so far, but hearing about how people were already getting internships, paid to code, doing crazy personal projects all during first year really puts a dent in my drive.

I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but it's really hard not to in a competitive field. Focusing on myself is hard when so many people in my place were already so much more ahead than I am. Did/does anyone feel like this during first year? I feel like I'm gonna waste my summer if I don't do something productive like an internship. Maybe I need to stop googling stuff so much, idk I'm just stressed for my future."

u08cch,3,2022-04-09,Internship opportunities are generally limited to undergrads and fresh graduates. Thoughts?,VirtualAliens,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/u08cch/internship_opportunities_are_generally_limited_to/,"For early to mid-career professionals (say around ~26 to 40) who have decided on a career transition to an entirely new industry / field that is different from your domain of expertise or main course of study (e.g. finance to cybersecurity, design to data science, audit to software engineering etc.), do you find it difficult to secure internships to gain first-hand experience for the role(s) you're looking to explore?

A lot of internship / management associate programs are only available to students and fresh graduates with less than 2 years of work experience, and that seems to lock out opportunities for people who discovered their interests, or decided to pivot, at a later stage.

Understand that there are govt initiatives and programs for this purpose but without that, it seems that many companies are not willing to entertain such requests.

The societal trend and perception has already shifted to encourage job fulfilment and career-self alignment, and switching industries to seek that fulfilment is no longer taboo. Does this limitation then place such folks at a disadvantage because they are deemed to be past the 'prime age' for internships?

Obviously there are practical considerations such as financial and family obligations associated with such a move but for argument's sake, assume that these are not an issue.

It'll be interesting to hear any stories and understand the general sentiments on this. HR professionals and hiring teams, do chip in on the business, logistical and resource considerations!"

u097fq,4,2022-04-09,"Is there something I’m not understanding about praises, kudos, rewards, etc. in my career?",[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/u097fq/is_there_something_im_not_understanding_about/,"I’ve been in my current career (Software development) for about 7 years now. Went from an Intern to Junior to Engineer to Senior during that timeframe. I’ve only worked for two different organizations and it’s been fun/fantastic.

First organization I worked for, I started in the call center and worked up in less than a year to an intern for software dev. I was in school, graduated with my BS after 4 years, but the first organization took until 1.5 years before I left to update my title from Junior to Software Engineer. 

I received various raises (from hourly to salary and salary increases). Was given tokens of appreciation by clients, contact centers, and the organization. I could answer or find an answer to almost any software related question. I kept people in the loop and advise of items I saw or changes that we should implement. The whole 9 yards so to speak. 

I started to get burned out and found another position for another company that wanted to increase my salary by 50%. Let the organization know and ended up staying. I did get discussed to about when I created tools during down time to let production fix issues instead of me fixing the data. It was vetted, tested, demoed and what not but it want on the PMs radar so I stopped doing tools to help others and kept them to myself. 

The couple times the company knew I was going to probably start looking for a new position or when someone called me out for fixing a problem with our central system - all the sudden the CIO was at the reigns trying to do damage control to ensure I didn’t leave or quit. 

All the kudos, praise and rewards didn’t feel… legitimate I guess? I appreciated them but it felt like it was to keep me appeased. I had knowledge of so many systems and projects that the information was siloed. 

Anyways, I left and went to an amazing company. I still can’t believe it. My salary went up, title changed, I’m implementing new ideas, working with tons of people and doing what I love. My manager has done nothing but praise me. I’ve been given 2 pay increases in less than a year plus a bunch of rewards and goodies in tow. My lead thanks me all the time and says how good of a job I’m doing and others praise and respect me as well. It feels authentic but I look at where I could improve or have done differently. 

I appreciate all the items and that but…. It’s tough to explain. I’m not burnt out I have challenges which are fun and the praise is like how or what am I doing that everyone’s really surprised/shocked? My manager asked what my career path I wanted to be. I told him software. Not a lead not a manager or even an architect. I want to code. I’m just kind of in a shocked state yet I feel like an imposter. Why though? I’m struggling to make sense of why I don’t just take in praise and instead reflect on what I could be doing better. 

Any thoughts?"

**Additional Information:**

I honestly think I am super lucky to get these acceptances. I never thought I'd get into these schools before I got the decisions. Some advice to juniors would be to shoot your shot because you never know which uni would love you, and pls start your essays early. 

I'm stuck with where to go. I'm in between Northwestern SESP, Duke Public policy, Cornell government, and Berkeley polisci. It would be great to get your advice because I know yall are experts in this field. Thank youu:)"

I am currently at my senior year at high school and will graduate by June. I applied to US universities for Fall 22 and got offers from some schools, among which the offers I received from UTDallas and US Madison are currently in my consideration. I am planning to study Electrical Engineering but also interested in computer science, so a bit confused about which to commit to but thankfully both schools allow me to change major after freshman year. Although my family can bear the cost of both the schools, UTDallas will be 20k cheaper than UWMadison per year. My parents are more inclined towards sending me to UW Madison, but it’s still a significant investment and I wanted to know which school will be the right one for me. Will spending the extra bucks be worthy? I know UW Madison is a higher ranked school but in the end it all boils down to personal skills when getting jobs. Can anyone give me a good comparison about the benefits and drawbacks of studying at either schools, taking into consideration the factors such as location, prestige in the job market, getting internships and overall social and academic life."

Hi guys!

Hope all of you are doing well.

I am an international student. I have applied to Harvard as a transfer applicant for Fall 2022.

I want your opinion on what I will get with below mentoned extracurriculars.

-Community Mobilizer at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), full time job for a year:
I was supporting the implementation of “Women and Youth for Innovative Local Development” and “Women in Politics” projects by co-faciliating pre-electoral meetings in various communities of Armenia aimed at increasing women participation in decision- making processes, organizing workshops and events for municipalities and projects' target groups, monitoring the process by preparing workshop evaluation reports and datasheets of initiatives, maintaining financial documentation(vendor forms, invoice verification). As a part of my work, I was a co-facilitator during the ""I AM the Community"" youth lead camp and was responsible for both administrative/logistics and content based work. I evaluated the participants' community development projects and ensured that proper documentation is reported on time. During the next few months, I will also lead the process of monitoring the projects' implementation.

-Programme Assistant at People in Need International NGO for 1.5 year (full time job): 
I was responsible for providing overall assistance in the coordination of European Union funded COVID-19 Solidarity Programme and CSO Development projects. I was helping with the preparation/review of project-related documents and quarterly/annual project monitoring, leading project-related procurement(purchase request form preparation, quotation collection, vendor selection, and contract preparation), organising meetings and trainings for grant component participants and beneficiaries, making monitoring visits to project target regions and CSOs, ensuring that all the reporting of grantees is done on time and according to donor procedures, drafting terms of reference for project consultants and evaluating them, coordinating WINNET capacity-building component aimed at empowering women to take part in policy- making processes.

-Project Coordinator at UNDP Tourism Development Grant Project:
I have implemented a 5000 dollars worth project aimed to develop tourism in Lori Region, Armenia. I was responsible for the development of project strategy, budget planning, overall management and administration, procurement processes, preparation of financial and narrative reports (both interim and final). At the moment, I have my own application in AppStore and GooglePlay on Armenia’s tourism development with 360 degrees videos.

-Project Assistant at UNDP Women in Politics Grant Project (job):
I participated in the grant competition called #demoCoDesignLab organised in the scope of UNDP ""Women in Politics"" project. A 3000 dollars worth project was aimed at increasing women participation in decision-making processes and ensuring an accountable and transparent local governance in Artik, Shirak region. The main scope my work was mobilizing women and youth living in Artik, making all the necessary arrangements regarding the workshop organisation, keeping in touch with the UNDP GEWE team, maintaining official documentation of the project (e.g. correspondence, donor reports).


-Intern at UNESCO (UN Educational Agency) Regional Bureau for Eastern Europe for a year:
I passed a traineeship taking part in the project called TeensLive implemented by UNESCO. As its aim was to help teenagers with their everyday problems, I was regularly working on content creation and writing motivational articles, recording educational videos for our social media accounts, leading online campaigns for the increase in adolescent well-being, organising interviews with speakers from different age groups, leading sessions on education, journalism, and mental health. As I succesfully completed the internship, I am frequently co-facilitating international consultations and seminars organised by UN Agencies (Multistakeholder online consultation on adolescent well-being, sessions on the socio-economic impact of Covid-19 on Youth in Europe and Central Asia run by UNICEF, etc.) I have worked on several publications which appeared in WHO, UNICEF official websites (mentioning my name in the reports).

-Volunteer Coordinator at the Ministry of Health of Armenia for 6 months:
During the coronavirus outbreak, I coordinated 3000 volunteers, sent doctors and students to hospitals, kept in touch with the Ministry to ensure effective communication between partners, provided office assistance and monitored the whole process.

-Young Expert at New York Junior Academy of Sciences for 4 years:
As a representative of Armenia in this online project, I had a task to understand the possible benefits of climate change. I presented a final report at the end of the first year and was honored to become a Young Expert. Since then, I have been reviewing and evaluating the projects of other participants.


-UGRAD Scholar at the US Department of State:
At the moment, I am exchanging a semester in the USA studying in a New York State University. The US Department of State covers everything for me.

This is about my ECs. Sorry that it’s a bit messed up.
As you can see, I am passionate about United Nations and want to become the head of UNDP.

Many thanks in advance!"

Admit from Stony Brook
Waitlisted at UPenn
And awaiting Columbia’s decision

I am in two minds about attending the graduate program at Stony Brook right now. Wanted to seek this forum’s advice on what should I do next.

My ultimate aim is to go to a top 5 B-school. CS is something I’m passionate about but looking into the future I wouldn’t want to be programming 10 years down the line. I have always had my head stuck on an MBA. That being said, I don’t mind having an advanced CS degree.

At this moment I could come up with the following three alternatives.

1. Go ahead with SBU, work in the tech domain for another 2-3 years after that and then apply to B-School. The rationale for this being that I won’t be spending a lot at Stony Brook and will get a good ROI too.

2. Continue working at my current company or at a different company in a similar software development role and apply to B-Schools for Fall ‘24 (considering my work experience years won’t be as much as Bschools look for in an ideal candidate)

3. Switch to a VC/PE/Consulting role for the upcoming two years and then apply to B-schools. Rationale for this being, I’ve heard that Bschools prefer students from these experience backgrounds. But I may be absolutely wrong here.

Requesting the forum to help me on this. Feel free to suggest alternatives apart from the above 3 and feel free to DM as well."
u0b54g,3,2022-04-10,NCSU MRCS (MCS) vs Rutgers MSCS,Viper213567,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/u0b54g/ncsu_mrcs_mcs_vs_rutgers_mscs/,"I am planning to go for masters in Fall 2022. I have admits from NCSU MCS and Rutgers MSCS. I have consulted many people but everyone has different opinion. Since I have an inclination towards ML/AI/Data Science I have listed the pros and cons as follows -

NCSU -
Pros
- Proximity to Research Triangle Park so more internship opportunities
- Better weather with less snow
- Less expensive for staying

Cons
- Less closer to NY so companies prefer such candidates less because they need to give relocation charges 

Rutgers -
Pros
- More course choices for AI/ML/Data Science (not completely sure but since NCSU is famous for hardware and has more courses related to core systems, I don't see many AI ML related courses there)
- Proximity to NY

Cons 
- More expensive to stay
- Snowfall for 6 months

If anybody could help clarify which one would be a better univ to go to then that would be great. If there is some factor that I missed to consider then please let me know. Any help would be appreciated. 

Also if anybody could let me know the job prospect and internship opportunities comparison for Rutgers and NCSU then that would be great. I am just very confused and don't want to land up doing the wrong thing."

I think RHIT is a good school but I'll be much more interested in a more liberal arts education. Should I take a gap year, improve my application by taking the SAT, doing internships and improving my passion project and then reapply to more schools (a balanced college list) or should I just go to Rose-Hulman?"
u0cl9i,2,2022-04-10,I'm despairing,IANSOAF,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u0cl9i/im_despairing/,"Hi everyone! I'm 29F, currently a university student, completely new here, and this will be my first post. So I just realized a few days ago that I have ADHD and suddenly my whole life makes sense. I have a million things I want to say about it, but since I have to get started somewhere I want to write about my most recent issue which just drove me into total despair. Oh and I obviously haven't been diagnosed yet (will get tested on Thursday), but after frantically researching on the topic for several days straight while barely eating or sleeping and of course not doing my four school assignments that were due this week, I am 100% convinced that I have ADHD (most likely the inattentive, maybe also mixed type). 

Now getting to the topic. Realizing that I'm not stupid and a complete failure, and that I was practically doing the same thing as if someone in a wheelchair would loathe themselves for not being able to just get up and walk, feels life-changing. I have tons of mixed feelings right now, but one of them is huge relief. I just feel so relieved that I suddenly have an explanation for all my weird behaviours througout all my life. It seems like everything that was strange about me can be explained by ADHS in some way or another. 

Now really getting to the topic, I hope (I'm just typing without really filtering or structuring my thoughts). I've never been a lovable person. Even though I've tried so hard to please people all my life, people have always hated me. Because they must have thought that I'm lazy, selfish, rude and immature, I guess (and some would also tell me so). Sometimes I could just feel that they hate me, and sometimes people would also personnally attack me and show me what they think about me. And I not even once in my life defended myself because I always thought that I'm at fault and they're right about doing to me what they did. But now that I know that it's not my fault and all those f\*cking assh\*les with normal brains are actually in the WRONG, I suddenly had the courage to actually attempt to defend myself. 

So here's what happened: I have a very serious problem with being punctual which has been the biggest struggle for me in my life. Sometimes I still manage to get away with it (while still angering everyone though), and sometimes it has led me to getting kicked out of class, getting fired from internships and so on and so on. In fall 2020 I went back to university (a 2-years-course) after just being stuck at home for two years straight basically doing nothing since I didn't feel capable of doing anything before I would finally manage to be a punctual person, and I got through the first year quite well. As in that my chronic tardiness didn't have any serious consequences for my studies. I got good grades, as I always did. (I won't talk about the constant daily struggles to get things done, the self-loathing and so on). The only thing is that I couldn't make any friends since all my classmates hate me. They first tried to hide it (I sometimes wonder if I'm just imagining things, but I always come to the conclusion that I must be a very empathic person and can feel it), but now I'm in my second year and nowadays they've started to direct personal attacks towards me. So far, I obviously didn't defend myself.

So today they just attacked me again in our class group chat but I actually defended myself (even though my whole body was trembling while I was typing) and in the end I even confessed that my chronic tardiness is due to me having ADHD, and that I just found out this week and couldn't explain my behaviour either before. I'm not sure what kind of reaction I actually expected from then, but I guess I expected them to UNDERSTAND, even if that wouldn't necessarily have to lead to us suddenly becoming friends now. Maybe I wanted to hear something like: ""Oh, I'm sorry for attacking you, I didn't know that you have a medical condition and thought you were just lazy and rude."" But I didn't get any ""sorry"". The only thing I got was: ""Okay, let's first hear what the teacher says tomorrow"" (will explain this soon). I ended up crying and now while I'm typing these few sentences I'm crying again. I'm despairing and just don't know what to do with my life anymore. 

Now the explanation for their reaction: For a certain class, we have to hand in assignments every Friday. Then our professor would correct them and send us the corrected versions in a mass mail on Saturdays. And finally we would talk about it in class on Mondays. So this time, I didn't get any email on Saturday and since it's already Sunday now, I got impatient and ended up asking in our class group chat if the others received it. Turns out, they did receive it and the teacher didn't include me in the mass mail on purpose this time. I have no idea what he wrote to my classmates in the email, my classmates didn't tell me, but they were all convinced that he did it on purpose, so he must have told them something I guess. 

I haven't been getting any feedback for my assignments for a couple of weeks now (and have been crying bitterly over it since I'm very serious about my studies and want to improve, but I obviously can't improve if I'm not getting any feedback). That's because things changed when I got another teacher in my second year. The teacher in my first year was also very displeased about me handing in my homework late all the time, but in the end she just overlooked it, luckily. But the professor now in my second year is different. Already the second time I showed up late to class, he started yelling at me and threatened me with serious consequences if I would even be a single minute late next time. It totally crushed me and has been haunting me almost daily even though the incident already happened quite a few months ago. I had actually even been proud of myself for managing to arrive a total 25 minutes earlier than the week before, but I had still been late of course. Our class is 3 hours long and I arrived twenty minutes later that day. 

My scholarship ended up getting cut by my school (I guess those were the serious consequences he was talking about) but he would still give me feedback for the assignments, even though I always handed them in a couple hours after the deadline. That was last semester. Now, since the beginning of the new semester, my teacher started to not accept any assignments if they arrived after our deadline, which is Friday 6 pm. Thus my feedback hasn't been included in the mass mail for the last couple of weeks. But I still did get the mass mail so far, and after crying every time I saw this, I would at least take a look at my classmates' texts and their feedbacks since you can also learn something from other people's mistakes. But now that the teacher isn't including me in the mass mail anymore, even that I can't do anymore. 

And the thing is, I actually tried to talk to my teacher a few days ago. After finding out about my ADHD that is. I sent an email to him, laid bare some of my honest feelings which isn't easy at all, and tried to explain to him that I'm really trying hard to be punctual but just can't do it. I dind't tell him that it's due to ADHD since I wanted to wait for the official diagnosis first, but I was convinced my sincerety would still come across. His reply was: ""Okay, we'll talk about it in class next Monday."" Which is tomorrow (and I'm super nervous about it). That reply worried me, but I still had hope that he actually UNDERSTOOD and simply just didn't want to talk about it via email but in person. But now, seeing that this has resulted in even stricter consequences for my tardiness, I suspect he's thinking I'm just making lame excuses. I just don't know what to do anymore. I fear that even though I only have two months of classes left, I won't be able to graduate. And even if I still will be able to graduate somehow, I won't have learned enough (for lack of feedback) to be able to make a career out of it later on. 

BTW, is this what I'm experiencing what you call ""bullying""? Or am I just overly sensitive and overthinking and I should just be understanding that those people with normal brains simply can't understand? 

And I'm so sorry for the super lengthy post. There are just so many things in my head that I need to let out. I could actually still go on, but I'll put a stop here for now."

Am I wasting my time if the professor will hate me for leaving?",bdpowkk,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u0cvqu/working_in_an_internship_for_the_needed/,"I am an Electrical Engineer graduating this semester who recently picked up an internship under a cs professor who is known for abusing students (its just a fact, and I deal with it fine; this isn't really the point).  The project is very intensive and requires a lot of coding, networking, and robotics knowledge so it was a great opportunity for me.  My professor offered me this internship knowing I was graduating soon, but I had expressed interest in his masters program which I had only recently put together might have been the whole reason why he offered the internship in the first place (purely speculation on my part).  He is pretty desperate for recruits seeing how most of his top level guys graduated from his master's program and phd.  He only has one master level engineer left.  So this semester he recruited three guys including me to intern.  On the opposite side, I'm pretty desperate for experience.  This is my first and only internship before graduating and I have friends who have had some trouble finding work after graduation in engineering.    


The problem is, I know now that I don't want to do the Masters program.  As soon as I get an offer from a company, I'm gonna take the money and go.  The only problem is, every other new recruit apparently has the same idea, as we all talked about it after work one day.  They are both leaving because he was sort of dishonest about the hours.  And by that I mean he said we were only going to be working 6 hours a week, but what he really meant was we were only going to get PAID for 6 hours a week, while being expected to work well over that amount.  Which for me is fine.  I would do it for free.  But most people don't like that sort of thing.  The only reason why they are staying is because we are all in a class with this professor and we are afraid if we piss him off and leave the internship he might screw over our grades (which is probably paranoia, but not totally unbelievable).    


Full disclosure the main benefit of this internship for me is how good it looks on my resume, but if I can't get a good recommendation from the professor, is it a complete waste of time for me to even be working here?  I'm at a loss for what to do.   


 I could just be honest and tell him now that I don't plan on staying for a masters and risk him screwing up my grade which could delay my graduation anyway.  


  I could stay and wait until grades drop like the others and then try my luck applying for work with no experience I can list.  

&amp;#x200B;

I could play both sides and apply for work now, and if I really can't find anything by next semester then just stay for the masters anyway because screw it.    


Let me know what you guys think"

I am 28, engineer, 6 YOE in tech as solutions consultant (firewall, network device deployment, etc), and am considering consulting, PM, or LDP for post-MBA.

**Things I've researched:**

\- For Internationals getting a US MBA, should be STEM-certified degree

\- 3 chances for H1B (within 3y of OPT), basically sort of a ""luck kind of thing"", if not chosen within those 3 chances, even if I have a good job, I would have to leave the country

\- MBB, big tech for big chances

\- T15 or bust (or Foster/Georgetown)

**My questions:**

1. For Internationals getting a US MBA, what is the best plan for me to get a US work sponsorship and live/work in the US for as long as I could possibly get (if that's even a thing), so I can fully pay my debt + earn more than what I was earning from a 3rd-world country?
2. If I don't aim for US recruiting and just polish my experience to recruit for UK or Canada, would an MBA online (like Gies or BU) be good enough?
3. Lastly, for LDP career paths, I think it's like a fast-track internship to Director/Sr Executive Role, is that right, and are there tech companies offering this and is this even open for us Internationals?

Weird situations started happening. Would-be-boss drove me to back to the train station while under the influence. Randomly stopped to pick up his son from school. I got offered the job and a few weeks later when he called me for my response, i asked for more time. He called me unprofessional and retracted the offer. Thank GOD!

&amp;#x200B;

This happened in early 2017, my university course had an industrial year for internships which i partook in. I applied for all the big companies student programmes but didn't hear back. So i went with one of the ads that the university was promoting. Big mistake! It was for a Tester and IT administrator role for a plastic/packaging film manufacture in England, Hereford. I thought great, 45 minutes from where my parents live and the salary of £15,500 was ok while having no rent.

Fast forward. I get offered an interview after meeting the intern i would be replacing. They are also from my university and recommended me. I arrived at the train station bright eyed and desperate for a internship as the clock was ticking until the semester started. I thought if i didn't get this one i may have to proceed to my final year and forgo the experience which i did not want to do.

I see the recruiter waiting for me by his car. Nicely dressed, black suit with no tie and a white shirt that was unbuttoned a few too many at the top. His name was Michael and i would be his intern for his IT department. After a firm handshake he drove me to the industrial estate where the all-in-one  factory/warehouse/office was. After a short tour of the place, we got to the basement where I realised the IT department was just him and the intern. Big red flag for a company of this size. But i just overlooked it for now.

Michael showed what he was working on with the intern and its a full blown full stack program for digital stock taking in visual basic. First of all, i did not apply for a Full Stack Developer role and there was no mention of it in the ad. Plus that is an old programming language that is mostly not used anymore. Just smile and wave at this point.

After seeing Michael's department, he took me upstairs to meet the ""phone ladies"" as he called them. As soon as i walked in the door, i was sexually harassed by a very-plus-size older women who commented on him bringing in a new sexy ""young one"" while the other two laughed. An awkward wave and hello from the threshold then i was out of there.

Fast forward to lunch time. Michael then took me to the Cosy Club which is a pub/restaurant. He asked me if i drink, i said that i do drink a bit which he must have thought i wanted a pint now. He got both of us drinks and a meal. It's noon but thought one couldn't hurt. After the meal, he showed me around central Hereford and reimbursed my travel expenses. We stopped at his favourite pub, which was called the The Saracens Head, to do a relaxed interview as he put it. 

Seated at a table not too far from the bar, he decided to start the interview. I did my best to answer his questions but it was made more difficult by the fact that he was ordering pint after pint for me and himself. I had two and he has 3. The other intern showed up to have a drink as well. While Michael was in the loo. I asked the intern if Michael normally drinks this much and he said they usually go out for a drink at lunch. Uh oh. 

This is when weird shit started happening. A drunk guy at the bar who was there listening this whole time came over and started continuing the interview. Since the intern was now here. I acted professionally and humoured the drunk guy and answered the questions. When Michael came back, he didn't stop the drunk guy and just sat there watching. The pub started getting more busy which didn't seem strange until a Bride came in with her full dress on. A wedding reception was starting, at this point i realised why there was so many flowers and ribbons everywhere.

Michael did not like this noise and suggested that we call it a day. The intern also left to go back to work. Michael drove me under the influence to the train station, i had no idea where i was so i just got in the car but we stopped at the Cathedral. He said that he was picking someone up and ask if i minded. I said no. It was his son who just got out of school. I awkwardly said hello to his kid and shook his hand for some reason. He finally took me to the station.

Before i left, he offered me the job and said he would be in touch. 

A week or two later, i got another interview offer from a big stock broker in Bristol and was hoping to get that instead. Michael called not long after to ask if i had thought about the offer. I asked for more time as i was still weighing my options. Probably shouldn't have said the last part. 

I was going to make my decision and accept it if this other opportunity fizzled out. Michael then started berating me about being indecisive and unprofessional. He then retracted the offer.

Thank GOD!

I ended up getting the stock broker internship, learned a ton during my year there. I also got paid 2.5k more and was in a much more interesting city. It was also a FTSE 100 company which now looks great on my CV.

Though the experience was unpleasant at the time, its a great story which i tell whenever i get the chance. If you end up in this situation, just leave and don't put up with it like i did."

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which was being boarded by the first human space pirates in existence. His fucking luck, he guessed. As the first gunshots rang out, he managed to sneak into a vent. Fuck, he hated vents. 

He tried to get Gexie to come with, but the snake couldn't fit. He was simply too beefy. Two more gunshots rang out. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! He kept crawling, doing his best to control his breathing. He wasn't hyperventilating just yet, but if he thought about it too much, he would be. 

Just keep crawling, just keep crawling, just keep crawling, crawling, crawling, crawling… There! A vent exit! He scrambled to the escape, slamming it open. As he got out of the vent, he took a deep inhale. Thank God. 

*Please, whatever deity of claustrophobia I've pissed off, I'm sorry. Please don't force me through any more vents,* he begged. Ryan looked around the room. He was in the Medbay, and getting some seriously unfortunate déjà vu right about now. Most humans in space kept guns, and Ryan was no exception. *Unfortunately*, he hadn't brought his weapon to the cuddle-puddle, so his Glock-85 wasn't on his person at the moment. It was locked away in his room.

""Shit fuck fuck shit,"" he cursed under his breath. He had zero fucking plan right now. The embuos and humans in the area were already gathered up, apparently. Ryan gently placed the vent cover back. As he did, the automated door opened. Ryan dashed behind one of the curtains that covered the human medical beds. It was the only one open, and if he rustled any of the others, it was going to make noise. The sound of two Russian pirates came through the door.

""Check the alien bay. I'll check the human bay,"" one ordered. Fuck shit. Shit fuck. Ryan kept his breathing as shallow and quiet as he could. The first curtain was forced wide open. 

*What's the plan, Ryan?* He thought he was behind the fifth curtain, but he wasn't sure. The second curtain was pulled open. Fighting was out of the picture. Ryan had pretty basic combat training, and these fuckers were highly trained Russian mercenaries that stole a goddamn spaceship. They were at least twenty levels of badass higher than himself, each. 

The third curtain was pulled open. *Fuck fuck fuck fuck- Wait!* he thought. *If I can sneak under the curtain as he walks over, maybe he won't spot me!...* Okay, maybe it wasn't the saving grace he had hoped for, but better than nothing. 

The fourth curtain was pulled open. The pirate was probably taking a second to check the room. Ryan waited until he thought he was sure the pirate would have started to move to the next. He quickly scrambled under the curtain as soon as the perceived opening arrived. Ryan moved as fast as he could afford. *Please don't make a noise, please don't make a noise, please don't make a noise,* he begged the curtain. 

He had wiggled most of his lower body under. So far, so good, he believed. The gun poked from around the corner. Ryan wasn't going to make it. He was almost through, as the gun gradually pointed in his direction, its owner sweeping the area with it.

""Over here!"" called the other mercenary. The gun turned away and Ryan finished slipping under the curtain. He didn't waste the chance he had. Ryan got up and crept out of the room as the two mercenaries investigated the loose bolts on the vent. As soon as he was sure he was out of earshot, he started to run to his room. Or should he run for the escape pods? The comms? Fuck! Maybe the engine room, and threaten them all with the heat of a dwarf star? No, too drastic, and too easy to just call his bluff. So. Comms, gun or escape. *Fuck.*"

When I was a small boy, my big brother bought a Metal Slug arcade machine for our flat. It was a a ploy--I was only allowed to play if I did my homework and my chores--and it worked perfectly. I soon realized that if I paid attention in class and put effort in early, I could quickly finish my maths and science, though literature took a bit longer.

Of course it did. You think Shakespeare is dense and very long? Try Tolstoy. Your ""Above the Abyss in the Rye"" is just a magazine compared to my middle school reading. 

I appreciate it, I suppose. It made me a well-read man and even now, I pride myself on having an attention span longer than that of a goldfish, despite being a ""techie"" and programmer. And all that work, all that Metal Slug, it kept my mind occupied. Kept me from dwelling too much on the flashes of memory I had from when I was younger, from when before my big brother took me in. 

I don't want to talk about that.

The point is, as a kid, I had my Metal Slug. I must have spent hours on it, every night that I could, running, jumping, shooting, searching for the heavy machinegun, that big bold ""H"" box that let me lay waste to my enemies, trying to find all the secrets and free all the bearded prisoners of war, all before the final theme song and the announcement, ""Mission Complete!"" It was my favorite hobby--my obsession--and it kept me busy. In addition to suppressing those memories of screaming and shouting and mother ""falling"" down the stairs, it kept me from wondering how the Hell my big brother, a orphan from the middle of nowhere like me, had managed to afford a flat in the fanciest quarter of Tver, not all that long after the fall of the Soviet Union. 

Maybe it was because I was a child. But that's no excuse. If I may flatter myself, I am a little intelligent--at least I was for a child--and that's why when my Metal Slug began to malfunction, when my avatar began to jump even if the button wasn't pressed and shot not at all, I did not just give up and cry or call someone for help. I opened up the cabinet and began to examine things. I had just released the circuit board connecting to the controls when my brother came and asked me just what the Hell I was doing. 

In hindsight, I should have seen it. The way he spoke, the way he shook, the red in his face--he was stressed. More than stressed, he was terrified. At the time, though, I simply crawled out, covered in dust, and held out the circuit board. 

""I had a theory,"" I said--yes, I spoke like that, in fact I still sometimes speak like that, ""and it was correct. Look...""

I showed him how the ""jump"" contact was corroded to the ground trace, the return trace. The result was obvious: the machine understood that the ""jump"" button was always down. As for ""shoot,"" the trace was weak and the integrated circuit that connected to it had popped out somewhat.

""Good work, kid,"" my brother said. He forced a smile. ""Now, how do we fix it?""

""I'll need some supplies,"" I said. I'd been reading a magazine about electronics repair, I explained, and I believed that some scrubbing with isopropyl would clear the corrosion. A little soldering would fix the broken contact. After that, it would be good practice to spray on some clear coat to protect the circuitry, and keep some silver paint on hand in case any of my meddling had scratched a trace.

""It sounds very expensive,"" my brother said.

""Not really,"" I said casually--but he thrust fistfuls of cash toward me regardless. The equivalent of thousands of dollars--a small fortune at the time--and laughed loudly, a rare thing for a Russian, any Russian, let alone a poor kid like him. He wiped his tears and got me to my feet and into my coat and pushed me toward the door.

He wanted to tell me something. Even then I knew it. Maybe a warning, a farewell, a few final words of advice. Maybe even an admission that he wasn't really my big brother after all, maybe instruction to do my homework before playing video games no matter what happened or where life took me. Instead, he just turned me around and kicked me in the ass, and said he'd see me soon. 

Whatever. I made the normal walk to the city center, passing the normal drug addicts with their normal groans. I went to the normal store and made my abnormal purchase from the normal shopkeep, and then I went back home. And that is where any semblance of normality in my childhood--in my life so far--ended.

The cops had him on his knees, guns to the back of his head. They were shouting at him--beating him--accusing him of being a drug dealer, a narkotogrovyets. I ran toward them, yelling that it was ridiculous, until they took out the duffel bag he kept under his bed and shook the bags of cocaine out of it. 

They later claimed that he lunged at them. That he assaulted them or something. I don't know if it's true, but if it is, I don't blame him. Better to go down fighting and they'd have found an excuse anyway, even if he hadn't. Anyway, they... shot him, then and there, in the back of the head. I saw the spray of blood before I heard that crack of the gunshot and felt a cold chemical trickle of profound loss and horror as the first, last, and only person who had ever cared about me in life, just... ended, right in front of me. 

And I never did get to fix my Metal Slug machine, or to show my big brother that I was right, that he had raised me right after all.

Ramzan was my best friend through university and into the early parts of our careers. He was a Chechen, a tall long-limbed fellow from a fiercely pro-Russian family, though we rarely spoke about politics. We were too busy--with studies, and part-time jobs, and then with internships at what claimed to be a software research lab. There, one of our first projects was to build a self-replicating patch tool to--we were told--throw warnings in electrical grid installations, in case they found themselves attacked by hackers.

I won't bore you with the details. But I should have seen it then and there. The significant part of that project was that it had to infiltrate, self-replicate, and implant code. The error messages and the logic to throw them was elementary coding--and it is now clear to me that the next team, whoever they were, removed that and replaced it with code that was far more malicious.

That's how we became your worst nightmare, the bogeyman that your leaders warn you about, a real, vicious threat that actually exists: Russian hackers. 

We were good at it. We must have been, because almost immediately, we found ourselves promoted, honored, showered with gifts and expensive luxuries and parties. These invariably began with propaganda. Infographics of how many American military bases there were overseas, how they were situated so close to our borders. Videos of bodies, of gunbattles, of American soldiers brutalizing civilians across the world. There were obvious racial undertones to all of this--the perpetrators of the worst violence, the most senseless and savage among them, were visibly Black soldiers. 

We yelled with appropriate rage. Swore with appropriate severity. And then the propaganda finished and it was time to get wasted. Ironic--there was marijuana and cocaine and krokodil at half of these parties, in open view, used by leaders and executives as well as boots-on-the-ground workers like us, as well as the ""dancers"" we invited to party with us. 

Ramzan didn't partake, of course, being a Muslim. A little vodka now and then, a voditsa, that's all he ever had. We were living the life and on a steep upward trajectory--forget that I am an ethnic Pole and that he was an ethnic Chechen, we must have passed whatever background checks we did, either that or we were so good and so loyal that they didn't care.  We were a team--a duo capable of taking on the world, it felt like. 

In fact, those were the precise words they used to us when they told us that we were going to Syria. 

---

It was my first time in a military plane. My first time in any plane at all, actually, and it was a big ass Antonov. It was built in the Soviet era and likely last maintained there too, the damn thing vibrated so much it felt like it could come apart at any time. I had some noise-cancelling headphones--a luxury I never thought I'd be able to afford in my wildest dreams--but it didn't stop my teeth from rattling in my skull. 

Ramzan, on the other hand, seemed to be totally calm. Totally collected. Smiling a strange smile, I thought, but he was a nerdy awkward man like me--a literal hacker. It had started in the days leading up to our flight... I had become a human pincushion, they made me get so many shots, and Ramzan... they had kept him separately, and for a lot longer, in a facility across from my simple hospital room. More than once I swore I heard screaming there, and begging... but I was told it was nothing, my ears were playing tricks on me.

Funny. At the time, I told myself I was crazy. What were they doing, experimenting on him medically? But no medical experiment could take hold in so few days. Of course, I didn't consider that what they did to him might not be an experiment. It might be a routine operation.

Ramzan had his prayer cap on and his rosary in his hand, praying in presumably Arabic, though it... didn't really sound like it. It didn't really sound like Chechen, either. Something about him... it made me feel a twinge of foreboding. Or, to be frank, terror. The way he looked at me was different somehow. It was more calculating, there was none of the warmth and friendship we'd built over the years. Just a sort of weighing, or analyzing... how many steps did he have to take before he could get his hands around my throat, or maybe that was too slow, maybe he was playing with the fork in his hands to figure out how aerodynamic it was, where he'd have to aim to throw it into my eye...

Maybe I was just paranoid. Just stressed from my first flight. I had work to do. I opened up the binder of information they had provided me. Reviewed it as best as I could. Now that I was trusted a little bit more in the organization, they seemed to provide me with more information, more accurate information. Therefore, I trusted them a little bit more. And I believe the information they provided me was fundamentally accurate.

The Americans have shut down a chemical production plant with one of their worms. Worst yet, they actually found a way to overheat some hardware and start a fire which actually took the plant offline, air-gapping it from the rest of the internet. Your job is to fix the plant... get it back online, get it back up to speed, and, if possible, capture the worm and bring it home for analysis.

I also had a schematic of the plant. A simple interface control block diagram, nothing more. What was remarkable to me was that the system operated not unlike a rocket engine, with a series of tanks and a helium bottle connected to each other. The helium entered the tanks when they released their fluid, and thus maintained pressure. (I knew that this was similar to how a rocket engine operates because I'm a total nerd.)

And again, I was so wrapped up in what I was doing that what was obvious, was not obvious to me. A chemical production plant modeled after a rocket engine. It was as if you only had so many engineers who were designing the whole operation, because you only trusted so many engineers. 

---

We got our passports stamped in Damascus, got into perhaps ten UAZs and without further ado, drove out into the desert in a convoy. As far as Ramzan and I could tell, we were the only civilians in the group, the only ones with more than two brain cells to rub together. We tried to strike up a conversation with the conscript who drove our vehicle, but all he wanted to talk about was football and farting and fucking. So I tried to strike up a conversation with Ramzan, but something about it felt... off. Or forced. Like he was there, but not all there. Or that he was on drugs or something, the way he looked around and scratched at himself just wasn't right. And the way he gripped at the shortened Kalashnikov they had given him... I didn't like it.

I don't fucking like guns. Never had, since the incident with my brother. Still, I had the damn thing across my chest too. Along with body armor and extra magazines. The only real technical gear we had was in our backpacks, a few laptops and hard drives, plus a soldering kit, multimeter, screwdrivers and a minuscule welding torch. We didn't have to make a perfect, pristine, beautiful repair, we were told. Just had to get the plant up and running for a little bit longer.

I remember. I had never felt heat like that before, not anywhere, and it was so damn dry and sandy, the sun a searing torch on my skin. At one point, the driver gave me and Ramzan each a shemagh, a length of cloth to wrap around our faces, and that helped somewhat. I thanked him for that--despite his flaws, he wasn't a bad guy. Didn't deserve what happened to him. 

Funny thing about all the soldiers we met. They were soldiers, it was obvious to me, conscripts most of them, Spetsnaz some, they were the harder ones with bigger muscles. What was strange was that none of them actually wore our national insignia. Sure, they wore uniforms and addressed each other like military men, but not one of them had a nametape, or a flag, or any of that. It's obvious why now--this was a black op, at least to a degree, or these guys were formally affiliated only with some mercenary group to launder any direct Russian government involvement out of the whole thing. 

Even I knew better than to actually ask about that. I kept my mouth shut and simply spent the drive studying the material I'd been given. 

We crossed enough emptiness eventually, I suppose. Up and over a dismal hill of sand and rock, we found the place: a miserable concrete box in the middle of nowhere, flanked by a series of noisy sputtering gas generators. There was nothing there, not even camels, not even camel spiders, it was so isolated. Just a few other mercs, or not-soldiers, and a gaggle of scientists and technicians in labcoats with their hands cuffed behind him.

That too should have told us something. The Battle of Kasham had been fought and lost just a few months ago, and out here there was no danger of killing Russian regulars or civilians. If this really was ""just"" a chemical production plant--why the Hell not blow it to Kingdom Come, along with everyone in it?

As usual, though, I was so focused on what I was doing that I did not realize what I was doing. The soldiers--or more accurately, the not-soldiers, told us to go and get to work and so we did, passing the cuffed Syrians without a glance. I entered, plugged a laptop into the server rack, slung my own Kalashnikov over my back, and began to log in.

As usual. Your profile needs to set up, now sit back for one minute or one hour, who knew how long it'd actually be.

""Blyat,"" I swore. Turned to Ramzan. ""Typical industrial-types. They make a system that's only compatible with Windows. If we were on Linux, I bet we'd be done by now.""

Ramzan appeared to be looking this way and that, scarcely paying attention to me. When he looked at me, he looked through me, his eyes almost vibrating. It was as if he wasn't human. In fact, he wasn't human. 

""Linux?"" he asked. ""What's that?""

A bad joke even for a programmer, I reasoned. Must be stressed from the flight and what we were doing. No matter. I laughed it off and got back to work. ""Go and see if you can repair the the damage from the fire,"" I told Ramzan. I believed he'd be able to at least take care of that on his own. And that way, I could focus on my job.

In minutes I was cross-legged on the sandswept floors. The worm had devoured the system--and I knew I couldn't rebuild the code from scratch, that'd take weeks and it was a job for a professional, someone with experience with this sort of gear. I had to hunt for the vestiges of code... the backups, the lingering signatures the Americans hadn't thought to destroy. I was doing forensic programming, I realized. Not bad for an orphan from Tver.

Finally I pieced together enough of the original code to have something of a product. It was afternoon by then--I stopped to piss and have some water--and poked my head outside. The not-soldiers were still there, smoking, Kalashnikovs either aimed low or over their shoulders casually. No signs of trouble. No signs of anything at all.

A few parts of my program hit errors. Fucking amateurish, a missing semicolon here, a typo there. Whatever. I tested out a few modules and looked up into the heart of the factory. Massive tanks, not dissimilar in appearance to a distillery, most of them coated in a film of condensed water. I reached out and touched one--it was cold.

Huh, I realized. The tanks were cryogenic. Hundreds of degrees below zero, even out here in the desert. That explained why they needed so much damn power. I briefly wondered what needed to be kept so cold--then I decided I didn't need to know.

My code fixed, I ran a few tests. Light up that LED, fire up that generator. Crank up that cryo tank, make that screen flash on and off twice. All successes, all passes, all proof that I at least had something that worked. Time to check on Ramzan. He had had hours by now to fix the damage--I expected him to be mostly done.

I made my way to the server racks and to my surprise, barely any work had been done at all, and Ramzan was nowhere to be found. What the Hell--I heard shouting outside and a series of explosions and ran upstairs to look--

I peered at the scene from behind a wall around the perimeter of the roof. Ramzan was there. And the not-soldiers, and the Syrians in their labcoats, their hands cuffed behind their backs, begging for mercy. Ramzan had his gun on them, the barrel still smoking, and he was laughing. Laughing and grinning at the dead and dying bodies strewn about the desert. And then he began to fire again.

One of the not-soldiers tackled him. Yelled at him--we're not supposed to kill these guys, you idiot, just yell at them and intimidate them and figure out what the Hell went wrong. Ramzan turned to the kid, our stupid but friendly driver--and then struck him with the butt of his rifle. He went down, bleeding from the mouth, and didn't get up.

The rest of the not-soldiers turned on Ramzan, aiming their weapons and telling him to drop his rifle. He seemed to turn, grinning, licking his lips, licking his face somehow--his tongue had grown--and then he began to shoot.

It seemed that each of his bullets hit home. A burst on the right dropped the nearest merc. A burst on the left made another two dive for cover. And then he was running with lightning speed, darting this way and that, firing his weapon at the fleeing lab staff and the mercenaries alike.

I yelled at him--tried to get him to stop, or at least ask him what the Hell he was doing. If he heard me, he made no sign of it. So I aimed my rifle at him and fired--hit myself in the jaw with the butt, swore, and fired from the hip instead.

For a moment, Ramzan and I made eye contact. Or whatever Ramzan was and I made eye contact. He seemed to recognize me only somewhat, there was none of the warmth and friendship and camraderie we'd built over the years, scarcely even an acknowledgement that I too was a person, just a cold, calculating sort of violence. 

He seemed not to regard me as a threat. Turned away from me and carried on butchering the screaming mercenaries and the shrieking staff.

He took one hit--then another. Two rifle wounds at close range through his armor and his chest, I could see the blood spray. He didn't pause for a second. It was if he was on drugs--but then he took a bullet through the head and just kept fighting.

More gunfire--instinctively I ducked behind the wall, but it wasn't gunfire. It was a helicopter. A little black helicopter with a subdued striped flag on the side. A cold trickle of fear--then a deluge of adrenaline.

""Shit! The Americans!"" I yelled.

At once Ramzan turned away from the mercs and the mercs turned away from Ramzan. They began to fire at the helicopter--but it circled around and opened up with a machinegun, or a minigun, I don't fucking know, it just fired a lot of bullets and it fired them fast. There were men in the windows--American soldiers--and they fired their weapons too, wreaking havoc on the mercs and Ramzan both.

But Ramzan still stood. Ramzan still fought. A lone man with a lone gun, his chest and his limbs ripped apart by gunfire, but still he fought, a devil, a living nightmare. But as he took more gunfire, his arms were ruined--his hands were ruined--he could no longer aim. 

And so the helicopter seemed to abandon him. It made its way over the lab, directly above me, and began to descend.

That was when I realized that they hadn't seen me. And that I still had my weapon.

I aimed it skyward, at the belly of the beast. Held down the trigger, screaming, and didn't let go.

The pilot must have realized he was being shot at. He tried to peel off, but a fine stream of fluid began to leak from a bump in the back of the chopper. I reloaded--racked my weapon--fired again and then there was a wave of flame and heat and I knew no more.

---

I awoke to the stench of burning oil and burning flesh. Burning meat. That's what struck me about it the most. It was scarcely different from the rats my brother and I roasted over the fires in the woods. We were all just meat when we lived, carrion when we died.

A body was next to me. An American soldier. I had shot him--I must have. The bullet had entered under his chin and exploded within his helmet, shredding his face and skull from the inside out. Half of his clothing was burned away, leaving him almost naked in the scorching desert sun.

I rolled away. Puked. Then I reloaded my weapon, puked again, and tried to assess the scene.

Everyone was dead. The lab staff, the mercs, all of the Americans, Ramzan must have run off and perished in the desert. The helicopter itself had crashed into the sand, billowing black smoke. A charred, bleeding skeleton was still in the cockpit, still trying to pull up and get away.

Fucking scum. I spat and made my way to the stairs--movement. One of the bodies was moving. A dark hand reached for a pistol--I pounced on him and kicked it away. Then I rolled the scum to face me and leveled my weapon at his face.

It was the first time I'd seen one of the faces I'd been told to hate. An American--and worse, a black man. A man, I'd been told, who wasn't a man at all, but a half-human savage something who existed only to prey upon us. 

What struck me was how... normal he was. How peaceful. Yes, he looked a bit different, and yes, he was in theory an enemy soldier, but in that moment he was just a person. Just like me.

""What the Hell,"" I seethed, ""were you doing here?""

It was in Russian, I realized. There was no way he was going to understand it. I took a moment--tried to piece together words in English--but he responded in perfect Russian.

""The plant... the chemical weapons... had to shut it down.""

""Chemical weapons?"" I scoffed. ""Nonsense. Impossible.""

He just laughed. Coughed some blood and nodded his head.

""Then why didn't you level it with one of your cruise missiles?"" I asked. ""Or a fucking air strike? Why the Hell send people here?""

""Too risky,"" he mumbled. ""This isn't your grandfather's chemical weapons. This is new shit. Listen...""

Then he explained it to me. Then it made sense. Why we were so far from everything and everyone, why the poor, desperate Syrian state had put the money and effort into building a lab in the middle of nowhere. Why they had first attacked the lab with a cyber weapon--and only responded with a cobbled-together mission when they realized we were onto them. 

""It was our only choice,"" he said. ""The only thing we could do to stop it. And we had to stop it. This shit is too powerful. And in the hands of Al Assad..."" he shook his head.

""But we failed,"" he sighed. Laughed. ""Well,"" he nodded at my rifle, ""go on and do it, I guess. Just make it quick.""

He turned his head to the side. That was when I noticed something bizarre, something I hadn't seen or even thought of in years. A heavy machinegun patch, displayed rather prominently on the side of his helmet. 

""Hey,"" I said, ""is that from Metal Slug?""

The soldier blinked. Looked at me.

""Yeah, it is. Why?"" he asked. 

""It was my favorite game as kid,"" I said. ""I had... I don't even remember what number. It was the one that starts out on a beach... and then there were zombies...""

""And then you fight aliens,"" the American interjected. ""They come out of a meteor--God, those things scared the shit out of me as a kid--""

""Not me,"" I declared. ""I kicked their asses every time. And then at the end of the game, you go into a rocket and fight the aliens in their mothership!""

""I never got that far,"" the American said. ""See, we had the real arcade version at home. I guess I was a little too rough with it--it got to a point, my character wouldn't stop jump and would never actually shoot. Damn thing's still busted at my grandpa's house,"" he laughed.

""I had the same problem!"" I said. ""But it doesn't have to be the end of the game. All you need to do is clean the corrosion with some isopropyl, reconnect the traces and re-solder any busted pins--that's it.""

""I guess so, now that you're saying it,"" he laughed. ""Funny to think about it now, here of all places.""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Funny.""

""So,"" he nodded at my Kalashnikov, still aimed roughly in his direction, ""are you still going to do it?""

I shook my head no.

""Then what are you going to do?""

""Don't ask me that fucking question,"" I said. ""Or else I might change my mind. Now get up.""

I offered him a hand. He took it and struggled to his feet. I got an arm under his shoulder and together, we hobbled down the stairs, back to the plant, back to our final, desperate mission.

---

""There are three tanks,"" I said. ""If we divert all cryo into one, the chemical agents will overheat and die out in an hour, maybe two maximum.""

""What about the cryo?""

""That's the best part,"" I said. ""The tank we load it into will experience systemic cascading failure from overpressure and eventually rupture catastrophically.""

I saw his face. Too much jargon, too much Russian. So I switched to English.

""The fucking thing will explode!""

And he understood it. 

""We'll take out the generators for good measure,"" I said. I started to manipulate the manifolds and the series of manual control valves to divert the cryo as we'd agreed. When I was completed, I locked the controls in place and stepped back.

""Now the physical path is in place,"" I said. ""All we need to do now is open the valves digitally. Go ahead and execute subroutine 4c with data set [1,2,3,4].""

I paused. Realized that I didn't even know the fellow's name. So I turned--Ramzan. Ramzan on top of the soldier. Beating him, eating him with his bare hands. I shouted--and he looked at me with the same deadened, inhuman eyes that he had before.

He grinned. Licked his lips, his face, with that bizarre, overlarge tongue. 

""Hey..."" he paused. Searched his memory with a brain that was half blown out of his skull. Gave up when he realized that my name too was somewhere among the bits of bone and fat and blood in the desert.

""What were you saying we need to do?""

""I-I'll take care of it,"" I said. ""It's a little hard to explain. He was the expert--but it's okay, I can handle it.""

I tried to smile. Not sure if I succeeded. Made my way over to the laptop, to the bleeding body next to it, while trying to shy away from Ramzan, or the thing that Ramzan was. He seemed to notice and stood in a somewhat awkward manner. Like he had gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar, not with his hand in the ribcage of a human being.

""Why don't you go and check the tanks?"" I asked, nodding at the cryo tanks for emphasis. ""It's an important job. I need you to tell me--to make sure that it goes okay.""

He nodded, his tongue lolling out of his lips, covered in blood and worse. He made his way to the depths of the complex and began to look around, pretending to know what he was doing.

I began to type. Type anything, really, it was fucking hard with my hands shaking that much. Try to figure out something, a plan or something, before whatever was left of Ramzan broke and he came for me too. And then a hand grabbed at my wrist. I almost screamed--but it was the American. Still alive--barely--staring at me.

""When you load all the cryo into one tank,"" he said, ""what happens to the tanks giving up their fuel?""

""They lose pressure,"" I said. ""There's a helium tank to maintain pressure, and force the cryo to wherever its going.""

""And what happens to that helium tank?""

""What?""

""Is there another fucking tank that pressurizes it,"" he whispered, at the last of his strength, ""or does it lose pressure?""

""It does,"" I said. ""Almost to a vacuum.""

And then it dawned on me what he was getting at. 

""Hey, Ramzan,"" I called, and the Ramzan thing looked up from whatever it had been doing. ""Do you see the chamber off to the side, the one labelled 'He'?""

""Yes,"" he called.

""Go and look at that one. I think it's having a problem,"" I said. ""When I give you the word... turn the knob labelled 'for scope inspection',"" I said. ""There's a safety, you'll have to break it--""

There was a shriek of ripping metal.

""Broken!"" Ramzan called.

""Good,"" I said. ""Now, stand by...""

Subroutine 4c. Dataset [1,2,3,4]. I hit enter, heard the pumps turn on and a moment later the helium chamber open its valve.

""Okay, now!""

I looked up and watched. Ramzan turned the valve--tried to turn it--then shunted his body in front of the pipe labelled 
scope inspection. It was no wider than a few centimeters but when the helium tank lost pressure, when it got down to a vacuum, it gripped Ramzan. It gripped him and it grabbed him and it didn't let go.

He looked at me. Looked at us. And if there was a human part of him left, it felt nothing but fear--right before the difference in pressure grew even more--and sucked him in, limb by limb. I heard the wet sloshing impacts on the inside of the tank and knew that Ramzan, or whatever he had become, was gone--human, demon, or otherwise.

A grin from the ground. My friend--the American. His mission accomplished, he lay repose. Calm and peaceful with the success of his mission. His face was chalky pale and the last remnants of blood were dripping out of him. There was nothing I could do, he knew it and I knew it.

""Just tell me your name,"" I pleaded with him.

""Lieutenant Jackson, US Army--""

""Your first name, damn it!""

""Oh,"" he said. ""It's... Traven.""

""Traven,"" I said. ""Mission... complete."" I laughed through tears, realizing that I had just quoted my favorite, my Metal Slug.

I clasped hands with Traven. ""Tell me, so I can tell your superiors--who is your unit? Are you Delta Force?""

He blinked. Looked directly at me. And in the last moments of his life, with the last vestiges of his consciousness, he smiled, and said, ""Not Delta Force...

""Delta P.""

---

I did my part, I suppose. God, so many of us have done our parts over the years in this unspoken, uncertain fight against this unknown foe. Ukraine, Chechnya, Afghanistan, and before that, Nazi Germany. Now Syria... and now proof that this program, whatever it is, is still alive and well. 

All I can do now is hope and pray that the Americans have attacked them somehow by now. Maybe with a worm. Preferably with a fucking bomb.

As for me... I won't bore you with the details of how I got away, though I will admit that I enjoyed that stereotypical moment of walking away into the sunset, with a massive explosion behind me. Not too massive, of course--it was just the ruptured cryo tanks. The stuff they were cooling... that will have overheated and died out minutes later.

I don't think the Russians can find me where I am now, though I suspect the Americans can. I believe they'll leave me alone, for the most part, because I'm no threat to them. (Err, not anymore anyway, I promise! I'll leave your pretty industrial controls alone, please don't send me to Gitmo :&lt;)

If not... if they really need my help fighting this foe, they can find me. It's not that hard. I'm not hiding that well. I can't be. There aren't that many ethnic Poles with Russian passports with Syrian visa stamps. And certainly, there aren't that many of those who have ordered, through the magic of the internet, a Metal Slug arcade machine...

And isopropyl. And a multimeter. And a soldering iron. 

And this time, I'm going to fucking run and jump and shoot my heart out, and if the circuit corrodes and shorts, I'll fix it. And then I'm going to find all of the coins and all of the prisoners of war, and every last one of the heavy machineguns, and I'm going to play until my mission is complete, just as a certain US Army Delta P Lieutenant did before me.

Traven Jackson--this one's for you!"

I am deeply confused on the which career path I should choose.

My background: had data science internship experience, and full failure analysis engineer experience. I want to deal data thats more related to engineering while the traditional engineering role makes very bored at work.

Application Co-op needs me to provide a decision by Monday. And I have told the Data Engineer intern company about the situations and they seems to like me a lot and willing to push two round of interviews forward and will be having last one in this Monday if things goes smoothly.

For Application co-op, I think this path is more traditional, but it also requires coding and data science skill; relocation is needed.

 For the battery software start up, I think the potential is high but the risk is also high. Basically, I think been software will open a bigger career opportunity for me since Application engineer is limited to semiconductor industry.

I am here to hear about your take on about this. I am willing to take in any advises.

Thank you very much"
u0onew,1,2022-04-10,I dont even know what to do anymore,throwaway338x2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u0onew/i_dont_even_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Hey everyone. I'll try to keep this brief, apologies in advance. TLDR: broke-ish college student with family problems doesn't know where to live/what to do. I'm an 18 year old girl.

TW: discussion of abortion, suicide.

My dad is estranged and I've never met him. My mom raised me by herself. I was a """"""gifted"""""" child.I did well in school and got accepted into a government intern type program for college students. Very exciting and I got to move away from home. My home life has been tumultuous since about age 5 when my mother suddenly gained a temper. She would get very angry at me quite often and be very critical. She hit me a couple times and I would 'run away from home' often and spent the night at a 24h McDonalds or something. I didn't really live with her in grades 11-12, I lived at my godparents or my grandmas instead. My grandma broke her ribs at the beginning of my senior year and I had to transfer from my prestigious college prep school into a public school due to stress and depression from caring for her. My grandpa is also a functioning, but very bad, alcoholic who i have had limited contact with. 

Anyway. I went to this college program and did fine at work, but I guess due to being a goody-two shoes loner during high school I immediately lost my virginity and got pregnant (I was drunk and barely remember it but I know he took the condom off). I had a very early term medical abortion (2-3 weeks) but still feel quite bad about it. He pressured me into it and said he would move to Switzerland to avoid paying child support. I am pro-choice but I would never wish an abortion on anyone and I think they should be limited as much as possible. This put me in a depression and I decided that if I got pregnant again I would kill myself. 

I moved in with him when our dorm contracts ended in the spring. My mother told me to move in with him instead of signing a year lease with some friends. My boyfriend was quite cold and I did all the domestic work. Got depressed and attempted suicide after an incidence of work jealousy. Not premeditated. I was on prozac for years and but had skipped some doses and I just remember taking the whole bottle with some aspirin and a white claw. 

TLDR two days in kids hospital (i was still 17) with seizures. Mother flew out to take care of me and we went home. broke up with my boyfriend. 

I decided to go back to my college town but was working two jobs to pay for rent and couldn't handle it. Quit one and got fired from the other (actually filing a sexual harassment claim due to my boss). I've been back home since December. 

I now live at home with my mother and hate it. I don't know what to do. My therapist thinks she has some sort of cluster-B personality disorder and I agree. I feel so trapped. I've been riddled with depression for the past few months and I don't really see a light at the end of the tunnel. I applied to finish my undergrad (two years left) at my hometown university but I dont know if I can stomach two more years living with her. She's so constantly critical of everything: my boyfriend (I have a new one dont worry, hes very sweet), the way I dress, the way I do schoolwork, my room, etc. I have a bit of a ""depression room"" right now, but I feel awful about it and her rants doesn't make it any better. She'll literally wake up on a Sunday morning (today) and rant about me and my room for an hour. 

I have $2k in my bank account. Can't live with boyfriend since a) he lives with his parents and b) I don't want a repeat performance of last summer. Don't have any family here except for aforementioned grandparents. Don't have any friends. Don't want to go back to my college town because my ex-boyfriend has spread rumours about me to all of my former friends. 

Thank you for reading this. Any and all advice would be appreciated."

I had not yet committed to attend my school but I went to hear the talk and Q&amp;A with the students and alumni for computer engineering. I waited for everyone to leave and then started talking with one of the alumni who works at Google. He offered me an unpaid summer internship to basically work on a department related project with an opportunity to be referred to Google. 

I was homeschooled from 4th through 12th grade and starting college after that wasn’t easy. I didn’t follow through with the project I committed to do. Then, in fall, I was offered an officer position in the computer club that the alumni was affiliated with. I tried to follow through but I struggled to follow through because, as I was working, I always worried that I wasn’t doing good work so I wouldn’t share or commit my work at all. I ghosted them several times throughout the semester and kept trying to follow up but I failed each time. 

Having taken over a year of college classes during homeschooling in high school, I was doing sophomore level classes as a freshman in a pretty difficult major. I did not enjoy being homeschooled through high school and I guess I was still coming to terms with that during my time so far in college.

A couple months through my second semester, covid hit and I haven’t had anything to do with this club since. Most everyone I remember being there is gone. Google alumni is still there. 

Should I reconnect with this club? The club just opened their room for the first time in two years. How do I do it without it being terribly awkward?"
u0sg3p,1,2022-04-10,My coworker and friend did the green stuff in my friends' house. Now everyone is mad at them.,throwaway529019371,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u0sg3p/my_coworker_and_friend_did_the_green_stuff_in_my/,"Posting from a throwaway because my main is too recognizable. Also on mobile, sorry for any formating issues.

For some context and background, I'd like to start off this post by saying that I fully believe that the green stuff should be legalized in every state. I currently live in a state where it is very much not legal. I personally have never done it, because its not for me and the smell alone has gives me major migraines (I have a lot of allergy issues which could be causing this, but we aren't sure). Either way, I'm fine with other people using it... just please not around me.

On to the problem at hand. I'm (21F) currently on a year long internship in the middle of being in my undergrad degree. I introduced one of my coworkers (19F, who we'll call Sarah) from this internship to one of my boyfriend (20M, who we'll call Jake) 's roommates (20M, who we'll call Victor). They have three other roommates, all 21M, who we'll call Tim, Bill, and Bob. Victor and Sarah hit it off and started being friends with benenfits. 

Last night, Sarah had decided to drive down to my university to spend the night with Victor at the boys' house. Everything was great for a Saturday night, Victor and Sarah were doing their own thing while the rest of us watched a movie. The whole house started to reak of the green stuff. It clearly wasn't very good stuff, since we could all smell it all the way downstairs. Bob, Tim, Bill, and Jake all ran upstairs and knocked on Victor's door, asking them to stop immediately since the smell was so bad. We opened all of the windows in the house immediately, on a 40F night, and the smell didn't go away until the next morning. 

About 20 minutes later, Victor came down and argued with us, saying we were all just being babies and that they weren't even smoking that much. The rest of the guys fired back, and yelled at him that if he was going to do that in the house he should have asked first, or should have gone outside. 

Like I stated previously,  the green stuff is illegal in the state we're in. While Tim, Bill, Bob, Jake, and I all have no issue with people using it, we're all worried about how it could potentially affect us. All of us have jobs with contracts that specify no drug usage. For Jake specifically this is a huge issue, given he has a government clearance for his job and if police were to find the stuff in his house then he could potentially lose his job. Very unlikely since he wasn't using it, but still. Sarah also knew from previous conversations that I have massive issues with the smell, and I literally had to go walk around outside for an hour so that I didn't get too light headed. I woke up the next morning with a big headache, since we could still smell it.

Needless to say, everyone is now pissed at Victor and Sarah. I'm letting Jake, Tim, Bob, and Bill handle Victor, since obviously he is their roommate. However, I have to deal with Sarah at work, and this is where I need advice. She has talked about me behind my back before, shit talked Victor, Jake, Tim, Bob, and Bill to my face, and I know I'm going to get and earful about how my boyfriend is such a party pooper and lame person for telling them to stop. The other interns will probably join in on it too, since I'm pretty introverted and they all find me weird since I don't drink with them on weeknights. I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with Sarah and Victor, because honestly at this point I'm still pissed at the whole situation. 

Tl,dr: Friends did the illegal green stuff in the house. Now everyone is mad at them. How do we move forward?"

u0tu4s,1,2022-04-10,High School Freshman wondering what to do,Avocado____Toast,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/u0tu4s/high_school_freshman_wondering_what_to_do/,"Background:  
I am a Freshman with a decent amount of beginner programming info seeking a career in computer science/software development. I am currently almost done with AP Computer Science A and am near the top of my class, and I scored a 5 on the mock AP.

&amp;#x200B;

Goals: 

\-Mainly building a strong college resume, fit with a portfolio and general knowledge of multiple languages

\-Starting a programming based club in my school to have a leadership role involving programming (but of course first I would need to be qualified)

\- Exploring all kinds of branches of programming like web development, mobile and desktop app development, maybe even game development, etc... to find which interests me the most and could be a potential career

\- Being able to possibly get internships in college

&amp;#x200B;

Courses/Languages I'm looking at:

\-The Odin Project seems like a good way to both learn many aspects of web development and make projects and build a portfolio with it, so it seems like a strong contender

\-CS50 seems like a far better general computer science class than APCSA that seems to be recommended by the sub so it is also a possibility

\-I want to find some C# Course for both desktop app development and maybe even explore game development with Unity and build a portfolio with them

\-I am slightly iffy on mobile app development for right now as I do not have a Mac for writing Swift and a whole android app course seems very isolated from everything else

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to try and start over summer break after APs are over and continue from there, but my main questions are these:

 \-Are the courses/languages I gave good for achieving the goals I outlined?

 \-What is a realistic schedule or order of doing the course (Ex. CS50 over summer, halfway through that start Odin, etc...)? Are the courses I gave 

Any general advice is also much appreciated because I have no idea if anything I outlined is really viable."

u0uwdc,14,2022-04-10,Should I decline my first job offer?,InternationalDig5738,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u0uwdc/should_i_decline_my_first_job_offer/,"I’m a new grad from a data analytics boot camp, and I’m looking to start a full time job as I do part time college. I have a decent bit of experience with python development prior to this and feel comfortable making small programs and working in teams. 

I just started applying to entry level positions for data analysis and python development and within the first few applications I was offered a position but the pay is very underwhelming… about 40,000 for a remote full time position as an intern. I understand it’s just an internship and don’t exactly know how much that changes. 

Context aside, I honestly don’t know if I should accept this position. I believe my skills are decent for entry level and this offer was given within my first 10 applications sent. I thought I may be able to start closer to 50-60,000 based on what I’ve been reading online in my area (remote or in person I don’t care) but I have also been hearing about the horror stories of people applying to hundreds of positions even though they have a degree, and possibly even experience. 

I’m not in dire need of starting a job now, I have a few months budget before anything will become an issue regarding that. My biggest concern is that I’ll turn this offer down with high hopes but then will fail to find another offer. 

To go along with that I don’t want to get into a position where I am getting underpaid for my skill and work ethic."

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

u0wgts,2,2022-04-10,"If a I am new to the workforce, what do I tell employers about taking 5 yrs to graduate?",Pomodoroman,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u0wgts/if_a_i_am_new_to_the_workforce_what_do_i_tell/,"I recently had an interview with a company for an internship for the summer and despite the interview going well I didn’t get the job. One of the reasons why I think I did not was because in my college experience I never held a job or extracurriculars because with my mental health and anxiety issues it was hard enough alone for me to try to get A’s and B’s.  Two times I did fail a course but overall still had a decent GPA 3.4 from a top 20 public university which made me a candidate for this competitive internship.  I do believe that they picked someone who seemed to have more work experience with clubs and fraternities etc….

I am going to take five full years to graduate now that I have to take a summer off for the first time because I am incredibly burnt out from living back home in the middle of nowhere doing college for a year during covid and then making up classes due to being a transfer student who previously went to a college that limited the amount of classes I could take.  It’s many reasons.  I just told the interviewer that I was burned out from taking four classes in a summer as the reason why I didn’t hold down a job in addition to going to college.  I also told them that I saved up money from working jobs and side hustles in high school so that I didn’t have to worry about money as much in college.  None of these are lies I just still don’t like the situation they are putting me in bc the students around me do not have similar issues from what I’ve seen.  

Going forward applying for jobs I don’t know what I will tell my interviewers on why I took so long to graduate. I don’t think it is a good idea to tell them that its because I had to limit the amount of classes I was taking a take a summer off for a mental health break.  During this mental health break, I do plan to get a job however to be able to say I at least did something else in college.  I know everyone on here and my friends will say it’s OK that I had to take measures to care for my mental health, and it is.  However, I am afraid that employers will see this as laziness or weakness.  I have gotten over the majority of my mental health issues and don’t believe I am any of those things however we live in a society where that is the norm to think that of someone unfortunately.  What should I say about this going forward to an interviewer?"

I'm just kinda lost right now.  I have just a few classes left before I can graduate, but I just can't get myself to do any of the work or even go to class.  I'm so tired of school and I just wanna graduate already. 

I don't wanna fail/withdraw from another class, but it's looking like that will be the case with one of my classes this semester. 

My GPA is kinda low, but I'm starting my second internship this summer so I'm not too worried about it.

I've just been slowly getting more and more burnt out every semester, and I'm not sure what I can do to get myself out of this hole.  

Any tips or words of encouragement would be fantastic.

Thanks

I’ll be 18 in september. And while my parents say they aren’t going to just kick me out onto the street I’m just…I want to get out of here by two years after graduation if at all possible, if they even let me. I’m trying to budget money (working two jobs, usually around $300 which isn’t enough but I do not want to keep quitting and starting new jobs as that won’t look too good). But my main problem is…figuring out what the hell I’m going to do after school. I’ve expressed that college isn’t for me (ADHD, BPD, etc makes it hell) and I know I’ll have shit luck there, besides, nothing I could study in college is anything I’m interested in or that would pay well enough. The only thing I’m halfway into and sort of planning on at this point is either going to trade school or getting an apprenticeship to be a plumber. I think the job stability, the declining number of plumbers currently, and other littler things like lower math involvement and lifting requirements and that you’re doing different things each day are appealing.

My father took it okay enough when I talked to the family about it, but now he’s passive-aggressive about the entire thing. I tried to tell him about possible internships my school was helping me find and he blew me off. I asked him roughly how much rent I would need where we live and he was like “____, that’s why you’re going to school.” My father and I have always butted heads and while I won’t get into that here, he is abusive and one of the main reasons I have set a two year limit on staying if allowed. (That and I can’t wait to start out on my own.) 

My mother is hesitant, but at the end of the day just wants me to find a job and succeed in what I do. 

Which brings me to tonight. When I asked him about the rent. After he said that, I just left to my room. (I would have stayed and stood my ground but I had a lot of stress that day and couldn’t deal with him.) But I heard them talking about me. He said “she’s going to fucking college” and my mother said “we aren’t going to decide her future for her.” 

I just don’t know what to do. Am I wrong to not go to college? I do not want to waste money on something futile. But he doesn’t think I have the mental or physical strength to be a plumber (mental health and because I’m a girl although I’ve recently gotten into fitness and want to start lifting eventually.) I understand that neither of my siblings before have gone to college and that might be a big reason why, but I honestly feel so hopeless and it’s sending me through depressive episodes. I know I’ll face harassment: I do every day. I know I’ll have to stick with it and prove myself. But I also know that the idea of college-especially as I don’t know what I would go for-is terrifying. 

Please, is there any advice at all? For my future, for dealing with parents?"

a little background on myself, I started my journey into programming because I wanted to learn how to fix problems or bad design in programs and applications I use. I enrolled in Harvard’s CS50 class, as well as Microsoft’s Learn courses for C#. I found it difficult to learn, as well as stay motivated and slowly stopped doing course work. After some months I enrolled in LCCC to learn the basics of programming, and better my skills in Math, and English. With a strong foundation of programming, after graduation I’d re-enroll into Microsoft’s Learn courses and, utilize other free resources till I am to build programs of my own design. I have to two ideas for my own programs, and I’d like to build a company based of those programs. Before that I would like to earn a few years of experience in the field programming for a company.

For data-wrangling, where the file has 100,000+ rows would using the python library pandas be a good approach? There are also some special symbols like æ¥­ãƒžãƒƒãƒ in the file. I think this is from when a symbol doesn't get loaded properly? How would I go about fixing this?

I'll be starting my internship as a Software Engineer in a Big N in one month and I start to feel as a very big impostor. I know it's pretty common but let me add some context.  
I went to a prestigious engineering school in France. However, here the schools are really generalist and it is only in the last year that we specialise. I specialized in Data Science, so I have some basic knowledges in computer science, but that's all. Before my interview, I worked on Leetcode as I was told, and that's it. I was sure that the interviewers would realise that I wasn't competent enough so I didn't think I would get the internship. However the interview was surprisingly easy. 

I'm really happy to do this internship because I really want to learn. However, I'm afraid I don't know any of the basics that everyone learns at school, and I'll look stupid.

Do you think that with enough work,  everything can be learned through experience?"

I am an intern at a firm and fairly new to IT in overall and i hear a lot of people saying in this community that PowerShell is a must have skill to have. I use PowerShell sometimes to get some exports or use other commands i find with google. I know a little how to use it and i can google my answer to a problem. Now i am intrigued to take it a step farther and actually learn PowerShell and not just copy paste commands i find from google. Is it worth it? Do you guys use PowerShell a lot or is it a waste of my time?

u1601v,27,2022-04-11,ASUCI 2022-23 Presidential Election,zootzotzap,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/u1601v/asuci_202223_presidential_election/,"I don’t know if you all know, but there is a [general election](https://www.elections.uci.edu/) happening this week (Monday 4/11 @9am-Friday 4/15 @5pm) for ASUCI where you will able to vote who will be your next student president, vice presidents, school based senators, special interest senators, and student advocate general. While you should get informed for all those running to represent you, I am mainly going to be focusing on the presidential candidates. With that being established, there was a [debate](https://fb.watch/ch6v2HtwHe/) that occurred last week for the presidential candidates. With the presidential position having many controversies in recent times, I thought I would put my opinion out there as a person who’s invested in ASUCI and wants you to make a more informed choice. 

First, I would like to highlight some of the roles of the president are. You can look [here](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci_constitution_final.pdf#page11) to see what the role is in the ASUCI Constitution, but I’m going to explain it on a more day-to-day role from my understanding. The ASUCI president acts as the official representative of the undergraduate student body. They have the ability to meet with administration, particularly the chancellor, on a regular basis. (I believe monthly) This carries lot of weight and responsibility because you are representing over 30k students to these highly powerful individuals at our institution. It also requires a careful balance in that you want to push the administration to take actions that will support student needs without pissing them off, to put frankly. These people just don’t have enough time to hear out every single concern and will often do the bare minimum to say that they “consulted” student government before moving forward. However, if we can build a mutual relationship with them, this gives us the leverage to take on bigger things without having to walk on eggshells.  Besides meeting with the administration, they also sit on very important meetings, such as PSAC, that influence things that very much affect student life through things such as budget, policy, and efforts. This is where I personally see a lot more change happening since this administration end up having to delegate these departments to undertake the students’ requests. The president also represents us to the other UCs and the regents, and I assume that the conversations would be similar to those with admin.


Internally, the president sets the commissions within their office, hires those leading the commissions, and leads the executive cabinet meetings. Commissions are generally addressing the pressing and changing needs of the student body. They are the ones who will plan the events that you see such as exhibitions, speakers, info sessions, etc as well as work with resource centers and departments for programming and possible policy changes. This requires the president to create a strong team that is also well versed in the bureaucratic barriers. If the president themself are not familiarized with school policies, it really sets their team back. Each commission has it’s own intricacies since they do address different facets of student needs, but if they cannot go to the president for tools to navigate internal policies or know where to look for information, they essentially are trying to incite change blindly. I firmly believe that everyone who is hired should be passionate about the commission, student advocacy (+ familiarity with campus depts), and have the time and energy to commit to their role. While previous experience in student government greatly helps, there are many roles that people can step into without extensive experience in ASUCI WITH the right training and mindset. This means that the president needs to know what goals they are setting forth for these commissions and that the people they hire are on board and know what they are getting themselves into. Setting up new commissions has its own pros and cons, mainly that they require much more resources to get set up since they have nothing but a vision to work off of. If this is a commission with redundancy within ASUCI, their responsibilities have to be differentiated so we get the full breadth of student needs. However, its a way for the president to address a different need for students that may come up year to year that other commissions otherwise wouldn’t be able to. Overall, the president needs to be knowledgeable on campus needs and policies. 

So, what should you look for in a presidential candidate? First and foremost, someone who can set realistic goals. While it is good to have ambition and come in with a vision, you are working within an institution with systemic barriers that cannot be dismantled with just this presidency. They have to know what are problems that need to be addressed immediately, concerns that can be easily solved, and what are long term goals that may span past this school year so that their energy can go into efforts strategically. Secondly, they need to be communicative to the students, their team, and administration. Students just don’t have the energy to keep up with all the happenings in ASUCI, and ASUCI needs to be able to address students’ concerns. ASUCI has had a history of poor accessibility and transparency, and I think that strengthening our media presence and utilizing word of mouth is the only way to effectively address them. A strong and cohesive team also needs to exist so that efforts are collective and comprehensive. With ASUCI containing over 500 members, it can be difficult to ensure that we are unified and on the same page. If we aren’t, there will be gaps in knowledge between individuals/offices, which may slow the progress on change. Lastly, administration can be very particular when it comes to how and which student concerns are addressed. The president needs to when to pressure administration and what needs to be pushed. Otherwise, we as students come off as petty or entitled when we push trivial changes or in a manner that they don’t like.


MY takes on each candidate:

Hugh Young (Jira Trinketkamol)
	I think Hugh has aspirational ideas and is very charismatic. However, I know that he has burned many bridges within ASUCI with the way that he’s worked and talked with people. His intention to run for president for this upcoming school year has been apparent ever since the beginning of this academic year. While it is admirable to be ambitious and have the forethought to run, his motives were never clear. Many of the ideas he set forth are already things being worked on by OTHER PEOPLE and not himself, which is part of the reason why people feel used by him. I think if he were to become president, he would have work on repairing the relationships within ASUCI since many of these people are likely to return to ASUCI. In addition to that, I think he has to have a clearer plan on how he wants to achieve these goals that he’s set. As I have mentioned earlier, there are many bureaucratic barriers that I don’t think he’s accounted for with his plans and ideas. With his experience within ASUCI as both the international senator and intern, I would think that he would outline more details on that since it is vital to make change happen. At best, there will be performative actions, and at worst, there will just be a more divided ASUCI that will lead to further student distrust in ASUCI if he doesn’t address these concerns.

Sarah Seeman
	Sarah is a passionate person from what I’ve seen from her. Many of the goals she’s set are towards working with resource centers, such as the Fresh Hub, to address the needs of students. I know that she’s also mentioned getting more student input and interaction into the policy changes that will be pursued, which I think will be a good start on rebuilding trust between ASUCI and the student body since it gives students a chance to get involved with ASUCI without a position in it. She also acknowledges some of the institutional barriers that prevent her from achieving her full vision. From her work as a senator these last 2 years, she should know the inner workings of ASUCI, so I hope that will not be a barrier for her. She seems to have incorporated that previous knowledge into the goals that she’s set with trying to increase communication across offices. I do think that she seems soft spoken in the debates, which I don’t know how that will influence things when it comes to speaking with administration on theses important topics. However, I think she mentions having a cold, so I don’t know if that changes anything. I see that, overall, she wants to focus on strengthening the work that ASUCI does in each commission and promoting collaboration within the campus. 

Michael Malinski 
	From watching the debates, Malinski seems to have a lot of knowledge on campus happenings. I think that his knowledge despite not being in student government is commendable and would come handy if he were elected. It really shows that he is willing to take initiative to learn about what student concerns are and how they’re being addressed. However, I do have concerns again with his ability to lead with the lack of knowledge on UCI bureaucracy. He would be fighting an uphill battle trying to learn the ropes of the internal administration of ASUCI while trying to create change with policies. He would probably have to lean on hiring people that already have that knowledge since these are things that you usually learn with experience. I do think that his goals of making resources and ASUCI information more accessible is doable since these are things that can be worked on. His want to also uplift certain commissions is something he addressed both in the statement and the debate, so I hope he has a plan for that. It looks like to me that he wants to build transparency within ASUCI to students and to connect students to resources. Overall, Malinski seems well intentioned but may be set back with his lack of ASUCI experience. 

Paul Elias 
	I cannot really comment on this candidate because I cannot find any more information on this Paul than what is provided on the elections website. 

I apologize if my thoughts aren’t 100% organized as I am writing this in the early AMs. I want to remind everyone that am a singular individual giving out MY opinions and that they don’t necessarily reflect anyone else’s. Please take the time to read each [candidate’s campaign statements](https://www.elections.uci.edu/asuci/)/[the constitution](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci_constitution_final.pdf#page11), watch the [debate](https://fb.watch/ch6v2HtwHe/), and to do some research so that you can form your own opinion on what you want out of a president and how these candidates encapsulate it. I also want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, and PLEASE [vote](https://www.elections.uci.edu/) in the elections. Your voice matters, so make sure you’re choosing the candidate that you want to represent you. Even if you don’t vote for every position, your vote counts towards the count needed to pass some other important referendums. I also encourage you to get involved in ASUCI if you want to be directly involved with advocating for students. Thanks for reading until the end again :)

Later at the evening, i got kicked from our intern communication app and our shift planning app without any notice. Not even fucking told me i was kicked. Just kicked me so i couldnt share how bullshit they are with the other employees.
I got an email at 10pm asking me to be there for a ""discussion"" at the next morning. Well how about asking me less than a few hours before when people may sleep already?

I just got an email next day (after spamming them) that i will get my resignation per letter. 1 week later i still dont have it. I cant work nor can i sign a new contract because i dont have a fucking date of resignation yet. And since they could delete all evidence that ive worked for them, lets just hope that they just pay me my fucking sallary for the past month. Idk even if i could do something if they decide not to, except for burning their whole store down.

The next morning i woke up again with a sexy DM in my insta. Apparently, i wasnt the only one being fired.

They also deleted our non insulting, honest (but obviously negative) comments on Instagram and blocked our accounts. Very mature as a company. Very professional.

I'm currently working as an IT Support Engineer and i'm coming up to nearly a years experience in it now. It was the first role I landed after graduating with an honours degree in computer science. I was under the impression that I likely needed a years experience in IT Support before getting a role more defined in my degree seeing as my course didn't have placement, and ive never done an internship or anything like that so i've never had any experience in the IT field up until now. I'm wondering has me staying at that role for a year actually done me more of a disservice than anything now if I try to get a junior role of some sorts for example? I've been applying away for a new job recently but I have not been successful so far, is this a bad time for looking to land a new role? How is the job market at the minute? I'd prefer to get WFH job if possible as I'm not really looking to relocate in Ireland atm as im from the North and there doesnt seem to be anything locally close to me after searching. Should my CV still be one page after a years experience in IT Support or should I try to make it a two page one? Any tips for searching or when applying?"
u196gx,1,2022-04-11,Should I ask the company I'm interning at to NOT give me a full-time offer?,Where_Banana_9,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u196gx/should_i_ask_the_company_im_interning_at_to_not/,"I am currently an intern with an American MNC (Jan-Jun). I got the internship through an on-campus  offer and it's based on Risk/Data Analysis.
I wanted to explore the different career paths my field (Computer Science and Engineering) has to offer. This company was the first one to visit my college and luckily I was amongst the selects. The test was coding-based and so were the interviews (but not the mainstream Data Structures and Algorithms based).

My work revolves around Big Data (Hive) and Automation using Python. While I enjoy the work I'm doing here, and the generous stipend, I was hit with a not-so-pleasant surprise recently. Turns out that if I get a Pre-placement offer from my current firm, I won't be eligible to apply for any other firm that visits my college for placements in the final year (I'm currently in my pre-final year).
I have two issues with my current role:
Throughout my 3 years of my 4-year degree, I have been involved in purely development based work, working with tools like Web Dev and Machine Learning. Now, I've been put into the shoes of an Analyst, where I have to gather requirements, ideate, code, test of the automation required. I also have an Analysis aspect to my internship. I feel that the skills I gained in the field of development are not being put to use here to the fullest and that I'd do much better if I were an Software Development Engineer.
The second thing is the full-time compensation. It is relatively low, compared to the other same-tier companies that visits my campus.

To be able to apply to other SDE roles on-campus, I need to NOT get a PPO from my current firm, and given the current response of my manager, I think I might get it. 

Should I talk to them about this situation and convince them to not give me an offer (if they plan to)? How do I do that and would that be a bit offensive (given that interns are kind-of an investment for the company)?"

Is this normal? When accepting the offer, I negotiated the pay and gave them my start date, and my future supervisor said that they would send it over to HR. I reached out to HR for an unrelated question a few weeks ago, and they said they were excited to have me there this summer. It is a fairly large company where other students from my school have interned. I have heard of other interns signing contracts after accepting their offer, which is why I am curious if this is normal. I’m probably just overthinking now, but the company had some layoffs so I am nervous that my internship could possibly get cancelled since I haven’t signed anything. This is a marketing internship, so maybe signing is more common for engineering/com sci roles?"

u1b9od,2,2022-04-11,Finding a job in electrical engineering after college,Expensive-Bluejay-14,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/u1b9od/finding_a_job_in_electrical_engineering_after/,"I am currently a junior at auburn university studying electrical engineering and am about to enter my senior year of college essentially having 2 semesters left with the potential of taking 1 summer class in 2023 so graduation would be august 2023. 

My GPA is not the best currently sitting at around a 3.1-3.2 and possibly will drop a little more after this spring semester. Most of my college has been online due to covid and I feel as if I haven’t learned much. I also didn’t really figure out how to study until I say this semester because online school is way different when it comes to how you approach school. The only thing that I truly enjoy in school are my labs and building circuits. The math that comes with the circuits makes sense to me as well and those classes I do good in. When it comes to classes such as Electromagnetics, and signals and systems etc. I have trouble wrapping my head around the math that comes with them and don’t do the best. I’m honesty not much of a school person and would much rather learn on the job using my hands since I am a “hands on” learner. 

My question is how much would my GPA dropping below a 3.0 affect me finding a job after college. I’ve started to do some research of jobs after college just looking ahead and most of the places I look at require a 3.0 to apply or even be looked at. I have a great internship this summer working hands on in an electrical design/test setting and also have worked 3 years as a quality assurance engineer with the development of computer simulations and VR. This will be my first summer working an electrical engineering internship since my one before hand was computer engineering focused because that was my major before I switched but covid happened which made it hard to find companies hiring so I stayed with that group even though it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I also have a clearance which I am told is a plus when applying to places. 

Yeah so if anyone has any advice or if there is anything I should do to strengthen my chances of getting a job please let me know I’d love any type of knowledge I can get."

I love modeling and designing things. Recently learned of a CAD degree my school offers. My heart wants to abandon two-three quarters of credits and jump but idk if it’s the right move.

From people I’ve talked to you don’t need a degree for CAD or IT fields but the college basically fast tracks you into local industry, internships, and then a job.

Thinking I might get a BA next, so I guess what I’m asking is: if I end up trying for a material design career (or who knows, maybe UX or communications, I’m always scattered) which AA and early career experience sounds more valuable?"

I have a very impressive Freshman student in my intro to programming class.  He was clearly very advanced and wanted to expand what he had learned on his own, which was mostly Javascript.  Without realizing just how advanced the module was, I gave him a choice of what to learn and work on from Odin Project.  He chose Node.js and has been making excellent progress.  I noticed he also uses Arch Linux, which is just reaffirms that programming must be a real passion for him.

**I'm not sure what to advise him to do next**.   It seems like a basic AP class or college class would be really boring for him after Odin Project.  Maybe if the curriculum was flexible for him like mine is. I think that a **nurturing internship or summer experience with peers would be best.**  But most of these seem geared toward Seniors in high school.  I will definitely suggest both Free Code Camp, his own projects, and projects he wants to contribute to.  But I'd like to see him do other formalized structures that can build off of that enthusiasm.

""Well you're fresh out of school so there's no way we won't be able to compensate you"".

Some info: No internship experience relevant to CpE, just IT. Have done projects on my own with things such as STM chips, developed the PCBs, etc. Lead my team for my senior thesis for a big project doing embedded stuff, pcb dev, rasp pi, etc. Also created android/ios apps for each project.

That's it. Is the 90+ realistic? Also, how am I supposed to have an idea in mind when they don't share the benefits right away? I've only had one place do that so far, but in the end they couldn't pay me an NYC salary (was a remote role, HQ was located somewhere else, that's what they told me, so I turned it down). One place this past week said they can't share benefits until AFTER I'm hired. ???. So I told them I wouldn't be continuing with the process.

Thanks.

I've been at my current job Part time for a year and a month now, it's for a bank but I do not plan on foing banking long term. I'm currently getting my associates in Studio Art and will start working towards my Bachelors in the fall. This internship was sent to me by one of my Teachers and is really amazing because it requires absolutely no previous experience other than being a student and interested in Art.

I'm already in the process of turning in my application but my problem is my job. I would have to take a leave for 8 weeks as it is a full time position. My job does have LOA but I don't qualify for any of them (they even state i could take a Personal Leave but it states I can't take an internship). My manager is really understanding but I don't know how understanding she'll be if I ask for pretty much the majority of the summer off. It would mean we may be understaffed while I'm gone.

The biggest downside is that I'm also currently renting an apartment with my boyfriend. The internship pay more than my current job but it's only for 8 weeks. After that I would need to have a job to sustain renting and going to school, so If I decide to go for it I would either have to hope my boss lets me come back or be ready to find a new job that pays at least 18.25 or so.

TL;DR I really want to take an internship in my field of study but I'm not sure if I would be able to hold onto my current job. Do I risk it by taking an internship or play it safe and just work part time for the summer and keep job security."

So, could could we get one of:

* College questions get locked and mod noted that they should be posting to another sub instead
* Rules, flag criteria, and wiki get updated to reflect that college choice questions *are* acceptable so that those who *do* flag these questions will know that they are and stop flagging them (and likely continue the slow migration away from a sub filled with college students asking questions of other college students).

If the first option isn't feasible because of a lack of active mod staff, then that is a different issue that *should* be resolved by cleaning up the mod staff list rather than adjusting the rules to fit available moderation."

So I'm a new grad with like 3 months of full time experience, and 6 months of internship experience.

Right now one of my projects at work is to build a web application. What I noticed, was there was minimal senior developer guidance, and the team is mostly juniors for this project. I'm splitting time between this project and another.

But I've noticed that this particular project was using good practices (not that I'm one to comment with my experience hahah), but I've been giving some input to improve certain aspects of it. I've noticed that our logging isn't great, it's pretty inconsistent as there's no standard and different devs  logging via different ways.

I was talking to one of the more experienced devs on the team and we were discussing revamping how we use logging for this application. So I kinda took it on to myself to redesign the logging system we use. Given that I have no experience in this I spent a few hours researching and reading from docs to various Companies Engineering blogs to see what best practice would entail and how I could incorporate that advice into our project.

I realized that this ended up taking way more time than I anticipated (research, design, and implementation).

Then the question in my head popped up: Am I better off implementing a basic design that would just work and be faster or should I implement the solution following best practice recommendation?

I was wondering if some of the more experienced developers and leads can provide some input,

Here is the 117th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

u1fxuu,1,2022-04-11,"One month until CS Bachelors, going right back for BS In Software Engineering",SelfLos,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/u1fxuu/one_month_until_cs_bachelors_going_right_back_for/,"Hi guys,

So I will be graduating with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from a very small liberal arts school in the midwest, located in a suburb of Chicago with a GPA of a 2.8. Throughout my attendance I was not able to acquire any internship experience (big mistake). I am currently 24, and it will have taken me 6 years upon graduation next month to obtain this degree. Yeah I know what you’re thinking, no internship experience AND had multiple years at a chance to obtain one. 

For starters, I have been a full-time athlete and student competing for each school I attended and was really what enabled me to pursue a college education via scholarships and opportunities. The school I will be graduating from is my 3rd school after having spent time at a 4-year STEM school for two years where I took mostly general education requirements along with a few intro courses to my major, which was Mechanical Engineering at the time. As well as a community college for a year where I took general education courses for general engineering. Then 3 years at the school that I am currently at now where I switched majors to computer science. Throughout my years, I was primarily focused on my respective sport and all the other things that do not have to do with an internship and gaining skills in my career path. Lol. Like video games, and hanging out with friends. About 6 months ago is when I would say that I started to really take my career path serious (you know, after figuring out I need a job to live) and started to self-teach and supplement my university learning. CS is a huge world with a wide array of topics and subjects, and I have learned that more so this past year. I’ve been taking on personal projects, doing leetcode, learning popular industry tools/technologies, taking online courses, and overall trying to immerse myself into the CS world as well as fill a lot of knowledge gaps. I’m very interested in software engineering and development, and want to have a fulfilled career in it. I want to understand what is going on and develop myself in my respective field, and not just mindlessly complete work assignments. 

Fast forward to today and I am still self-teaching and will be graduating this coming month. Since November-December I have filled out about 550 applications for software/developer roles along with very few QA, IT and DevOps roles. Primarily entry-level roles. The job search has been excruciating, and cannot seem to land a position although I have gotten quite a bit of interviews. Resume does not seem to be an issue at least. The problem is I have not been able to do well on the technical interviews, which is why I am trying to hone in on my data structures and algorithms more. I really wish I would have gotten an internship and been more diligent in working on my skills during the past years. Also do not like my GPA and would later want to pursue a post-grad degree at a decent school years down the line. I am able to pursue an online bachelors in Software Engineering from Arizona State University for free starting this summer or fall, and am seriously thinking about doing that to maybe open the choice for me to get internships this summer (I know its late), or maybe the following semesters or summers. Maybe one of those would lead to a full-time job or at the very least some sort of experience. I don’t mind it, and am trying to learn anyways so it could help fill knowledge gaps. Also GPA would most likely be better as I am better at studying and time management making it easier to apply to grad school later on. Is this a good decision? I’ve thought about a masters in computer science, but that seems to be very theoretical and getting more specialized and an extension of a BS in CS. I don’t feel my foundation is good as of right now, and wouldn’t be able to get into any good grad schools with such a low GPA. Would rather think about grad school more farther down the line after working in the industry and filling in knowledge gaps. So does this sound like a sound decision, and is this a step backwards? I already have a BS in CS, almost. I do really see this as a long-term career, specifically software engineering and this sounds like it would help. I would be trying to get industry experience regardless if I do it, as it is an online degree. This would just mean I could get internships, correct? Would I even list my first degree when applying to internships since it could be seen as having too much experience? Is this essentially cheating the system in a way? Couldn’t I theoretically get back-to-back-to-back internships spanning a year? Then maybe get a full-time job after or anytime during?

TLDR;

Getting bachelors of science in Computer Science. No internships, sub 3 gpa, and knowledge gaps. Able to pursue free online BS in SE from ASU. Should I pursue since free and have second chance at getting internships that could lead to full-time?"

UMD:

pros -

Free

College park scholars

Higher ranked CS program

More attention for my major (funding, career fairs)

&amp;#x200B;

cons -

Would have to commute almost an hour, fear it may be a burden socially

A large program means large class sizes and potentially harder to select preferred courses

&amp;#x200B;

UVA:pros-

Only 2k a year

Better social scene/college experience

Would get to live on campus

Smaller program, better connections

&amp;#x200B;

cons-  
worried that my aid package might change and stick me with a lot more $ to pay

potentially may have to work a job as I am funding college on my own

Lower ranked cs program

Less recognition for its CS program, maybe less attention from big tech'

u1hklo,1,2022-04-11,Unsure whether to continue education or get a job,TheRealzToost,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u1hklo/unsure_whether_to_continue_education_or_get_a_job/,"So I am a graduating this May with a B.S. in C.S.. i have partaken in the accelerated masters program meaning I have 9 credits toward a masters degree should I wish to go to grad school leaving me with only 24 credits to go which I can do in a additional year. If I do so, I will get a M.S. in C.S.. 

Currently I work as a research assistant for the department which pardons the cost of my entire masters degree if I continue to work there throughout my grad degree. Currently, I have no real world work experience which i know is invaluable. I want to go work in the field when all is said and done and be a software engineer. 

So now to my question, I have been offered an internship with a local company who is known to give jobs after the internship period quite frequently. I have also been offered the position with the school that pays for my masters degree as i have mentioned. I have asked many professors for opinions and they are rather split on whether i should go through with the masters degree or just go straight to working in the field and then come back later if i wish. The professors who said I’d be better off not getting one said that unless i plan on moving toward academia, it isn’t worth it plus the year i spend in school would put me at a disadvantage compared to other applicants who may have been working since obtaining their bachelors. They have said companies don’t care to much about grad degree’s and that although you can make more starting, it isn’t enough to justify getting one due to the time lost and that ultimately companies don’t really care about masters. It’s just a resume eye candy for the most part. They have also said i can make up the pay difference with the additional year of work experience should i go straight to the field after graduating. 

I know if i leave school, i won’t come back so i don’t think coming back later is an option on the table. If you were in my shoes, would you take an additional year to get the masters degree? Or just go work with a bachelors? If you said masters degree, would you say i should do the internship for a damn near guaranteed job after but have to pay the degree out of pockets or to do the school research which makes my masters degree free? It’s also important to note, my main goal is more money.

I’m looking for thoughts/opinions/insights so if you made it this far, thanks! Lol"
u1i6df,2,2022-04-11,Advice needed: Should I stay in Dresden or move to Stuttgart?,QuitoMeister,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/u1i6df/advice_needed_should_i_stay_in_dresden_or_move_to/,"Hallo Leute!

I'm a master student from Argentina currently doing a 1-year exchange program in Germany. This winter semester I was living in Dresden doing my thesis and this next summer semester I need to do an internship. I got a position from a company I like in Reutlingen, but this position is completely online, but I was told I can go to the office if I want to (half of the team is working there) or do online instead. Since I've never been in the Stuttgart/Reutlingen/Tübingen area, this opened up some doubts whether I should stay here in Dresden or move there, so maybe you could give me your thoughts about it :)

My thoughts right now: I like Dresden so far, it's cheaper, and I already got a wg with cool roommates. The negative side is that I will have to do an internship completely online (I like working from home but going to the office some days, specially for an internship, sounds good).

On the other hand, if I move to Stuttgart/Reutlingen/Tübingen I will have the chance to go to the office, but it's probably going to be way more expensive to live there (my budget for a room in a wg is no more than 500 euros). Another positive side is that I really like nature and hiking in the mountains (I come from an area of high mountains) so it seems that living in Stuttgart will allow me to take a train and go to the German Alps to spend the day.

This has been going on for months, and if I wasn't such a coward it would likely have been fine, or at the very least better than it is.  


Anyways, I'm a sophomore in college, and I am at a major risk of failing out. It seems every semester I've had mental health problems. I spiral, get help eventually, things are ok for a while, and then next semester it happens all over again. I've been afforded every opportunity, and yet I still fuck it up massively. It's been happening since middle school at least. It's the classic ""gifted kid burnout syndrome."" I don't know anything, I feel like I've learned nothing, and I can't even take care of myself properly.  


Last semester I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation. I spent about 2 weeks in an absolute hell hole of a mental ward and I'm terrified to go back, that and the financial burden it would put on my parents. This semester everything should have been fine. I chose classes I was interested in, ones that should be just the right level of challenging, I got an on campus job, and I even started research for a professor.

The deck was completely stacked in my favor and I STILL fucked it up. In the school's housing lottery I ended up in the worst possible place, all the way down the hill. On top of that, the winters up here are cold and long, and I have 8ams. I stopped going to class and fell behind. I eventually got some help, and my roommate and I moved to a better location about halfway-ish through the semester. If I had just FUCKING REACHED OUT TO MY PROFS, it could have been fine, it could have been great. You know, a little grinding and I could have gotten caught up, but no I deluded myself into thinking that I could catch up and then go back. I was stupid. Soooooo stupid. I didn't go to class because I was so embarrassed and petrified of being yelled at or letting people down. I set the goal of getting caught up over spring break. That didn't happen because of my family pulling me every which way, and shoving every doctor appointment I needed into that week. I got back to college, and I just don't know if I can get caught up. I met with the Dean about it and they're recommending a medical withdrawal.

In the email discussion between the Dean, myself, and my profs after the meeting with the Dean, my advisor/prof is the only one who has responded, and he doesn't think there's any hope of me catching up. None of the other profs have even responded.

I'm not smart and I never have been. I got branded as the ""smart kid"" when I was a child because of undiagnosed autism (only got diagnosed like a year or 2 ago) and that I liked to read. What a load of shit. School was so easy back then that I never learned anything I needed to, I don't know how to study, I can't self discipline. My entire life seems to be centered around instant gratification.

I had to take a couple of summer classes last year in order to catch up after switching majors. Fine, whatever. The issue is that my parents will absolutely CRUCIFY me, as I had agreed that it wouldn't happen again, with cost and everything. 

I'm never going to live this down, I'm going to become my families' greatest shame. I figure it's easier to save everyone the trouble and humiliation. Even if, say, everything is ok and my parents are supportive, my father will NEVER let me live it down. I'll be guilt tripped and ""I told you so'd into oblivion."" Hell for all I know he'll kick me out. The kicker? He works in the psych field. You'd think of all people he'd get it, but that's unfortunately not the case.

Outside of a few family members, and a couple friends, I have nothing. No meaningful relationships or anything. I can't think of a single useful skill I have. I switched from engineering because I wasn't smart enough or social enough for it, and my couple of friends poke fun at that, but god it hurts. Everything is crashing around me and every second that passes I slip further. 

I just can't help myself. My counselor can give me all the advice in the world, but I'm too pathetic to take action. I'm such a passive person that I'm a fucking doormat. Every group of friends up till the current has left me, and I expect it to happen with this group too. The thought of dropping out or anything is so god damn embarrassing.

I am so absolutely petrified of failure that I can't even do the bare minimum. Even learning a language I can't do. I'm too fucking stupid. I can't brute force it because it's so damn painful and embarrassing, so I've trapped myself in a bubble of doing ""easy"" things. I haven't even drawn for months for this reason. Hell, I can't even relax. Since I was a kid it was drilled into me that everything I enjoy is a distraction from what ""really"" matters, so every idle moment, or even when I watch a show, I'm tormented by the idea that I'm ""wasting my time."" Even if I decide to try and relax, I can't decide what to do, because there's just so much.

I could absolutely use a schedule, but that loops back around to the issues of motivation, self discipline, and just starting.

I feel like a horse with a broken leg, and the end of the semester is the farmer with the shotgun. The last thing I want is to burden anyone, but I'm too much a coward to even pull the damn trigger. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. Every waking moment I'm tormented by these thoughts. I can't see it ever getting better. If these are the best years of my life... jfc what's the point of going on with it. The world is going to hell so fast. Between the climate, wars, the work environment etc. I have no hope for the future. I can't even get out of the US because of my inability to learn languages.

I know this sounds like a lot of excuses. The way I see it, there's plenty of people better off and worse off than me. However, even people so far worse than me are able to succeed, so what does that make me? I've no concept of self. My whole life I've been defined by my interests and by my reputation for being ""smart,"" but I never was, and I'll never be enough.

You may say that ""I'll never know what the future has in store,"" or something along those lines, but considering this has been a cycle going on for years, I think I have a pretty good idea. 

This massive block of text is such a mess, I'm just typing everything as I go, no cohesion. God, even my mom has given up hope for me. I had a long text convo last night, and christ, I lover her more than anything, but one of the things I brought up was that I'm not even attracted, and I'm sure she didn't mean it this way, but she said ""I was (were in the actual message but there was more to it, so I'm adjusting it a bit."" She kept asking about my plan for the future, or if I'm dropping out, and she asked multiple times if she should just cancel the moving stuff. The best answer I could give would be take out a life insurance policy and make plans to sell my belongings.

On top of that, because of how depressed and a whirlwind of appointments and responsibilities, I missed the opportunity to apply for the internship I wanted. By one. fucking. day. I thought I had more time, I guess not. I haven't even told my mom about this part yet, she's going to be so disappointed at best, and god only knows at worst.

Another thing that was carved into my psyche as a kid is the old, ""earn your keep,"" sort of mentality. Where if I can't contribute, I'm not worth what it takes to keep me around, and regardless of the fact that I don't hold others to these standards, I feel chained to these standards, and the toxic hell hole of a school I grew up in. That school, it breaks people. 

I have another meeting with the dean tomorrow, I'm guaranteeing it ends in a mental breakdown. Depending on how it goes, I have a couple plans, neither of which are good.

I feel like I had a lot more to say, but I can't even think straight right now. If you made it this far, thanks. I just worry, if I go through with it, will anyone even remember me? Would anyone even care? I've never contributed anything, never accomplished anything. I don't know what lies beyond, but god, it's terrifying. I hope I can finally toughen up and do it."
u1jnr9,11,2022-04-11,Straight to university or year-long internship?,Virtuix_,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/u1jnr9/straight_to_university_or_yearlong_internship/,"Hi, I've got a big decision to make within the next few days and I really don't know what to do! Any thoughts or advice would be very much appreciated.

First some background information: I currently have an offer to study Electronic and Information Engineering at my top choice university, Imperial College London. I am currently down to go there this year. A few months ago, under my Electronics teachers recommendation, I also applied for an internship at a technology company in Cambridge. I honestly didn't expect to get it, however after several rounds of interviews, I ended up getting an offer yesterday.  I'm now stuck with the dilemma as to whether I should continue with my plan to go to Imperial, or defer entry for a year and do the internship.

Pros of doing the internship:
- It will give me a break from studying for a year. I don't feel particularly ""burnt-out"" from A-Levels, however the prospect of working on real-life engineering projects for a change does excite me.
- I'll receive lots of training which may give me a bit of a headstart in some aspects of my university course (in particular coding in Python/C++).
- I'll get to live in Cambridge which is a really nice city. 
- I'll gain a lot of independence, most notably I'll be financially independent from my parents for the year.
- ""Why not?"". I'll still be getting the same 4 years at Imperial, just a year later than I would otherwise. I'm arguably not missing out on anything.

Cons of doing the internship:
- Given how high rent prices are in Cambridge (~£200 a week) and the salary is £19.5K annually, I'm unlikely to build up much in terms of savings. This isn't a huge factor for me, however.
- I'd be a year older and might feel ""left out"". I know this is the main concern for a lot of people taking gap years.
- I'd have one less year of earning a full ""degree"" salary.

Please let me know if there any more factors I haven't considered, as well."
u1l9hg,5,2022-04-11,Ideas for a summer intern,ThePantsAreFake,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/u1l9hg/ideas_for_a_summer_intern/,"I'm excited to have my very first high school summer intern starting in June.  

He has some some good basics and has participated in some capture the flag competitions.  Seems bright and highly motivated so I'm looking forward to introducing him to cybersecurity without overwhelming him.

He's not familiar with some of the more common tools so I thought I would start there.  My day to day work involves a lot of Nessus, Burp, Splunk, tcpdump and Wireshark.  It also includes spreadsheets out the ass, so I thought I'd steer clear of that. ;)

Any of these could be a summer internship on its own if you want a deep dive.  But I think I'll start with with just getting him familiar with them all and how they are used together.

Anyone been in this situation before?  Does what I'm proposing sound about right, is it overwhelming, or is it lacking some fundamental tenet of cybersec?"

Reading Bowl - co-founded this club and became President after my former teacher (also sponsor) was willing, managed to get all the way to region last year and state this year

Middle School Reading Bowl - since the teacher for the MS team retired, I stepped in as coach and took the team to regional and state wins

Internships - one at Next Gen Focus for tutoring

Tutoring Hours - aiming for 200-300 at the end of high school

Sports - Organized a Basketball League between 2 neighborhoods with weekly games/tournaments

Part of school cricket team

Finance/Investment Club - just a member, maybe gain credentials to show econ interest

St Jude’s Fundraising Campaign - goal of 1K to raise for Childhood Cancer causes

Research Paper on History/Econ Interconnection - writing with a mentor from my school (very smart junior) (this stemmed from academic bowl background and interests, so not random)

Research Paper on Social Equality/Justice in schools - Trying to partner with a PhD to write a paper addressing certain issues and resolving them

Data Science Class sponsored by Wells Fargo - Summer 30 hr program in which our group won a scholarship to Carolina University

Starting an Academy Co-founder - Me and 2 others from my neighborhood came together to form a “organization” to help the kids in our neighborhood with school, grades, tutoring, advice for future, etc and used the money from that business and gave to charities - raised over $25K

NHS - join the club, show leadership skills

Became director of operations/VP of YouthforFinance - an educational nonprofit teaching financial literacy to underprivileged communities, planning on going national and international

Built an app for the organization/academy created above to provide quick and easy access to any willing to try us out

Built an app connecting refugees/homeless shelters to the restaurants in order to limit food waste and to feed the hungry

Developed an app linking CS with business (my major) and finance/econ to design a stock exchange/stock market simulation game to maybe cross 100k downloads

&amp;#x200B;

PS - would a list like this with good grades (1500+ SAT, 14 APS, 4.0/4.4 UW/W GPA, etc) get me into schools like GA Tech, MIT, Stanford, Brown, etc (BTW im an in state GA kid)"

u1mjua,1,2022-04-11,Question about Cybersecurity careers:,blizzard_is_lanky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u1mjua/question_about_cybersecurity_careers/,"Hello, I'm a high school student and I've done quite a decent amount of career research on Cybersecurity. I've seen plenty of reviews saying that after college, it's very unlikely to land a Cybersecurity job because most of these jobs require prior experience in the IT field. Here's my questions:

1. What jobs should I look for after I graduate college in order to begin my career path in Cybersecurity? (I will be majoring in Computer Science)
2. How hard is it to actually land an internship for a Cybersecurity job as a college student? I heard that it's an option, but apparently it's very hard to do.
3. If I get a job as some other CS subfield (lets say a developer or something with networking), work there for a couple of years, and study for certs and hack the box in my free time, would that count for experience that employers are looking for? Or are they specifically looking for Cybersecurity-related experience?"
u1n67u,5,2022-04-11,"Which Summer Should I Choose (SSP, Thrive Scholars, BOASL, etc.",refugeofskin,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/u1n67u/which_summer_should_i_choose_ssp_thrive_scholars/,"I need urgent help! I have been accepted into multiple prestigious free summer programs and need help choosing one.

For context, I am a junior hoping to major in neuroscience, psychology, or cognitive science, with a possible pre-med pathway. If I do not go premed I may want to work in some kind of biomedical field or in clinical psychology.

Some of my best ECs are CMU SAMS, volunteering with children, and science clubs.  

I am really hoping to get into schools like **Stanford and Rice University** (my top two!), as well as **Vanderbilt University or Yale University** as I am not rich and need a school with generous need-based aid.

I recently got into the following programs:

*Summer Science Program* (SSP)

*Thrive Scholars*

*Bank of America Student Leaders*


and await decisions from 

*Hamilton Scholars*

*MOSTEC*

And I am very confident in those applications.

I know that SSP is very prestigious, selective and that most students go on to attend MIT, Stanford, and Ivy League schools. I am incredibly grateful for my acceptance. However, my one downside is that it is only for one summer. I am concerned that as a first-gen, low-income minority student a program like Thrive Scholars would provide me with the support I need for college and career for 6 years. But then again, SSP would give me a huge advantage in experience and if put on my resume would help me get research internships in college, which would help with going pre-med. Bank of America Student Leaders would allow me to work with a local nonprofit; I was one of five people chosen in my market so I am nervous that I would be turning down a great opportunity. However, working 40 hours a week when I have college applications to write sounds like it would be very stressful. Here I have my pros and cons list:

**SSP:**

Pros:

*Very prestigious, selective, extremely well-known amongst AOs

*great science experience

*higher chance of getting into dream schools

*research experience would help me in college and career

*36 students in my cohort, so I will get sufficient attention from professors

Cons:

*Very intensive

*Not marketed towards my demographic (I am a low-income URM with little educational background in my family, so I worry I will not fit in.)

*only one summer

**Thrive Scholars:**

Pros:

*6 years long, including 2 summers

*stipend each year I complete college

*most students are first-gen, low income URMs like me

*additional career mentorship 

*essay help, SAT prep, intensive academic sessions that prepare me for college

Cons:

*no official data on what colleges students go to (however I know based on Instagram lurking that a good percentage get into T20s

*300 students

**Bank of America Student Leaders**

Pros:
*Paid internship

*I can reapply next year (if I don’t choose thrive, but not guarantee I’ll get in)

*prestigious I think 

Cons:

*don’t think it will help me in college

*40 hour workweek when I need to write college essays

**MOSTEC:**

Pros:
*Prestigious, very well-known amongst AOs

*students are similar to me

*STEM focused with some college essay help

Cons:
*Virtual! :(

*less than one year

Can you guys help me decide or at least get a better view of my choices? I don’t have anyone else to go to: my mother is inexperienced with college and summer programs, and my school counselor is unavailable."

I have very few people to talk to, and knowing that random people across the world care about each other is certainly enough to make my day.

I have felt miserable for the past six years and I can't stand it anymore. I have considered suicide several times, and it seems to be coming up more and more frequently. I really don't want to die, but at this point, I cannot stand to live. I feel like a black hole has sucked away all of my hope, joy, and energy, leaving me as nothing more but an empty shell of a once-enthusiastic kid. Please, for the love of all that is good, help me.

For some background, I am a 16-year-old male living in an affluent community where it is widely believed that there is only one path to success: go to school, go to college, get a high-paying job, and be happy. By all standards, I am my community's holy child; I have perfect grades, I am incredibly intelligent, I am naturally talented at most everything, I am (was) a varsity athlete, and- most importantly- I understand myself. I could have any job I want. The issue is that I don't want one. At all. I don't want a job (nor do I think I could hold one for very long before I got bored and quit) and I don't want to be traditionally successful. I want to enjoy life for what it is, not what humans have decided to make it. I want to be like the hunter-gatherers of yore, appreciating life and each other. I want to give others joy. I want to want to live. However, it appears that this is not an option. I feel trapped, with my only options being to get a job or die, impoverished, incarcerated, or alone. I have considered damn near every occupation and I've tried every hobby, activity, or study that I found mildly interesting and I have nothing to show for it. I just want to live how humans (and every single other animal on the entire planet) are supposed to. On top of my deep dissatisfaction with (please read in Joker's voice for full effect) *society*,  I have had depression for over six years. I have tried medication, counseling, therapy, you name it. I have asked others how to overcome my feelings of hopelessness and consequently tried work, internships, volunteering, and just relaxing. I'm still miserable. I hang out with friends, participate in school and sports, explore my interests (which, for the past few years, have not existed), and still come out feeling like absolute shit. Even after moving onto a large plot of land and being able to do whatever I want outdoors (one of the two things I still enjoy), my misery continues unabated. I have already wasted some of the supposedly happiest years of my life doing things I would never want to do, and I am forced to dedicate my life to something I both hate (which is a word I use very scarcely) and morally disagree with (hint: it starts with an S and ends with a chool- for context, my community prioritizes school above all else so most people, including me, have upwards of 3 hours of homework every day in addition to the constant stress in school). I cannot and will not go on with this any longer. I cannot live like this for another two years just to get my piece of paper and finally be able to live.  I need change now. Whether that means I miraculously find a way to be happy or jump off a building and end it all, I do not care. I just need something to change.

Please help. Thanks, and sorry if anything was confusing.

P.S. Please do not reply with ""life isn't fair"" or ""get your head out of your ass"" (or, in the case of the hunter-gatherer thing, ""dying of hunger and disease isn't fun, kid""). It does not help anyone. Thanks."

Further, I am planning to apply to MS programs and would love it if someone could help with helping me shortlist universities to apply to. I am mentioning relevant details below. 

CGPA - 8.57 / 10.0 

Papers - 2 first author conference papers \[1 at BMVC (one of the top conferences in CV), 1 at ICANN (core C)\], 1 workshop paper 

Work ex (as of now) - 1 Research Intern IISc (thesis for my undergrad degree which resulted in the BMVC paper), Research Intern at Microsoft Research since July

LORs - 2 strong (prof at univ, advisor at MSR), 1 moderate/strong (not completely sure about the thesis advisor)

&amp;#x200B;

Universities I plan to apply for MS -

Stanford (MS CS); UIUC (MS CS); UT Austin (MS CS); GATech (MS CS); UCSD (MS CS); McGill/MILA (MS CS); UMass (MS CS); EPFL/ETH (don't know if I have good enough cg for these programs)

Apart from these, I would try to apply to 3-4 PhD programs.

u1scsq,1,2022-04-12,Second guessing PC build.,Acceptable_War7515,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/u1scsq/second_guessing_pc_build/,"
Fair warning, this is a little long but I’d really love some opinions on this. I tend to overthink situations a lot, and some reinforcement or advice for my perspective would appreciated.

I’m a Mechanical Engineering major in my internship year and heading back to school next September for my final year.

Some background, for the last 3 years of my Uni schooling, I’ve been using a MacBook Pro 2017 (I know I fucked up when buying it considering my program, but none the less it has held up to this point, with boot camp). So in my field it’s not ideal.

I also have a PS5, that I am considering selling in the event that I pull the trigger on this.

Recently, I’ve been building a pc (largely for gaming, and other task, light/mid use of AutoCAD, Revit, Solidworks etc…)

But now that I’ve got my parts picked out for the most part, my friend and I were talking and he brought up some fair points. First of all my build is about $3k (2.8-3 range). This budget although affordable, I have never spent this much on anything to date. I’ll list the parts below, but he asked me that considering my build and the price of it, will I be optimally using it and why not instead just keep the PS5 and even then was I using my console a lot prior to the decision to build?

My main argument, that I had to combat this question, was that the limitations on the console was that it was too restricted in terms of game accessibility (larger selections on Steam), as well versatility (can use the pc for work or other tasks if necessary). 

To which he reminded me that he and a few of my other friends had built pc’s and haven’t really committed to them.

Keeping in mind what I’m coming from and have had, and where I am in life. What do you think, my knowledge when it comes to building is 

If you could provide some insight from experience, or elsewhere don’t hesitate. 


Thank you for reading.

Things go quite well. It’s a small company so we see and work directly with everyone from the Director to the Interns everyday. I actually like my team and for the first time in a couple of jobs, I have the feeling of “belonging” to a team, that we can conquer any project. 

And I have a Team Leader who is at the same age as I am, with kind of the same life experience (background, family situation, living abroad,..) as mine. We also share some viewpoints of life, which is not a typical thing in people of our age. So, I had a crush on her and I think she know. But we keep our interactions mainly at the professional level as we both understand that our situation is not normal. 

Then out of the sudden, the Director left the job about 2 months ago to go back to his home country. Was a minor shock to me but I thought we will be fine (turn out, no). Next, the Manager left the job 1 month later, right at the time I moved to this city for a better offer, partly due to the departure of the Director. Then earlier today, my Team lead told me that she will leave soon, same reason.

Right now my feeling is mixed. Our current project will be handled by me. I’m okay with that, just the thought of no longer have a team that I enjoy working with is .. sad. Plus I’m not sure how should I react to her departure

1) How did you guys cope up with the continuous stress of studies and doing projects and looking for internship in your college days? Ik it's silly but I've been thinking too much about it.

2) How to get better at logic building. Although everyone around me either talks about projects, leetcode or codeforces i particularly think that without good programming i won't be able to make decent projects.

3) how to have an approach for projects: we've been asked since 3rd sem to present a mini project for each semester. So far I've been able to make projects watching YouTube tutorial videos which make me feel that these projects won't be of much help to me. So I wanted to know how do you guys made your projects or how can I start them properly

4) How much important are internships and how to get them: Although I have many projects in my arsenal, i really want to experience how work culture is their in Indian corporate. What are the processing and what are the things I can learn by working for a company. If possible can you also suggest a technology or framework i should work on that is in demand for organizations.

__________________________________________________

About me:

I'm changing a few details and leaving the rest vague for the sake of privacy/ anonymity and brevity. But, bewithout straying too far from what my career actually entails, let's say I work in a specialized form of care/caretaking. Hence the quotation marks around ""care"" below.
__________________________________________________

Summary: 

-I had an interview several weeks ago for a pretty major (and if I'm being honest, dream) role with a new company that's just in its infancy stages but seems like it has serious potential and is going to succeed. Even if it doesn't take off as expected, the experience I'd gain from working for them would be invaluable. The position they'd place me in would allow me to teach and present my work to clients remotely on a national/potentially international scale. 

-Then I seriously F***** up. After I got what looked like at least a trial period hire, I ghosted. For a few reasons that make sense to me +listed below), as well as others that are beyond me, but none of which are acceptable. To put it bluntly:  I think I got scared and self-sabotaged. I also think my hands are so fulm right now I was worried I wouldn't be up to the task. 

-Now I need help formulating an apology.  Of course, I want a second chance, too. But first I'd like to know what you guys think about asking for one. 
Do I expect one? Not really. But I'm open to any and all advice about how to approach writing the HM and PE who interviewed me. 
__________________________________________________

Backstory: 

To be established and taken seriously in this subfield of care, you need an MA or higher degree, hundreds of hours of related hands-on experience, internships , etc., and a  certification / liscence in this specialized area. I have everything but the liscence, which is the final but crucial step (even with the degree and work experience, the liscence separately requires studying, hours, completion of an exam, etc.,... similar to taking the bar exam in order to practice law...if that makes any sense).  More on this later. 

-I want to emphasize that, until recently,
I got a ton of fluke, scam, or misdirected job leads. For ex: People thinking I was certified in entirely different specialities, or more often, people looking for someone who provides general care with a much lower skillset and salary than my own (metaphorically akin to being offered a babysitting job for a 5 year old rather than a position providing behavior modification for an adult with a psych disorder). 

So when a (almost absurdly goodlooking, to the point of being a stock photo model) hiring manager reached out to me first on a job site, and both he - and later my potential employer - remained  extremely vague when it came to describing the role in any detail despite my numerous requests/questions leading up to the interview, I had my reservations. Now, I think that this was because they were being tight-lipped and cautious about sharing their vision for the company before meeting me.

Nevertheless, at the time, I almost canceled the interview and did NOT go into it very hopeful or adequately prepared. (I luckily dressed appropriately, but my shirt was wrinkled, my hair could have looked more presentable, I wasn't wearing makeup when I probably should have been that day. Plus, I didn't bring a pen or paper, didn't have my resume on hand - though they didn't ask for it - and didn't come prepared with follow-up questions, and so forth. Ugh.).

To make matters worse, I was (inwardly) taken aback by how incredibly polished, corperate, planned out and large-scale to his operation turned out to be. I've worked for one large company in the past,  but until now have subsisted/existed mainly the insular, nerdy world of academia, and when not in school or doing research, I've primarily worked independently / freelance.

Normally confident and verbose when it comes to my knowledge, I felt suddenly out of my depth and at a loss for words in this conversation about product testing and website design and a bunch of other business terms I wasn't familiar with.

At once point I made a suggestion about what I might be able to offer the company, and P.E. promptly (albiet kindly and professionally) cut me off, saying something along the lines of ""we're not there yet, leave that kind of brianstorming to me and X, let's not get ahead of ourselves"" which I took as a sign I was still very much just a potential candidate for the role and definitely not hired.

By the end of the conversation, I thought for sure the head of the company was just being polite when she suggested we follow up in a week. Turns out she wasnt. She emailed me the next week to set up a follow up meeting with rest of company!

__________________________________________________
 

Here's the part where i make everyone mad by saying what I did next. I would be mad too if I read this next part, and if people out there scold me for this, I get it/deserve it.. 

I just ghosted. 

I don't know why. 

I never ghost! If anything, normally I'm TOO good at following up with people. Even for jobs I don't want! My email skills far surpass my in-person skills and as I said, I've worked in the world of academia as well as the corperate world and with clients long enough to know exactly how and when to follow up with a PE/colleague/client. So I'm not sure why I did this, but it's tearing me up inside. 

After ghosting, I shut down entirely. I stopped checking my work emails, avoided all calls, stopped logging into LinkedIn altogether... I was hoping PE would just never follow-up but I just checked my email for the first time in 2 weeks and he has...TWICE. the most recent being 3-4 days ago. 

I need to follow up, even if just to apologize, or the stress and guilt and shame and regret are going to eat me alive. For anyone out there whose gonna judge me for taking this too seriously, sorry...this is just my personality. I need to right this. And this was a huge opportunity blown.

__________________________________________________

I do have some legit excuses for ghosting. Obviously none that make it okay, but they do give some insight into what's going on with me. You can skip these, but I included them in case anyone out there thinks I should bring them up in my reply to PE.

(Legit but still not okay) Excuses:
• I have a legit family emergency that has required my temporary but full time attention, and has upturned and l consumed my entire life for the past month. I had to take off a week from my other job.
• I just started a new part time job working as a ""caregiver"". This job pays crap and even though it's PT, it takes up the majority of my physical and mental energy....BUT these hours are the necessary final step in attaining my official advanced certification and liscence/title. I'm putting everything into this small but important role, and really don't feel I have the time or energy or mental focus needed to start such a huge new endeavor.
• I'm not sure I'm up for the task. Im a very by-the-book type. I play by the rules. Because of the kind of industry I'm in and specialized care I provide, I don't feel it's acceptable for me to take on roles I may technically be capable of performing, but don't hold the proper title or liscence for. Also, I'm still studying for my certification exam, which includes a lot of terminology I'm still unfamiliar with. (You can compare my current PT role to a medical residency; if I were a doctor in training. I might be in my last year, dying to get my hands on patients, and skilled enough to do so... but ethically/morally/technically I'm not going to treat anyone without that MD after my name).  

__________________________________________________

Anyway...
I'm planning on writing back to the HM and PE after posting this (well, hopefully after reading some feedback from you folks). 

What do you guys suggest I say? 

Of course, I will lead with an apology. 

But how should I phrase it? 
Should I be down to earth and brutally honest? 
Or formal and simple and to the point without offering too many excuses? 
Should I be confident or humble or...self-effacing? Do I leave it at that? Or try to make something work? 
Do I tell them that I desperately want(ed) this role but that their offer came at an incredibly hectic and full time in my life what with my other PT job, and that completing my hours first is my main priority / is imperitive to my career/certification? 

Any advice that isn't just ""you're an idiot for handling this this way?""

Thanks so much"
u1z06k,1,2022-04-12,"23, just lost my dad, hate grad school, need out",BostonBakedBeans36,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u1z06k/23_just_lost_my_dad_hate_grad_school_need_out/,"Hello everyone,

So, two years ago in February of 2020, I lost my dad when he was struck by a car walking across the street in the middle of the night. This was fucking insane and horribly traumatic. My dad and I were super close. We had our issues, but losing him honestly destroyed me. 

During this time period, I was about halfway through my junior year of college, majoring in communication with a minor in marketing. Like, PR stuff, basically. My family very much has a ""distract yourself with work"" mentality (definitely established in us by our dad), and so I ended up leaving to go back to school just a little over four days after his funeral. At the time and still to this day, I kind of agree with this decision. I mean, it sucked and was super hard but the alternative was what? Just feel like shit at home all day?

Anyways, I go back to school finish my degree through COVID, and about 3 months before I graduate, my advisor tells me about the graduate program at my school and that with my grades and resume I would likely be able to get a graduate assistantship, which would pay for the degree and give me just barely enough to live off of if I have a part time job. My thought, as a grieving, exhausted 22 year old who was literally just too worn the fuck down to direct my own life, was this: ""next two years of my life being told what to do while still having the image of success by being in a graduate program? sign me up!!!"" 

The idea of it was really appealing at the time. I was good at school and I could just keep doing school and basically live off that. Flash forward to the end of my first academic year and I am in shock of how long it took me to realize how bad this fucking sucks. I get no money, the work is completely unenjoyable, and worst of all the professors are such douchebags. I've never encountered people this douchey in all my entire life. One of them, I'll refer to him as Dr. Ponytail, he's like a phony marketing guru Jack Dorsey-wannabe type, is how I would describe him. He likes to brag to his students about dates he's going on, how many meetings he's been in, people he's met, etc. 

His classes are insanely difficult with super dense projects (like 80+ page packets about, like, some fucking nonprofit organization), and anytime you ask to meet with him, he feels the need to tell you that he's booked in 14 hours of business meetings every day of the week so he'd have to cancel something. This is a real human being, not a cartoon character. His 603 class, which was required for my entire cohort, literally put people in the hospital because they were so stressed with his deadlines. I was discussing it with another student before his class started one day and I joked to her that I needed inpatient therapy (which, looking back on it, wouldn't have been that bad of an idea), and he walked past us and exclaimed ""you guys are such *fucking* whiners"" 

We also had an incident where he refused to give me feedback for a big assignment, tried to get me to do revisions on it, and then no-showed me when I tried to meet with him about it. I was literally seething over this last week, I don't think I've ever been this pissed. I started thinking about how I lost my dad, came back to this school, did all these internships and got all these experiences, and all I ""cashed out"" with after graduating was more school and a professor who like to be a bad guy from a movie.

Here is where the advice part comes in. I have three weeks of school left. I am a graduate teaching assistant. I have absolutely zero intentions of staying past this year. This is also when Dr. Ponytail's class gets extra super super hard, because he likes to ramp it up extra towards the end because he likes watching us squirm (sick fuck, weirdo, I don't know what it is). I know I do not want to stay at this school and that I want to fail his class and walk away. I think I'd be fine completing my other two classes, but I hate Ponytail too fucking much to spend another second on him. There is just no way. How can I get myself a salary job (im literally talking like. low to mid 5 figures nothing insane) with health insurance and some time off. I have a Bachelor's degree, I've interned with my university athletics program, my state's golf association, a digital marketing firm, I've been a writer for my university, and my main skills are writing, photography, and graphic design. 

Is there anywhere I can go to just get hired, like by the end of the month, even? Is that at all realistic?"
u1z2h4,14,2022-04-12,School v. Student (CS @ Michigan State),jayphoward,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/u1z2h4/school_v_student_cs_michigan_state/,"Michigan State publishes a list of its full COA scholarship winners each year along with their intended majors.  Because the question of school vs. student frequently comes up, often with respect to CS, I decided to look up the CS students from past years on LinkedIn to see what they're doing now.  The ones I could find:

2016 (1): full-time SWE @ Aave (crypto)

2016 (2): (computational math) MS @ Columbia, full-time ML engineer @ Optimal Dynamics

2017 (1) : intern @ Humana, intern @ Quicken, intern @ Amazon, full-time SWE @ Amazon

2017 (2): (computational math)  intern @ Bayberry Capital, full-time analyst @ Baird Capital

2018 (1): intern @ Hyland, intern @ Quicken, undergraduate research assistant, will pursue Ph.D.

2019 (1): undergraduate research assistant, intern @ Amazon

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously no way to know how these individuals are being compensated and it's difficult to exactly quantify ""success"", but subjectively I'd say they're doing pretty well.  This, with their degrees from a school that's not in the USN T80 and is #52 (2021) for CS."
u1z7yt,10,2022-04-12,I quit my full time job as an engine programmer to go full indie,MartinLaSaucisse,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/u1z7yt/i_quit_my_full_time_job_as_an_engine_programmer/,"In a [previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/n679pj/went_part_time_indie_4_years_ago_here_is_how_it/), I explained that I went part time indie 5 years ago to make my own game with a friend. The project took way longer than expected, but now that it's almost finished we decided to quit our job and finish the project as full time indies. I figured that some people may be interested in my experience so here we are, ask me anything :)

**Quick Context**

My game is called [Super Intern Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068410/Super_Intern_Story/), it's a fun little platformer where you play an intern who's employed as a monster in a video game. The core team is just 2 people : me on the game design / programming / sound design and my friend on the art. We've been game developers for more than 10 years (12 years for me, shipped 8 games on multiple platforms using 6 different engines).

**Why quit our jobs now?**

We were in a stable situation, working only on Fridays and during the weekend and we could have stayed like that for a while, why quit then?

The biggest reason is that at some point you just want to do the real thing and stop making stuff ""on the side"" during your free time. I'm 34 and it's high time for me to launch my real company and give myself the means to succeed. You can't do great things if you don't believe in what you're doing and take some risks.

The second reason is that at the end of the development you need to pay external people for things that can't be done internally: QA, translation, marketing assets, ESRB ratings, first party validation, and so on. Some things can't be done if you don't have a company and it's complicated to run one if you're employed somewhere else (it's even illegal where I'm from).

**Mental workload and stress before**

Working on 2 projects is very challenging because you accumulate so much information all the time and the stress that results can get high very quickly if you're not careful. Hopefully the ~~NFT scammer~~ big French AAA company I was working for is a little better than most companies regarding overtime, at least at the studio I was in. I've had a few bad crunch periods that were very stressful but at some point I just decided that while it's ok to do some paid overtime from time to time, I won't kill myself and work late every day just to finish a badly planned AAA game, and it was totally okay. (there was a mild crunch period during Ghost Recon Wildlands that lasted TWO fucking years, I'm not kidding).

 Working on a AAA project is hard because there's so many moving parts all the time. Just before quitting, I was working in a 300-people team which is considered a medium sized project (which is kind of crazy). On the other side, working on a very small team (less than 50 people) is also mentally hard because there's so much to do and you almost never have enough time to do things right. Doing games is mentally hard no matter what :/

**Mental workload and stress after**

Now I just work on my own project and I'm much more relaxed mentally! I'm facing other problems of course, but those are problems that I chose to have and it changes everything.

The settings now is totally different. I'm responsible for the whole technical stack of the game, which makes me very happy because every time there's a problem I know exactly where to look. I'm also very happy that I don't have to explain my choices and argue all the time with my superiors, because well I don't have superiors! My associate and I regularly get into arguments but that's part of the design process and that's fine. We work really well together.

On the other hand, being on your own can be daunting because there's no one else to fix your mistakes or tell you what to do. You can feel lost, isolated or just plain demotivated. Some days you just don't want to work because you're tired or just because you're working on boring things. So far I've been doing okay but I now fully understand the need to have a strong self discipline. Motivation is said to be very volatile and only discipline can get you anywhere, this is very true in my experience. There's no better feeling than finishing a hard task that you didn't want to do and having a sudden boost in motivation!

Motivation is a consequence of doing hard work, not a precondition.

**The Financial Aspect**

This is of course the biggest problem when going full time. How do you get a sustainable business? My business model is simple: keep it small. I've seen game companies that would grow to 20-25 people in the first 2 years of development and crash on the third year because their first game was not successful. I just want to do things all by myself (my friend has a lot other things on his plate, not necessarily games related, so he won't join me full time on my next project).

Hopefully for me the French law is pretty good. When starting a business, they basically give you two years of salary just like if you were unemployed (as long as you don't make any profit). That plus my own cash, I think I can live at least 3-4 years without any revenue if I stay small. This should be enough for me to a) finish my current game and hopefully earn some cash and b) finish another game and earn more cash.

**Marketing &amp; promoting**

This is the hardest part for me because I have little experience and there's so many good indies everywhere. How do you promote your game? I'm still figuring this out but I've been getting advice from friends and colleagues in the industry. They all tell me the same thing: the key is regularity. You have to spend time promoting your game and again and again and again until the snowball gets bigger. Now that I'm full time indie I can do some planning and spend time doing just marketing (which I'm starting to like btw).

**What next?**

The game is scheduled to be finished by fall and there's so much to do. Our next step is to participate in the next Steam Neo Fest to get some traction! Maybe I will write another post after that? Anyway I hope this long post was worth reading, and if you have questions I'll be happy to try to answer them."

u225r5,3,2022-04-12,I Have Too Many Interests and I Have No Idea Where to Go In Life With Graduate School? LONG POST!,crystal_help_please,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/u225r5/i_have_too_many_interests_and_i_have_no_idea/,"Hi,

I just wanted to make a post because I have no idea where to go in life and education. I am 20 years old and will be graduating from undergrad after this Fall 2022 semester. My major is in global studies (or international relations) and my minor is in public health. I want to first state that I want to be able to help. I don't think I will live a fulfilling life not helping people in some way. I think I will see myself as a failure if I can't help in some way. 

I always wanted to go to law school. I thought I could help people through law and protect those who need help under the law. However, I have read there is a high burnout rate with harsh hours and strong deadlines. Also, my major counselor told me if I want to make a livable wage I need to be in private practice, which I don't think I align with. Everyone in my life has told me I would be good in law because I am a good arguer (however just because I can argue good doesn't mean I should be in law). It is something that is still a possibility, but I am walking away from it for now. 

I am now into public health and medicine. I realized I enjoy my minor more than my major (I still enjoy my major, but my minor more). The reason I think I enjoy public health more is because I realized how much over these three years I enjoy science and health so much. Global Studies gave me the activism, environmental, political, and social issues education that I like to enjoy, but I missed that analytical and science feeling. Public Health gives me that. 

So now I am/have messaged so many of my previous and current professors about career fields in public health  and have learned so much about where you can go getting a master's in public health, which is a lot of areas. I also have been talking to a college career counselor at my university and she stated I have too many interests everywhere and I need to narrow them down. However, each time I narrow it down I feel like I am missing another opportunity with the career option. 

Then I also realized how my whole life I have always been into skincare, haircare, and cosmetics of that sort and the chemistry and biology behind them. So then I was looking into dermatology. However that means medical school, internships, residency, and then if you make it through all that then dermatology school, which I don't think I want to go down the M.D. route. I enjoy how dermatology isn't just cosmetic, but can also be clinical in the sense of detecting skin diseases and illnesses such as cancers and can work on preventive care (something we learn about in epidemiology/public health). Then I've been thinking about how could I work in a public health field and work alongside dermatology and that field (not as dermatology though. I wouldn't want to claim to be a doctor in dermatology if I didn't put in that work) for research or administrative or toxicology or even education. 

I understand my possible future career probably won't be everything I want or dream of because I am tangled within so many different sectors of interest. I know I will have to miss out on one or another (I know I can also participate in charity work as well to when I have time to do the other things I am passionate about).  

I think I feel overwhelmed because I believe I have the ability to do anything I want but feel I have to be put into a box and miss out on other goals. 

I want to be able to make money as well too. Not just for myself, but for my family as well (my parents).  So I have been looking for careers that make 75k+ (of course the goal is six figures, but I want to be realistic with myself). Also want to work where the field is somewhat always changing . I can be doing something different every so often or maybe a new project. Traveling would be nice but not needed. Human interaction and communication (I could be in an office, but not all day every single day). I enjoy teamwork, but I also don't mind working alone sometimes. 

I want to say thank you for any advice anyone has. I know this is a long post and probably confusing because I am also confused and I also took out a lot to make it shorter. Thank you again!"
u22a9y,3,2022-04-12,How to reduce the risk of hiring my next employee?,arikr,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/u22a9y/how_to_reduce_the_risk_of_hiring_my_next_employee/,"Small biz, doing well.

I think there's a hire that'll make sense doing full time content creation. But I'm not sure yet, and I don't have much experience.

Right now, if I was to hire someone full time for that, there'd be multiple risks:

* Risk of will that specific person work out
* Risk of what content they'd make
* Risk of getting people to read the content
* Overall risk of what they'll be doing on a day to day

What are some ways I can reduce the risks of hiring someone for it? It feels like too much uncertainty for me to want to get someone to commit their time to full-time in person.

My ideas so far:

* Start out with a remote contractor first. Figure out the role, the content, etc with them. Then once the content and role is figured out, hire someone full time in person if I still want to.
* Do a temp-to-hire or part-time/trial-to-hire
* Hire an intern to do it for the summer or part time during their school year
* Do the content creation myself first, then hire for it
* Pay some consultants for advice and to do the first version or two
* Hire an agency to do it first
* Have my existing team members do it, even if poorly, and then hire someone else once it's kinda working with them

What do you think? How can I as quickly as possible get role figured out, in a way that's most likely to succeed"

I was wondering if is it beneficial to my career prospects by doing this placement? as I will have to go back to uni afterwards. I was thinking I could just finish my third year and do a summer internship and then land a junior software engineer job and be in a better position or basically the same.

Is there really much of a difference between the two paths? Honestly, I kind of want to get uni out of the way because I'm not really enjoying it, but at the same time I can have 1 year of experience and some money.

Do my career prospects change much if I go through the placement route vs the Summer internship -&gt; junior dev route.

Or is it basically essentially the same? Or is doing the uni route better because I could land a junior role and progress straight away or job hop whereas I have to finish uni still or will have finished by the time I job hop."
u230p1,23,2022-04-12,[Rant] Accepting my fate (re: time in poly),kermitsewercite,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u230p1/rant_accepting_my_fate_re_time_in_poly/,"Throwaway account with edgy and dramatic title, feel free to read or don’t I just needed somewhere to pen my feelings down regarding university applications. Except it’s just kind of a post filled with my regrets soo here’s my entire life story (psa don’t read if you don’t like reading about self pity, this is a rant for a reason and is fucking long): 

Did pretty well in secondary school, ended up going to poly because I refused to go to JC to study like crazy all over again and also because of mother tongue. Not really a decision I’d say I regret but I do think I should have put more thought into picking my course choices as I was just picking based on what I was ‘good’ at in secondary school. 

Fucked up really badly in my second semester for year 1, hit below 3.0 because of heavy core modules that were very memorization and study centered. Always thought that leaving studying to the last minute got me my good grades back then but came to accept that it was because I had tuition to help me sit down, focus and practice for the tests. In poly, there was nobody but myself and my lack of self discipline. The exams were too much for me and I couldn’t even manage to get a B for those particular subjects. At that point in time I still didn’t know what I wanted to do in the future and university felt so far away - don’t need to worry right? 

Not to mention being surrounded by people who were so much smarter than me made me convince myself that at least (at least!) I got a cgpa above 2.5 for my first year. I didn’t break down over my grades or anything, and moved on thinking the way I recklessly studied a week before tests and exams would somehow pull my grades up in the following semesters. 

Never did much better on my own for modules where bulk of the grades came from individual assignments, and never managed to hit above 3.0 for my second year. Told myself it was okay, I improved from y1s2 to y2s2! Not so bad! Good job me! University still felt like forever away. I had a year left, was bordering the 3s and genuinely thought I could pull myself up to a 3.4 with FYP and internship. 

Spoilers: I couldn’t. Lol.  

Y3S1 modules were very group project based, don’t want to assume that I was simply being carried by my group mates because if it’s one thing I can do is at least do my part and do well for non core/course related modules (getting A/B+ for 2 credit unit mods, much amazing). Gpa for sem 5 gave me hope, although my cgpa didn’t even increase by much. Not sure where the false hope came from, definitely wishful thinking. Told myself - okay. Shit. Fuck. Maybe it’s time to get my shit together and do well for once? It was the last stretch of my three years in polytechnic and I couldn’t even say I achieved much academically or CCA wise because I didn’t attend (was not compulsory attendance). 

However, I didn’t want to do well for the sake of university, I had just wanted to prove that I could get a 4.0 on my own, without any group projects and without anybody’s help. This last module would prove that I wasn’t so useless after all. Of course not thinking about university from the start was a big mistake because I kept telling myself getting less than 3.5 wasn’t the end of the world but turns out nobody wants you if your gpa is less than that. Big surprise!! 

Anyway, couldn’t get that A for my internship even though I sincerely and very genuinely tried my hardest. I knew it was not because of my workplace because my supervisor would have given me feedback if I was doing poorly or not up to standard. The reflections I submitted every few months couldn’t have been the reason for fucking up either, so that left the presentation. Perhaps it was my own fault for choosing an internship that wasn’t related to my course and maybe I just wasn’t entertaining enough when presenting, but fuck, did seeing a B+ hurt like hell. Felt like I was given 0.5 less because the course chair felt like they were giving out too many A’s for the module. But that’s just life, and complaining wouldn’t get me anywhere so I had to move on. 

By then, I already an idea of what I wanted to pursue, many thanks to my internship placement. Had another major in mind as well, so I foolishly applied for that thinking my grades could get me anywhere. Even up until a week ago I was still living in the daydream that I would somehow be called up for an interview. 

I’m (was?) adamant on staying local for university because it breaks my heart to let my parents suffer for the sake of my own education and failure and I already know taking a gap year isn’t what they want me to do. Obviously no matter where I go I’d be paying them back but it’s still so unsettling and now that I’ve accepted that I can’t get anywhere locally I just feel like shit all over again and truly cannot help but wonder what the fuck I was doing in poly. It was genuinely just a lack of effort when it came to studying and revising (also maybe wrong studying technique? I made notes and all that but wondered why they never helped - gonna need to fix this before uni starts). 

Again, I can’t say I regret my course, because otherwise I wouldn’t have been granted opportunities that I would consider ‘turning points’ in my life but the way I handled my studies? Major fuck up. Can’t help but wonder how much easier things would be for me during this period of time if I had gotten my shit together earlier and just studied harder. 

Somehow I feel like I should’ve never applied for local universities, giving myself this false hope that big 3 will give a shit about someone with less than 3.4. And sometimes I regret not putting more choices down, even if it was something I wouldn’t be interested in. At least I would have a place locally right? I don’t know. 

I’m certainly grateful that my parents are able to even pick up the pieces, only because they want me to get a degree as fast as possible through the Average Person Pathway of going to university and then work but I really thought I could breeze through poly and work for a year (or more) and life would be fine and dandy.  I know not many people even have the opportunity of having international unis as a backup so I genuinely cannot complain any further and if I do get accepted, I want to really restart and do well this time. 

But then I have another issue of whether the course I applied for is what I want to study since it’s a year of what I had to sit through in poly before actually delving into major specific subjects… sometimes I wonder if I’m deliberately trying to set myself up for failure. But this is a whole other grandmother story. 

TLDR: Fucked up poly. Worried about uni. Still on the fence with what I want to do in the future and even study in university but whatever. Thanks for coming to my tedtalk I’ve just been so ???? Not sure what to feel but I’ve felt very unsettled over this. (I would bold this but I don’t know how to on mobile)

Anyway, to everybody who’s anxiously awaiting uni apps - if your gpa is near the cut offs I’m sure you’ll be fine. Still early April, you will get your offer soon enough. To those who have interviews or what not - all the best! 

If anybody else didn’t manage to get what they wanted and can’t make it into uni with their scores we are brothers in arms.. I wish you guys all the best and sincerely hope things work out for all of us really. Have been told stories where people worked for a bit at companies and were given the chance to study after that. There’s many pathways that are possible and open (granted with your parent’s permission if they truly need to have an opinion on what you do in life). 

My motivation for uni will be coming back to this and going ayo look at these sick grades I got in 3 years. Look out for that"
u238rs,1,2022-04-12,Social anxiety and speech impediment?,Total_Classroom_1198,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/u238rs/social_anxiety_and_speech_impediment/,"Hi everyone! I'm 20F and have some mental health issues, social anxiety (undiagnosed) mainly. This post is quite long so I would appreciate it if anyone reads this. 

As stated in the title, I have a problem with my speech and I'm not sure if it's related to anxiety. I have always struggled with social anxiety so I thought there might be a link. I'm in post-secondary education now and have completed my first year in Accounting &amp; Finance. At first, I was scared because there are a lot of group projects and presentations, and with social anxiety, I am terrified of public speaking. I managed to give all 6 presentations without much problem, though I was unsatisfied with my performance on 2 of them (more on this later). My success with giving presentations did give me some confidence boost that public speaking is not as scary as I've imagined.

I am unhappy with my course however and have been contemplating changing to something else. Not because of anxiety but I have internship experience which made me realize that I won't be happy with accounting as a future career. Previously, I graduated with a cert in accounting from a technical school with a required internship. Despite that, I chose to continue studying accounting &amp; finance anyway because it's easy admission. Hence, I want to change my course to gerontology, a social science field about the study of aging and the career prospects of working with older adults. I have a soft spot for old people, so I don't feel anxious around them. My dream career is one that makes a difference in people's lives and I have in mind two groups of people specifically that I would enjoy working with because of personal experience – special needs kids and old people. Since my education institution offers a gerontology diploma, I think it could be a really good opportunity for me to expose myself to this field and gain first-hand experience through a compulsory internship working with old people.

This is where the problem with my anxiety and speech issues comes in. I'm not sure specifically what my speech problem is since there are different types out there. So let me illustrate with the 2 presentations I've mentioned earlier.

One was a group presentation which I thought was quite okay until the lecturer gave us her comments about our performances. For my group, she said one of us has trouble with pronunciation and even though she didn't say who it was, I knew she was referring to me. Tbh, I was surprised because I worked with my classmates for group projects and we usually had practice presentations prior to the actual presentations but nobody said anything about my speech. So I thought my speech issue wasn't too obvious. I felt upset with the lecturer's comment even though the comment was constructive rather than criticism. She gave a piece of useful advice, to look up the pronunciation of words using an online dictionary. Actually, it's not that I don't know how to pronounce words but some words just come out sounding off. 

The other presentation was quite a disaster. It was a self-recorded individual presentation. I came up with a really good script but ended up having to delete most of it. I had trouble pronouncing words with more than 3 syllables, and speaking in long sentences as my speech got messed up mid sentences. It was infuriating having to record over and over again because I kept messing up. In the end, I had to substitute words and shorten sentences. Despite that, I don't think I did badly for the presentation as my final grade for the module wasn't bad at all.

I'm not sure if it's something I have been struggling with all my life, or because of social anxiety for my speech issue. Though I think it's more of the former. I'm bilingual and my mother tongue is the language I'm more comfortable communicating in because that's the language my parents use in conversations. Even then, there are some words in my mother tongue that I can't pronounce correctly for the life of me. I think English is a harder language for me to speak for this reason. Social anxiety may only be a small contributing factor though because I noticed the difference when I give presentations vs. when I'm alone. When I give presentations in front of the class, I tend to speak faster and make mistakes as a result, due to being anxious and wanting to get it over with faster. When I'm alone without any stress, I record myself speaking. I am able to slow down and speak at a normal pace although pronunciation is still a problem for me. No difference whether I'm speaking to people or not, only the pace changes.

So it seems like I may have a speech impediment and it's the main reason for my social anxiety. I wonder if it's a good idea to change my course? Since a social science course is heavy on communication, I think speaking fluently is rather important. My past successes with my internship and presentations give me hope that my social anxiety is very manageable and that one day, I can fully overcome it. Should I change my course anyway because the actual workplace (working with the elderly) relies more on the use of my mother tongue to communicate with the elderly? I would appreciate it If someone can give me some encouragement or advice!"

I am debating whether it is worth it for me to get a bachelors in CS (or CE) at this point in my life, and would like some input from you which I will take into consideration.

For context, I was living with over-controlling parents who were keen on trying to take over my academic career while I was living with them. They did not want me to pursue CS at all ""because it is not engineering"". They had funds set aside for me to go to university and were using that as leverage over my life. I knew that I had to become independent of them if I wanted to work and/or study in this field, and that meant getting a job. I didn't feel like studying was a good option at the time as I didn't have any money of my own, and staying with my parents while studying against their wishes would not have lead to good academic outcomes anyway due to what I described above.

So, while attending a college (not university) in Quebec I went behind their backs and self-taught myself programming (while still living with them) like my life depended on it. I created a few significant open source projects, and was able to get an internship after a year of learning on my own. After that, I had a rocky start to my career quickly going from QA at one company to bouncing between dev jobs at poorly-run companies around Montreal.

This leads me to my current situation which is rather good. I am now 21, and managed to get myself a job at a decent company in Ontario making around 80k. Although I am decently happy with where I am at now I cannot help think about where I could be if I had access to formal education. I have also since met people in my field who think it is a good idea for me to get a degree. I would also really like to relocate to the USA one day not for FAANG, but because of the greater personal freedom, higher salaries and cheaper housing costs.

With all that background, would you think it is worth it for me to stop working and enroll in an accredited university? I'm on the fence about it because it would mean paying for tuition and sacrificing 4 years' worth of good income. Also, it may be possible to get into the USA through a company transfer or even winning the visa lottery. I would like your input."

The problem is the recruiting and internship process. I'm losing my fucking mind. I was informed that an engineer doesn't even look through your resume first, an auto bot and some random working at HR does. So nobody gives a shit about a side projects like compilers or video games, they only care about if you can make a website that gets a billion views. And then the compiler guys don't like that you made a ""mediocre"" compiler despite your website and video game also being pretty good, and so too the video game guy. Why am I even doing this shit? I just want to make cool shit, and learn how to make cool shit, but it seems I have to make the next damn facebook before being able to land an internship fucking anywhere. 

Sorry, I've just been very frustrated for the past month. I get that sophomores get no internships, but seriously. How am I so incompetent that I've sent 200 resumes and I haven't gotten a SINGLE interview? Am I really just that incompetent? I was told that recruiters keep getting spammed with people who don't even know how to make fizzbuzz, and even if you raise the bar to a non-SDE level I'm pretty sure I can be of use to a company. I feel just completely useless and incompetent that despite grinding for 2 years I've made absolutely 0 progress anywhere."

I’m miserable and depressed. It’s gotten to the point where I’m constantly depressed and barely able to get out of bed. I don’t wash my face or bush my teeth at night anymore. I’ve been ordering Uber eats multiple times a week bc I’m too exhausted to leave my dorm. I stopped working out. I’ve been missing class more often. At least once a week I contemplate ending my life…

It isn’t even the coursework that is getting to me. I can handle the course load fine. I’m just not doing well in literally any other aspect of life. I’m constantly stressed about my major and getting an internship over the summer. I have to two jobs. I don’t have friends because of my social anxiety. My family is a terrible support system so I can never talk to them about my struggles. I’m pretty sure my RA hates me bc I have a mental breakdown once a month. My neighbors probably do too bc like every other week I breakdown screaming and crying in my room. My anxiety is so bad I can barely present or even speak in my classes. I have a presentation tomorrow that me and my project partner are trying to get pushed to Friday bc I’m not mentally stable enough to do it tomorrow. I’m pretty sure she hates me (edit: she no longer wants to present with me).

I’ve been seeing a counselor at my schools health center and she helped me find a therapist for the summer who I will be seeing for the first time at the end of the month. Im falling apart. I feel like such a failure. I know I need to get my degree but im mentally a disaster. I can’t take a gap year bc my family would never approve of that and my dad is helping me pay to be here. I don’t know what to do. Should I even be here?"
u2claz,2,2022-04-12,Big 4 Risk Advisory,BigTaddyDaddy,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/u2claz/big_4_risk_advisory/,"Hello,

I am currently a Junior studying both finance and accounting and have accepted a summer internship offer with a big four firm in risk advisory in their DC area office. I have always been interested in risk and risk management and wanted to pursue a career in it. However, after taking a deep dive online, I am starting to figure out that risk advisory at the Big 4 is mostly just internal audit, IT audit, and SOX work that most people find extremely boring.

Since I have not yet done any work within these specific areas, I am not 100% sure that it would be boring for me, but that seems to be the general consensus. My plan was never to stay Big 4 for a long time, just to suck it up for 2-4 years before leaving for a better position at a client's company. But now, I am also reading that the progression and exit opportunities for people in risk advisory are not good at all either.

So I am very confused and nervous about what I should do now. Should I complete the internship but look for a different position to start at after graduating? Or is the risk advisory hate just being overhyped and I may actually enjoy it? Should I suck it up for a few years and then get out or avoid it all together?

Any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Teacher 1 - have taken 4+ classes from them in HS (small school lol) so probably a strong LOR.

Teacher 2 - she seems to like me and used my essays a handful of times as examples in AP Lang. Probably also a strong LOR.

Did not read either LOR so can't rate them or comment much.

**Interviews**

MIT - Went decently well, was a bit awkward though and I had to do it at school due to scheduling, so I was wearing a mask the whole time which made it feel less personal. Was my first interview too, and didn't come all that prepared.

Stanford - Went better than MIT, I connected w the interviewer a bit better. Still wasn't that prepared as I only had a few questions about Stanford, didn't do much research on the school ahead of time.

**Essays**

My essays only got proofread by my mom, and she didn't really think they were that great at the time. I also agreed for the most part. Looking back at them, they were decent though and were pretty true to me I think. I also didn't read any example essays at all I think? So maybe they were more unique than most are as I was just going off of the prompts and general essay advice rather than trying to emulate someone else's essays subconsciously or something. I spent a long time figuring out what to write for all my essays, but a more moderate amount actually writing them and editing them.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UW Seattle *- Engineering undeclared, no merit and didn't get into the honors college*
* CWRU (EA) - *$40.5k merit scholarship*
* Rensselaer (EA) - *can't remember scholarship, wasn't a lot though*
* Colorado School of Mines - *roughly $10k merit I think*
* WashU (RD)
* Hopkins! (RD)
* Stanford!!! (RD)
* MIT!!!! (RD) - *Super excited, probably will comMIT here :)*
* Also my 3 safeties, all of which I liked quite well.

*Waitlists/Rejections:*

* *None somehow, very fortunate.*

**Additional Information:**

I had very low expectations for my reach schools. Still not sure what made my application standout - maybe some less standard ECs + solid essays? Anyway, I'm very thankful to have all the great options that I do, though, especially since I enjoyed all of high school and didn't find the application process too painful.

Anyways, now I need to decide.. Stanford, MIT, or UW Seattle? UW would be much cheaper and I prefer the location to either Cambridge or Palo Alto, but otherwise Stanford and MIT are probably better options.

***Edit cuz I forgot about this part:*** I commute to school which is a fairly big time commitment and not your average commute (is both nicer and more inconvenient at the same time vs a more normal commute like taking the bus across town or something like that). I think this probably helped a lot for my app, as I could have gone to a much closer school but put a fairly significant amount of effort into going to a better school instead. My ECs are obviously a bit weaker than most people who end up with similar results, so perhaps the additional info about my commute helped show that I didn't really have much opportunity for more ECs or more prestigious/traditional ECs. idk though."

history/gov teacher (8/10): she sponsored model un and taught me for 2 years. she helped me prepare for the application process for a gov/policy-centric scholarship before college apps, and she was known for writing good LORs

math teacher (8/10): she taught me for 1 year but had known me for longer, and she sponsored math club. we talked a lot outside of class

counselor (6.5?/10): wasn't super close with her, but i went to her for advice on pursuing poli sci and ended up crying in her office because my parents weren't yet supportive of that path, which led to me being a lot more open than most people probably

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

mit (6.5/10): didn't really know what to expect. it was more of a convo than a q&amp;a

princeton (7/10): more of a q&amp;a and was pretty short. my interviewer told me she wanted to know about my experience in policy in order to focus her report on one thing, and didn't really ask about other things

stanford (8/10): was also more of a q&amp;a but we'd branch off into convos after some of my answers. covered more breadth of my activities but not as much depth

yale (7.5/10): interviewer was an alum from my hs (current grad student) so we were able to talk about teachers and clubs and stuff. the interview started off a little awkward but ended a lot better

upenn (4.5/10): this was my worst one lmaoo, i was pretty bland and forgettable. my interviewer told me she hoped i got into my dream school at the end 😭 thought i threw away my shot at penn because of the interview

harvard (9/10): would've rated this higher. but after discussing with my friend who had the same interviewer i realized it was amazing because the interviewer was super cool + a phenomenal conversationalist, and not because of me. i covered everything i wanted to, and we talked a lot about his time at harvard

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

common app (6.5?/10): talked about doing creative writing in my free time and how it led to growth. tied in math modeling

supplementals: they were decent, i focused on my policy ECs and mental health with student gov a lot in RD. ngl i only planned out mit, yale, and stanford supps ahead of time, but i liked the essays i reused/used as templates for multiple schools

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* **UPenn (wharton)**
* Columbia
* Rice
* CMU
* UCLA
* Berkeley
* GWU (presidential scholarship + women's leadership program)
* UNC Chapel Hill
* FSU (honors college + full ride oos)

* GATech (deferred EA &gt;&gt; WL RD)
* Bowdoin
* Northeastern

*Rejections:*

* MIT (deferred EA &gt;&gt; rejected RD)

**outcome**: was deciding between penn and columbia, but wharton aligns much better with my goals! i am a bit worried about the campus culture + competitiveness, but i'd have the same concerns about any t20. not rly sure what to expect from either college though so any advice is appreciated!

* severely panicked after EA results and shotgunned schools that were not a good fit
* since i EA'd tech schools only, i thought i was supposed to be a STEM person until mid-december. but i realized i could talk about my passion for policy in a way i couldn't about math, and incorporated policy/combined my interests a lot better RD"

I’ll outline the pros/cons of each offer below. I’m an information systems major graduating in December 2022. 

**Offer 1: Payment Management Intern, Universal Studios**

• $15.50 per hour

• Working in accounting department (but I don’t really like accounting or want to go into finance)

• Involves data analytics though which is why I applied

• Have worked here before and loved the culture, would be more fun than the other offer

• In-person, would be able to meet other interns and network… much bigger company as well



**Offer 2: Business Systems Intern, small application security company**

• $22 per hour

• Remote 

• Working with data integration

• High turnover rate and questionable Glassdoor reviews

• I would be the only intern in the entire company

• More aligned with my major and what I want to do in the future


Any advice?"
u2eq24,1,2022-04-12,Undergrad that wants to get into top CS PhD program. What steps should I take?,literal-feces,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/u2eq24/undergrad_that_wants_to_get_into_top_cs_phd/,"I hope you're having a wonderful day.

I'm a second year Computer Science student at an alright university in Canada, that wants to get into a top PhD program and ultimately do research and become a professor. As of now, the most interesting research area to me is optimization and ML, though this could change as I am still exploring other fields. The issue is, my university's CS department isn't the best when it comes to research so there isn't much opportunities to get undergrad research experience in my field. However, I was able to land a summer research assistant position in the Psychology and Neuroscience department. 

Over the upcoming summer I will be taking a few math related courses (Calc III, Applied Linear Algebra, Intro to Diff Equations), alongside my research gig.

By taking these summer courses, I will have completed approximately a semester worth of courses, which allows me to take a semester off in my 4th year to do an internship without delaying my graduation. I could use this semester to do a research internship if I get lucky.

I am also open to doing a masters before going into a PhD, but I heard that masters applicants are compared to higher standards.

Of course, I wouldn't mind being accepted into a top PhD program. So I went through the faculty list at some universities and bookmarked a few potential advisors based on research interests. I feel like it is too early to reach out to them so I'm not sure what to do with list for now. 

While I am aware LoRs and research experience are more valuable, my gpa did tank a bit last semester due to a medical condition I was being treated for. After this semester I am expecting it to be around 3.6-3.7. I am picking things back up though.

With all this information considered, what are some steps I could take towards improving my chances at getting into a top PhD program (t10).

If you require anymore info, please let me know.

Thanks in advance!"

I’m miserable and depressed. It’s gotten to the point where I’m constantly depressed and barely able to get out of bed. I don’t wash my face or bush my teeth at night anymore. I’ve been ordering Uber eats multiple times a week bc I’m too exhausted to leave my dorm. I stopped working out. I’ve been missing class more often. At least once a week I contemplate ending my life…

It isn’t even the coursework that is getting to me. I can handle the course load fine. I’m just not doing well in literally any other aspect of life. I’m constantly stressed about my major and getting an internship over the summer. I have to two jobs. I don’t have friends because of my social anxiety. My family is a terrible support system so I can never talk to them about my struggles. I’m pretty sure my RA hates me bc I have a mental breakdown once a month. My neighbors probably do too bc like every other week I breakdown screaming and crying in my room. My anxiety is so bad I can barely present or even speak in my classes. I have a presentation tomorrow that me and my project partner are trying to get pushed to Friday bc I’m not mentally stable enough to do it tomorrrow. I’m pretty sure she hates me (edit: she no longer wants to present with me). 

I’ve been seeing a counselor at my schools health center and she helped me find a therapist for the summer who I will be seeing for the first time at the end of the month. Im falling apart. I feel like such a failure. I know I need to get my degree but im mentally a disaster. I can’t take a gap year bc my family would never approve of that and my dad is helping me pay to be here.

I have no internship experience and my projects are not really impressive. I hardly get passed the first interview/phone call because I just have so little to show for myself since I didn't realize how competitive the market is throughout college.

I go to a school with a relatively small CS department, so I was just comfortable in my classes and routine and thought I'd be totally fine. Now I'm realizing I was wrong being so comfortable like that and not doing more outside of class.

Would it be alright to take time off (like 2-3 months?) after graduating to work on better projects and LC questions? Maybe pick up a new skill/language? Or would that negatively affect my job prospects due to the time gap? 

I feel pressure to find a job ASAP but all the rejections have been getting to me especially seeing so many people secure opportunities, so I think maybe I should stop applying for now while I improve my application. But I'm conflicted so I thought I'd ask on here"

u2gt70,3,2022-04-12,Haven’t had a manager since January. What would you do in my situation? How do I express myself without getting fired or crying?,Last_Instance_9519,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/u2gt70/havent_had_a_manager_since_january_what_would_you/,"I work for a start-up and my department was originally me (entry-level position, 1 year of experience &amp; 1 year out of college) and my manager (5-6 years of experience with a PhD). My manager quit in January and my CEO &amp; CTO still hasn’t filled her position. 

I’ve picked up all of the slack and I’ve still been carrying out our projects according to plan. I’m starting to feel frustrated because they are taking so long to find someone &amp; they don’t want to promote me. I can understand not wanting to make me head of the department, but I feel like I should at least move a level up to what I do now considering that I hire and onboard all the interns, still carry out projects, and nothing has gone to shit yet. I also feel like I’m at a disadvantage because all the other departments get more structure and have project management plans, career growth OKRs, and I don’t get that because my CTO still hasn’t had time to schedule a 1:1 with me.

I’ve considered quitting but I feel like it will ruin my relationship with my CTO if I leave them right now when they have no one else. The CTO has connections to almost every company in the industry and I’m worried that if I get upset or state how I really feel, or try to quit, he’d ruin my reputation at other companies in the future. 

How do I express how I feel to the CTO without ruining my relationship with him? Also, should I just give up and start looking at other jobs? Part of me feels like it’s not worth the hassle of trying to prove my worth to get a promotion when I could get one at another company now."

u2hzih,21,2022-04-13,Quitting my job of 8 years and they paln to replace me with someone a job class and pay scale above my current position.,peeppoll,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/u2hzih/quitting_my_job_of_8_years_and_they_paln_to/,"I started with my current employer 8 years ago as an intern heading into my final half of undergrad. The internship was great and I did very well so they offered me a 30-35 hr a week position to stay on. It was great because it allowed me to take early morning classes and evening classes and make money I desperately needed to pay for school. Back then it was $10/hr and to get experience in my field at $10/hr before graduation was unheard of. My bosses back then were all great and I really enjoyed most of my coworkers. 

Fast forward 2 years. At this point I'm done with school and working there full time with a new position slightly above market average for my degree. I have been dating my now wife for about a year and just signed a lease on my first car. All my previous cars at this point have been some used beaters. Several of the other high performing interns of the last few years were also being hired so I finally had people I can relate to in the office. 

One of the top bosses who was a mentor to me unexpectedly dies. New boss has very different ideas but keeps the same senior leadership. My manager who was also in charge of most of the senior management being one of the leaders who the new boss keeps. The boss who passed was also a mentor to my manager who originally started as the dead boss's intern. My manager and I started to get pretty close during this time given our shared relationship with our late mentor. 

Some of the senior leadership over the next year or two starts to move on or retire and the new hires are mostly garbage or unqualified. My manager and I get annoyed at a lot of it since other people's incompetence ends up creating more work for us. I end up getting a few performance based pay raises throughout this time for taking on the additional work so I'm not too upset.

My manager tells me about a year and a half into the new boss's tenure that he plans to leave in about a year and that he plans to take care of me and get me into mid level management by the time he leaves. My manager follows through but the transition to a new business unit is still in process at the time of his departure. One of the other senior leaders gets promoted into my managers position and this is where shit gets fucked. 

New manager allows the transfer to go through, but alters the transfer. I end up getting a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller pay bump and no title promotion with the transfer once it's done. The senior manager I now work for is pissed off about it since I have helped her with a lot in my old position and was coming over to help rebuild the business unit. I'm also going to be making 25k less than the person who previously had the same position I am now in. She tries for about a year to get it fixed and my old manager's replacement keeps blocking it. She ends up being forced into retirement over something else. 

(Inb4 you should have left for a new job at this point in the story)

We then go a year without a manager and are direct reporting to another unit manager who had retired from a pension position and was hired by us after she retired. She is never around and never checks in with me or the other mid level managers. The other mid level folks are both 15+ years in with kids, they need their jobs. We agree to have each other's backs and run the unit better than it has ever ran. Revenues, workloads, and performance are all up across the board. They bring on a national headhunter for 50k and go a year without finding a single qualified replacement. They never consider me or my peers for the position and end up resolving the vacancy by making our interim report our permanent report.

At this point they finally get around to processing the promotion I was supposed to get when I transferred two years ago. New manager is hardly around and the other mid level managers and I are getting increasingly frustrated. I begin looking for another job. 

Go on several interviews. Some with organizations I have done work with and they are all offering me much better jobs. Some encouraged me to apply over  dinners or drinks and then hire someone else. 

Come to today, I have finally found something I want to take and told senior leadership last week I plan to leave for this new job and gave them a departure window of July for the new job (I have a ton of vacation I need to use before I leave). Senior management met with me today to ask about who I think may be a good fit to replace me. They didn't seriously listen to my suggestions and instead tried to convince me to say and tell me things like ""you're one of our top performers"" or ""this really screws us, what will it take for you to stay."" The number 2 at the company then says during all of this that they realize that my future replacement will need to come in at a higher pay grade and title above where I am now. 

That title and pay grade they are going to post my job at is exactly where the guy I replaced was when I transferred into the unit 3 years ago..... This is also the title and pay that the same number 2 guy screwed me out of when the transfer to this position happened. 

TLDR: start career as an intern, bosses are great, get brought on full time. First boss who was my mentor unexpectedly dies. New boss keeps senior managers. My manager leaves shortly after. I get fucked out of a promotion during a transfer because new manager is a dick. Few years later get some smaller promotions and recruited into a new job. Company is now saying they need to replace me at the rate and title of what the OG promotion was going to be before the new manager stopped it."

u2ihub,4,2022-04-13,I need to come unstuck,DiegosGirl,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/u2ihub/i_need_to_come_unstuck/,"Hey friends, I'm a (very soon to be) 24 year old woman who's crashed and burned major these past few months. I was always struggling something fierce since I was 14 (I have bipolar disorder) but about four months ago everything became particularly shit when I fell into psychosis. It was an intense, terrifying time. I got medicated for it and I know the meds saved my life but sometimes I think what for? They made me fat, tired, unmotivated, gave me bad acne, I lost my figure id worked so hard to maintain my whole life and my self worth spiralled. Being thin was always important to me to the point where I'd engage in ED behaviours. Even if I were to do my best now and get thin again I know it wouldn't be enough. I felt fat when I was thin. Imagine how I feel now at 15kg heavier.  I want to lose weight, but my shins are in agony every time I run (but I l love running) and there's no gym and pool close to where I am whatsoever. I feel hideous. Its awful. Every time I try to lose weight I immediately jump back into ED behaviour, I'm stuck.

I see a psychiatrist and I'm on a cocktail of meds. I feel like such an experiment, always needed tweaking and shit but never feeling any better. I sleep in till noon every day and go to sleep at 1am or later (talking to friends). I eat a fair bit of junk food even if I dont want it and am definitely eating more than I would've a few months ago. I can't talk to anyone in my life about how I really feel and a few times I feel like my psych has downplayed the severity of what I've told him (about depression and suicide). I think about suicide a lot. I've laid in bed and day dreamed about it. Walked around my neighbourhood and tested how strong the branches of the trees are and if it's hidden away enough for me to ""finish the job"" before someone notices. I just feel so ugly, worthless, lazy and stupid. It's hard for me to imagine a future where I'm really happy and I've had days I've thanked my lucky stars I dont live alone because I probably wouldn't be here anymore.

 I have no job because I have no way of getting there anymore (I can't drive and live country) and I worry about my rapidly depleting moving out funds that I use to fork out a shit ton on booze. I'll drink past the point of a comfortable buzz and make myself sick every time. I'll take my sleeping meds while I'm drunk just to experience that super heavy sleep. It's going to sound weird, but the other night before I drifted off to sleep, I'd had a shit ton to drink and took double the dose of my sleeping pills. My breathing was so slow as I drifted off I started to panic, but at the same time I couldn't really fight it or make myself breathe more and then I blacked out and woke up the next morning and I didn't think much of it. I dont care about myself.

What I do have going for me is I'm exactly halfway through writing the first draft of my novel I've wanted to publish since the dawn of time (even though I go days between working on it), I have two friends who really love me, even if they are very far away, siblings I would die for, if I stop buying so much beer I might be able to move out and I've kept going with university despite everything that's going on. Its taken me five years of study to reach my ""second year units"" because the mental health hell is this incredible overbearing struggle, but im still here. I did an intensive internship and scored a 87%. I got a 92% in a language course that's totally different to anything I've ever studied. I can be an excellent student, it's what I want to be, but bipolar has me on uneven ground and I'm either giving it my all or nothing at all. It's a year away, but I need to score amazingly high marks to get into the next leg of my uni journey next year and im already terrified I won't make it after all my hard work. If I fail to get good marks and get into my program, I might as well be dead.

I'm stuck, guys. I'd appreciate some help."

I am about two years out from finishing my degree, but I really want to be prepared to enter the job market and hopefully get an internship soon. I want to eventually go into cybersecurity, but right now I would take any job/ internship to help me get experience and knock my imposter syndrome down a peg. lol. I've been a student all my life and have only had a couple of retail jobs that each lasted a few months. So my experience in applying for jobs and interviews is almost null. I'm moving to southern Illinois in the summer and will begin job hunting then.

I guess I know where I want to get but now my question is how do I take my first step? What job with little to no experience needed should I apply for to begin my tech career?

Also, the overall location goal is to stay in the Midwest. Other than that, I can't think of anything other restrictions that would make me turn down a job offer initially.

Also, I am unsure of how to make a portfolio, or if I need one. I would definitely say I am ignorant of the hows to joining the tech industry. So if I missed something that you think I should know please let me know. I'm primarily a student, so I want to learn all that I can to make myself a stable future.

Also, I am not opposed to remote jobs but am not sure if taking that kind of job is wise this early in my career. Eventually, I would love to go hybrid, but I think I might learn more in-person/on-site right now.

Last thing I swear, where can I get certificates from? And which do you recommend for in general and cybersecurity? I know my resume is lacking but I at least know certificates are a pretty safe investment.

Any and all advice is welcome that will help me begin my CS/IT career.

Thank you."

So yeah it seems quite possible in getting a decent GPA in community college and participating in some extracurriculars.

But my overall high school GPA was pretty low (3.7ish), so I couldn't get accepted to top schools. 

My future career would be something about entrepreneurship/startup or at least business (consulting, IB), maybe in finance or economics. Major in business, finance, or economics possibly. 

I am not 100% satisfied with my top choice school I got accepted (Babson), which has great Entrepreneurship programs (#1 for entrepreneurship for 30 consecutive years?) but is not that prestigious in the finance market cause it is a non-target school. Being at a non-target school, I guess it is not impossible to go into top consulting firms/ib like Goldman or MBB but it will def. not be easy. And it is a small-scale heavily business-focused school, so I can't really expect active/perfect alumni networking or startup opportunities with other students who have tech knowledge.  

Of course, my dream is to build a successful startup but it's always good to have Plan B which is getting a job in a high-paying, prestigious company which would be much easier in target schools. It won't be easy to get a job at MBB or Goldman at top schools either but those top schools at least would make a lot of shortcuts. you know. At least I will get more opportunities and better networking there. 

As in startup, top schools' name prestige &amp; powerful networking could also help me to get more funding from investors. It will make things easier and faster. And I want to know which top schools actually provide lots of similar entrepreneurship opportunities such as venture acceleration programs, startup clubs, and connections with investors &amp; successful startup founders? 
(+Heard Standford and Berkeley have looooots of programs for entrepreneurs , do they actually produce a lot of successful entrepreneurs? 
I heard Berkeley is a BIG school so it might be difficult to do networking or join startup clubs that I want to go in
Tbh I really dont know which school I should choose 🥲)


But do transfer students actually get the same networking opportunities as freshmen students? Are there any disadvantages to joining clubs, programs, networking sessions, etc? I'm nervous about not getting great summer internships after transfer or just not getting enough access to clubs or programs related to my career path. 

I'm trying to participate in as many ECs while I'm in community college. Are there any ECs I could do to show my interest in startups? Is it possible to get summer internships or to get involved in startups? Btw I'm Asain with a US citizenship 

I just wanna get the best out of all the processes I'm going through. Want to be successful so bad

Whoa that was long! plz give me some advice guys! Thank you so much for reading"

A little background of myself. Currently a QA engineer in a tech company with around 2 years of experience (not yet but close to) . My dream is to shift to cybersecurity side and begin as a SOC analyst first.

I am interested in cyber security and currently studying CCNA and plans to study BTL 1 after learning more networking. I am curious and please suggest if I should apply for internship may be in IT support field right after i gain my CCNA? (given that I am relatively young, i work as QA right after graduation from university)

I am a little bit confused on whether apply for SOC entry role or an internship. (salary is not the first priority, as i am still in my entry level in my current job, the salary would not varies too much imo) 

thank you very much!"

What is your experience?,apagkio,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/u2mukt/it_is_super_difficult_to_enter_a_cs_program_and/,"I, all the time, read in reddit , stories about new grads or people with just a few years of experience getting positions in FAANG.

I have graduated from the top university of Greece with a CS degree. From my year, there is only one guy working for FAANG (Amazon)                                                                                                                          
He was a top student, that got an internship in Amazon during his Msc  (done in another top European university) and  was given a position there after the end of it. 

Similar stories for 3-4 more people that I know of (not from my year) that I had as TA's, and that's all: Top students during Bsc , FAANG internship during Msc  or Phd, offered full-time position.

And, to be honest, it makes sense. They have top grades, they have worked on interesting thesis, they have done internships. These companies receive hundreds of applications every day and they choose to interview the guys that stand out.

How on earth an average guy even gets an interview in this companies? It doesn't make sense. I tend to believe that many of the stories I read here are not real or that only top guys end up sharing their experiences.

Is your experience similar to mine?"

I am working under the same department. However, my advisor would just like to add another variable like temperature. However, I am thinking I would like to learn more - maybe try another cathode material like LFP or maybe learn more characterisation methods for the same project I did before.

So any suggestions regarding what I should do later would be nice considering that I would like to work for the industry if possible so what would be a good skill set to learn?

u2nvld,2,2022-04-13,Any opinions on first swe internship choice?,cilomaesar,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/u2nvld/any_opinions_on_first_swe_internship_choice/,"For a bit of context:

\- I'm in my first year as an undergraduate comp sci in the UK, and have received 2 offers now for software engineering internships

\- Both are within London and relatively close to eachother so I prefer neither in terms of location / distance

\- One of the offers is from arguably a significantly bigger company at this moment in time, and maybe more recognisable if I had it on my CV, while the other is a smaller company (from things I've read on glassdoor they're kind of progressing from a startup size to medium size right now)

\- I think I'm a little more interested in what the smaller company does they do (fintech/financial markets related), in comparison to the bigger company (media monitoring)

\- Both are offering about the same kind of salary (25-26k), so outside of what they do/brand name(?), the internships offer me the same thing

\- However, the slightly bigger company is also offering me a part-time role after the internship ends, so I'd do about 10 hours a week when I go back to university, which may (or may not be?) handy to keep on learning things from as I go

As a student who at this point of time is mainly just trying to get more things on their CV, should I be trying to go for a company thats better known, or does this not really matter at all? I'm probably a little more interested in applying to software roles next year which are involved with financial markets, so is it better for me to just go with what I prefer (smaller fintech company) and not care if a lot less people would have heard of it? I'm not sure if brand name outside of really big companies is even relevant to employers looking at CVs, but part of me is just a bit worried about taking the internship at the smaller company like I could be missing out on something

Any opinions appreciated, thank you"

u2pj9i,5,2022-04-13,Consequences from doing a 5th year?,Baculum-Deos,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/u2pj9i/consequences_from_doing_a_5th_year/,"Currently a sophomore turning junior and thinking about taking an extra year for a few reasons. 

Firstly, I’m planning on joining an rotc program, however at this point it would be too late to finish naturally being the end of my sophomore year. To get around this I would have to go to Boot Camp both this summer and next summer both being over a month long each. If I do this, I won’t have time to get any relevant work experience or internships for my degree, and am worried I won’t be competitive on the civilian side when I get out in 4-8 years. 

However, if I extend my degree plan by 1 year, I will not have an obligation to attend anything for the next 2 summers. This will free up plenty of time for me to get some good internships.

Another reason was because I’m interested in double majoring. While I can definitely do it within the next two years, my schedule is gonna be packed and be well over 15 credit hours each semester which, on top of rotc, may be a bit overwhelming. 

The biggest reason I’m hesitant to commit to five years is because I’m worried it’ll be a hard sell to employers. “Why would a liberal arts major take 5 years to finish their degree?” Especially when it could easily be done in 4.

Im afraid it just won’t look too pretty when I’m applying for my first couple jobs once I leave the military. What would the consequences be if I chose this route, or forgo the year and internships to finish in 4 years? Would it even matter when I leave the military? Thanks for reading"

Hey, y’all.
I have 2 SWE internship offers for this summer and am confused between them. 
With Schwab, I’m on the Customer Account Technology team, handling customer data and “modernizing using Java distributed micro services applications in a high volume and highly available environment.” 
With Visa, I am on the Network Processing team, and the recruiter described it as “the VIP performance and capacity planning team in Network Processing.  Basically, this boils down to making sure that we have enough processing capacity on the floor to handle the demands of processing the Billions of transactions that flow through the VisaNet system each year.”

For context, I’m currently a Sophomore CS+Econ student. Schwab pays more hourly but is only 9 weeks, so it’s less money overall than Visa, which pays less hourly but is 12 weeks long. They’re both hybrid (remote and in-person). 
I don’t particularly care about the money, just want to set myself up for a good intern offer next summer. My dad (also in software) has been pushing for Schwab, since the team works with data and cloud, and it’s a finance company so it should be good experience for other financial companies next year.

u2tz5i,0,2022-04-13,Grades in University,Aram256,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u2tz5i/grades_in_university/,"Hello,

I am currently a second-year cs major at UCLA. I have no background in coding prior to my start at UCLA. Most of the cs classes are pretty challenging for me since I have no background but I always try my best but I don't always do too well on some assignments and especially on timed tests. On the side, I have been creating some projects and have been taking extra online courses, and have received my first internship for the summer. Do companies really care about people's grades that much when hiring for jobs or do they care more about my experience in actual work/side projects? I've been told by other software engineers that they regret caring about their grades so much, is this true?"
u2umnz,2,2022-04-13,Swe internship?,decakid1,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u2umnz/swe_internship/,"Hey guys so I’m currently a freshman and I got a cybersecurity engineering internship for the summer. Even thought I like cybersecurity, ultimately I would like to go into software engineering. When looking for internships for next summer, will it be harder for me to find a swe internship because I’m doing one in cybersecurity this summer?"
u2uvi9,0,2022-04-13,What counts as a promotion?,AgeDesigns,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/u2uvi9/what_counts_as_a_promotion/,"I think I already know the answer here but figured I would ask to make sure.

I started with my current company as an intern after graduation from undergrad. I then got hired for a full time engineer 1 role. By the time I apply I will get promoted to engineer 2 at least, hopefully farther.

Worst case if I only make it to a level 2, would the “promotion” from intern to 1 count? Or would overall all the above be one promotion?

I should say too tried to find this info on here but reddit search sucks"
u2w3qr,4,2022-04-13,How long should I work as an intern?,kirti_7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u2w3qr/how_long_should_i_work_as_an_intern/,"I have started my first internship in Data Science, I sacrificed so many positions with good pay package for it, just because I wanted Data Science, it's been 2½ months working as an intern, the work was in little quantities when it began, so I was able to manage it properly, but nowadays, work has been crazy, I have logics to build, deadlines to meet, but I'm not getting ""actual code"" done, as most of time is going into the thinking part/building the logic part, it's been a lot of brainstorming and less actual result, but they want to see result, not my efforts, understandable by their part, but due to this my schedule has went haywire, I'm sitting in front of my PC 24*7 working on code, but ain't getting the results. The work excites me so much, but it has started irritating me a bit, and I don't want to hate my field as I have sacrificed a lot for this profile. 

So, how long should I work, it's wfh rn, but they may call me at office in the upcoming month, so I want to know how much hours should I work on my code/ on my internship? People say you need to work in office hours only, but due to this brainstorming I'm unable to do it in office hours, so I'm tempted to do it after hours too. Is it good? Is it bad? If it is bad, how can I improve myself?"

u2wxei,1,2022-04-13,Scared to take Adderall XR,yummybuttons,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u2wxei/scared_to_take_adderall_xr/,"Hello all! I just got diagnosed on Monday and was prescribed adderall xr today despite not even having the “medication” talk with the Dr. I paid $400 to take the TOVA, intentionally did bad and probably fudged the results because I felt like I was doing too well on it. Despite that I have been dealing with severe adhd symptoms for my whole life and have been doing CB therapy for now going on a year. I am scared to take medication and how it make impact my health and my personality as well as the side effects. I’m a bit overweight and have high cholesterol. I’m 23F 140lbs 4’11 for reference. I feel like if I take the meds I am giving up on myself since I haven’t worked out, ate healthy or journaled as a result of me being constantly busy. I’m taking 16 hours this semester and trying to balance a remote internship. I’ve been in school for now 6 years still in my undergrad. I have tried every trick and tip in the book. I am scared taking this could cause an mental break or take away the parts of myself that make me me. Can y’all give me your insights and experience with adderall XR?"

I'm a 2nd year BS Information Technology student and I'm highly interested in applying for dev internships. But I have no idea where to look lmao. Almost all the listings I see are either junior level jobs or unpaid internships for academic credit.

Are there specific companies or programs that offer paid internships in my field that you can recommend? This is voluntary btw. I really want the experience and really need the money hahaha.

Thank you!"

I am a recent graduate with a computing degree that incorporates elements of business understanding (broad areas covered include networks, data analytics, bash scripting, problem-solving, project management, entrepreneurship and python and SQL coding).

I spent a year of the course on an internship working with an automotive company in their supply chain management department, with an IT Intern title, working mainly with SCM applications and supporting them.

When I completed the degree, I joined full-time under an IT-SCM Analyst title and have worked at the company for around 11 months. My work has involved SCM application support and reports automation, with a sort of focus on data analytics (I know it may not be related to SCM, but coming from a technical background, they saw this as a good fit).

I recently received a job offer from a far larger automotive company to join their cybersecurity team for a significant raise vs what  I am currently on.

My current company, now aware of the offer, has offered me more money to beat the offer, but with SAP/Global Trade/SCM Analytics opportunities.

I sense that I enjoy problem-solving, and coding and would prefer an IT career path along those lines.

So my question is, which would the better career path be? From researching the two, cybersecurity looks like a rapidly growing field with high demand, both now and in the future. Global trade and SAP are also massive areas in their own right, but I don't think they align with what I want to do.

The current difference between the offers is around 10k Euro in favour of my current employer. But I have no doubt the other job role would match and surpass this within a few years.

Thanks in advance for the help! Sorry if this post isn't in the correct area."

The main issue is that there aren't any internships here in Cyprus, and all the Junior positions ask for 2-3 years of professional experience.

I don't know how to approach it. I figured it would be easier to find a remote position in the EU as there would be way more job openings. Is it even possible?

I considered Upwork as well, but I am struggling there too. I can't get invited to interviews for any job I apply to.

Am I better off focusing on Upwork, or should I apply to some remote internships in the EU? How do I even find these internships?

I guess I'm just trying to seek advice from those of you who have been in a similar situation, and what routes you recommend. IT is a crazy broad world that's easy to get lost in. I've been considering working towards getting a CompTIA A+ certification, but I really just need to find a way to get my foot in the door right now.

I am majoring in CS and wondering if a good paying job in CS (STEM) validates the debt I will have in  

 

1) The cost tradeoffs, like I have finally narrowed down between UMass Amherst Computer Science &amp; UIUC (CS + Advertisement)  But there's a cost diff of $21K EVERY YEAR. so is it preferable 

 (UMASS Amherst $41K v/s UIUC $62k) .  

2) how much does cost go down after having an apartment with utilities? 

3) do internships (cs major) help pay off much? How much would they save? Full year vs summer?

4) Can you waive out of any of the fees?

 Few other queries 

 CS + Advertisement comes under the college of media to be specific. 

Since it is a relatively newer program so there were not any stats available online  I wanted to check few things  

a) Being in the college of media will it hinder any of the foreseen benefits / or anything else in terms of getting co-ops or internships"

I am currently an undergraduate student in university, but due to some personal and family struggles I've decided to move back home to complete the remainder of my degree online (Exp. December 2023). My degree is going to be a BBA in accounting. After making this decision back in February, I saw a posting for an accounting internship with a cannabis company. I reached out to the job poster, explained my situation, and then after a two interviews they offered me the position. The only problem is that it was a 10-week unpaid internship. During my final interview the regional controller (my manager) said there *could* be an opportunity to extend the internship to a full-time position through the summer. With the exception of the unpaid aspect of it, I've loved the internship thus far. My coworkers are super nice and supportive, I am actually performing tasks at the job (not just fetching coffees), and the environment is super laid-back and casual. Also it's about a 10 minute drive from my house. Well, a few weeks ago the HR rep who recruited me began asking me if I would be interested in a bunch of different -non accounting- jobs within the company. Lab technicians, cultivators, trimmers, testers, etc. I said thank you for the opportunities but it wasn't really what I am looking for currently. My manager also came up to me and asked if the HR rep talked me about those positions. *I* took this as the manager and the company sort've deciding that they don't want to extend the internship. To be fair the office seems to be a bit overstaffed already and lots of the time there are one-two accountants sitting around doing nothing. I've worked my butt off and I'm proud of my work thus far so I really don't think it's a matter of me underperforming, I really do think it has to be with being overstaffed in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I made the assumption that they didn't want to extend and decided that I would just try applying to different positions and see where it takes me. Well I found an opportunity to work alongside an accountant at a smaller cannabis firm, I applied, interviewed yesterday, and today they offered me a position (they are working on the actual formal offer letter now). The position is full-time, paid, about 25-30 minutes away with the ability to work hybrid occasionally. The environment is similar in nature to the other cannabis firm (laid back, relaxed, office dog :) , etc etc). But, the staff at the company all seem to be much older than me, unlike the other firm. I'm okay with that, I have no problem making friends with people older than me, but still, it will likely consist of a bit of a transition for myself. It seems like a fantastic offer - I'm waiting on the formal offer letter now - but regardless it's going to be more money than I have ever seen personally (I've only ever worked part-time, minimum wage jobs through HS and college).  They issue is I think they were planning on starting me as soon as possible - but I do have 4 weeks remaining on my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldn't have just assumed that my internship wouldn't be extended, but I do think my assumption was fairly reasonable. I'm a broke college student with $3000 of personal debt and a whole lot more of academic debt. Part of me feels angry. My school actually wouldn't allow me to get academic credit for this internship because ""our students are too good to go unpaid"". And all of my friends who are interning are making 30-32 / hour at their positions. I work my butt off every day and it feels like I am not getting much in return, I'm grateful they don't just use me to fetch coffees and stuff but still I at times I'm doing nothing and other times I am doing my managers online CPA classes for her while she runs to the bathroom or eats lunch. So part of me thinks I owe it to them to tell them my plans, but the other part of me is just sort of upset. I get that's part of being a professional and now that I am making the transition from being a teenager to being a full-time working professional I am going to have to learn how to react in these situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my questions are what do you think I should do? I'm assuming I need to speak to the manager at my current unpaid internship and explain my situation. When I get the formal offer from this other company should I also tell them what's going on? I understand these conversations are best to have in person but of course I'm currently shaking with chills from the flu so that adds a further complication to things :/. What do you think I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Currently have 4 weeks left on an unpaid internship, received an offered for a full-time position from a different, but similar, company. Unpaid internship mentioned potential for an extension to my internship into full-time; however, haven't heard anything about that in 2-3 months. How should I handle this?"

I knew it was a big deal, especially for a 16-year old high school junior, but being the only option for internships within 50 miles from where I live, I wasn't surprised. This year they reached out to me again asking if I wanted to return for this following summer, and I of course said yes. As I am completing my associate's degree in computer science prior to the start of the internship, despite being a high school senior, they decided to let me do their college internship and casually told me that the hourly wage was $28/hour and that I was getting a $3,000 bonus that was subject to taxes. I didn't really think much of this at first but pass by a few weeks I talked to a couple of my friends about their summer jobs and I was seeing some TikToks, and I found out that people were comfortably raising families on hourly wages less than that of my summer internships. Like I'm making as much as some of my teachers are and they have master's degrees while I'm still in high school. I don't want to come off as cocky or bragging or anything but I just didn't realize the amount of money there was in CS up until now and I'm absolutely shocked at how much I'm making even before setting foot into college."

I've gotten a nearly perfect gpa so far, and my grades pretty much got me an internship. 

But this semester is insane. All of my classes are based on exams, and they all want to be at the same time.

I don't know yet, but it really looks like I'm getting a C in one class and probably a 1/2 B's. Should I drop the C? How bad is it? It's in Algorithm Analysis, which is related to my cs/engineering major.

My next two semesters are going to be 15hrs, so if I drop it, I don't know where it's gonna go. If I didn't drop it, I would still be set to graduate after eight semesters, which is great. But would I just take a semester of one class? That would be expensive and bad, but I could afford it. 

What will my employer think when they see my grades? Last they saw, I had something like a 3.95. I got straight A's the semester after they offered me an internship. If I get bad grades this semester, especially a C, maybe they'll think I stopped trying because they already accepted me. And even if I do drop it, they'll see that I dropped something.

The offer is contingent on that I have grades above a 3.0 in credit hours towards my degree. Do you think they mean for all semesters or just since they accepted me? Are they counting CS and MATH, or just CS? Since I did well last semester, even if they are only counting these ones I should be okay. But certainly all of my grades towards CS/engineering will be over 3.0 after this semester."

I’m currently a first year CS student at a lesser-known state school. I’m not really planning on applying to any internships this early, as I’ve only taken intro to Python and a general intro CS class. But I still look around at internships on Handshake and such out of curiosity. 

I noticed Amazon offers an internship titled “Jr. Software Dev Engineer” separate from their Summer internship program. Based on the description (linked in the post), it seems like it’s meant for 2nd and 3rd years, as the requirements aren’t too intense. 

I was wondering if anybody on here is in this program themselves, or knows some more details about it. Is the internship only a few-month program? Or is there opportunity to continue it throughout school and be offered a full time job? 

I’m thinking after this next school year, with some more advanced classes and projects under my belt I could have a shot at this. Just wondering if anybody has some more info on it. Thanks in advance!"

Have a marketing job lined up that pays less. Not sure if I should stay in tech or pivot to a marketing career. Need career advice. 

Hello! I’m a recent business grad who is almost 1 year into my first job out of school. I’m currently a project control officer for a larger tech consulting firm. Starting salary was $60K CAD plus health and dental. Got a 5% raise 6 months into my job and now making $63K plus a $2K bonus from referring someone, so $65K.

Anyways, I never wanted this job. I did an internship with this company for a similar role on another team. I only took this job because I was graduating during the pandemic, getting rejected everywhere, and was desperate for a job. An old colleague referred me. It’s a 2 year program, and the original plan was to finish the 2 years into this role then apply for something better. 

My first month was rough. There was a steep learning curve and my boss was unimpressed. She said that the other people she previously hired for this role were more skilled and I wasn’t up to their level. She kept implying I won’t pass my 3 month probation. I was for sure going to get fired, so I reached out to a friend who referred me to another telecom company new grad role he was doing. It was marketing related, and at the time paid $55K, so I didn’t mind a pay cut this early on in my career. I got hired, but it didn’t start until a year later.

However, I didn’t want to get fired in the mean time, so I worked hard to learn things on my own to improve. I turned things around, impressed my boss, and passed my probation. I still hated my job though and was eager to switch.

The problem is, that I’m now making $10K more than I would at the telecom company. They won’t match what I make right now. My friend recently left the company because he wasn’t liking the work he was doing and didn’t like the pay. Basically, it’s your typical useless intern work that no one wants to do. I’m now managing my own projects, so despite not liking my job, I do feel I’m gaining valuable experience. I don’t want to take a pay cut and do menial work at this point in my career.

My original goal was always to work in marketing but I had no luck. I finally got a marketing job. But working in tech, I got a raise much faster, and by the end of next year I’ll be touching $70K. In the marketing role it will take me the same time to even make what I am now. 

I want to pivot to a Business Analyst role, if not a Product Owner. Marketing careers, at least in Canada, are competitive, don’t pay very well, and it takes longer to climb that ladder. While in tech, salaries are higher, more chances to pivot or move up. 

I dunno. I’m lost. I have 6 weeks before my telecom job starts. Im tempted to just message them and say I got a better offer, sorry. But I also am not sure that maybe I am wrong about marketing and maybe it would pay better.

Any advice?"

Bago ako gumgraduate, naging Intern (at sa totoo lang hindi ko alam kung paano ako pumasa kasi alam ko sa sarili ko, I did so terrible with that job interview - not ready at all - hula ko pumasa ako dahil malapit lang ako sa area, high school achievements, at 'yung last question tungkol sa kaibigan ko) ako sa isang Government Office noong Dec 2018 to April 2019, parang assistant role iyon e, mag-aayos ng file, tatawagan 'yung mga myembro na magpasa ng requirements, o kaya magsagot ng call mula sa myembro, mag-stastock ng supplies kapag nawala na, assist minsan ang mga myembro kapag may inquiries, at mga iilang errand tasks galing sa mga regulars, so may experience ako sa office work.

Graduate ako ng BSIT noong May 2019, at nagsimulang magwork noong June 2019 (through recommendation or referral) sa isang logistics at nag-resign noong October 2019. Balak ko sana na mag-work sa BPO, kaso pinush ako ng Mama ko na mag-exam ng CSC, so ginawa ko, pero dahil nga nangyari ang pandemya, lahat ay na-cancel ang plano, syempre, hindi ako nag-iisa dito, marami din ang naapektuhan.

Sa totoo lang, gusto kong mag-sulat ng Nobela, maging may-akda tulad nung mga sikat na Wattpad Authors, pero dahil hindi in-demand ang pagiging may-akda sa panahon na ito o kaya sobrang hirap lumutang sa dinami-daming istorya na kalaban mo, ay baliwala maging isa.

Masasabi ko na may kaalaman ako sa pag-gamit ng laptop, Word, Excel, Google Docs, at Google Sheets dahil nagagamit ko iyon ngayon at sa dati kong work, 'yung dati kong work medyo similar s'ya sa encoder, pero may twist kasi - mag-uupdate ka ng report sa araw na iyon kung ilan na-deliver, tapos kapag may lagpas sa standard delivery time, kailangan macontact ang hub through skype (pero ang mahirap na part, minsan hindi pa nag-rerespond), at pagkatapos isesend mo sa companies na gumagamit ng logistics services. Pero dahil wala na akong laptop, hindi ko na magamit ang Word at Excel, kaya sa Google Docs o Sheets ako bumagsak. 

Kaya sinusubukan ko mag-apply sa Encoding Jobs kasi pakiramdam ko iyon ang pinaka-strong suit ko (kailangan lang ng refresher para magamit muli). At may part na gusto kong ma-experience maging Packer ng mga E-Commerce stuff tulad ng Shopee or Lazada items, pero wala akong experience dito. 

Kaso alam n'yo 'yung pakiramdam na kumakabog ang dibdib mo ng sobra kapag iyan na ang interview? Nanginginig ang buong katawan? Halos hindi mapakali, na kapag iyan na ang tawag, magiging blanko lang utak mo? Tinry mo i-adjust ang boses mo pero bakas ang nginig at kaba? Nag-practice ka ng mga sagot para sa mga tanong, pero minsan nakakatakot na hindi mo kontrolado ang mga ""unexpected"" na tanong? Parang pakiramdam mo na nabaliwala lang lahat ang practice mo? Pakiramdam na sa'yo ang mga mata na tatanungin sa'yo kung bakit sobrang laki ng unemployment gap mo? 'Yung pakiramdam na nay mas magaling na applicant sa'yo? Mga job descriptions na sobrang taas? Kailangan ko ba mag-English? (Masasabi ko na kaya ko mag-English, pero minsan blanko talaga kapag ayan na e) May problema na ba ako sa utak nito? Na-stestress out talaga ako sa job interviews...

OK ako, pero kapag iyan na ang tawag, halos wala na lahat ang nasa utak ko. Nawawalan na ako ng pag-asa at pakiramdam ko wala na akong kwenta sa pamilya ko (o kaya sa bansa) at iniisip ko lang ang sarili ko dahil sa sobrang takot ko sa job interviews. Hindi ko na alam kung saan ako tatakbo. Bakit ba kasi ang hina ng utak at puso ko? Hindi ko alam kung paano ko sisimulan ang lahat..."

I discovered that quant internships have a lot of hype in college and Jane Street is the only major firm that provides internships at my college (internships at Jane Streets are super hyped and highly competitive)


I had a few questions about quant trading internships

1)What should I do as a freshman to gain an edge in this race?

2)How important is my GPA in this process?

3) What's the role of competitive programming in this process( the seniors who bagged internships at Jane Street are proficient in competitive programming and have high rankings on various sites)

4) What books and guides should I use?

It would be awesome if someone with prior experience about this field can share their experiences.

Background:  
I am a Freshman with a decent amount of beginner programming info seeking a career in computer science/software development. I am currently almost done with AP Computer Science A and am near the top of my class, and I scored a 5 on the mock AP.

Goals:

\-Mainly building a strong college resume, fit with a portfolio and general knowledge of multiple languages

\-Starting a programming based club in my school to have a leadership role involving programming (but of course first I would need to be qualified)

\- Exploring all kinds of branches of programming like web development, mobile and desktop app development, maybe even game development, etc... to find which interests me the most and could be a potential career

\- Being able to possibly get internships in college

Courses/Languages I'm looking at:

\-The Odin Project seems like a good way to both learn many important concepts and aspects of web development, make projects, build a portfolio with it, so it seems like a strong contender

\-CS50 seems like a far better general computer science class than APCSA, and it seems to be recommended by the sub so it is also a possibility

\-I want to find some C# Course for both desktop app development and maybe even explore game development with Unity and build a portfolio with them

\-I am slightly iffy on mobile app development for right now as I do not have a Mac for writing Swift and a whole android app course seems very isolated from everything else (In the original post somebody suggested a Virtual Machine so it may still be on the table)

I am going to try and start over summer break after APs are over and continue from there, but my main questions are these:

\-Are the courses/languages I gave good for achieving the goals I outlined?

\-What is a realistic schedule or order of doing the course (Ex. CS50 over summer, halfway through that start Odin, etc...)? 

Any general advice is also much appreciated because I have no idea if anything I outlined is really viable."

Does a C in a major required course completely gatekeep me from admission?,marvelousdayz,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/u3a0id/trying_to_transfer_to_uci_for_cs_does_a_c_in_a/,"Hey everyone, I've heard you need a B in all major required courses to be considered for admission to CompSci at UCI. I, unfortunately, have one C.

Some background info, Basically, I went to a crappy community college and took Calculus 1 in Spring 2020, when the pandemic hit. The professor, unfortunately, left when we went online and told us we were on our own for the rest of the semester because he didn't hold the online teaching credentials. Unfortunately, I ended up getting a C in that course. Immediately after that, I transferred to Orange Coast College and now at the age of 25, this is still the only C I have received in college, In fact, I ended up getting A's in sequential math courses such as Calculus 2, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. I currently hold A's in every other major required course for UCI's Computer Science and my current GPA is 3.4 but can definitely get up to 3.7 by the time I plan on transferring in 2023. I have a software engineering internship lined up this summer and am currently working on a few big projects and have been getting active in hackathons. Will this help with admission at all? Is the C in Calculus 1 really that bad? Or could I even explain the situation?

TLDR: How bad is one C when trying to transfer for Computer Science at UCI?"

I am in a dilemma.,Leading-Camera-6806,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/u3caup/help_me_i_am_in_a_dilemma/,"After completing my studies (MBA),  I started preparing for UPSC. I gave the mains, but failed both times. Then I became upset and gave an exam of a govt. PSU that recruited me after I got a good AIR in it. I thought my life was set, with a very great CTC and high position. But I got posted to a grain procuring state in which there is monstrous amount of workload and it is not like a typical govt job.

After spending 6 months in this PSU (out of which 3 months was for training), I have become increasingly sad looking at the rough working culture and shoddy manner in which I have been treated here. 

I am handling 2 sections simultaneously, and have 3 officers to whom I have to report. On the other hand, the people who are reporting to me are all elder to me (some of them had joined the organisation when I was not even born), and despite my senior position in terms of hierarchy, I get pushed around and sometimes they behave rudely with me. I am a meek and polite guy, so this only exacerbates the problem. My reporting officers have also behaved rudely and threatened me at times that they will extend my probation, despite the fact that I am trying my best.

I wish to quit but I am feeling very scared and anxious at the same time. Except for a 4.5 month internship in company in Mumbai in 2016, I barely have any other work experience. I am 27 now, and if I leave this job, I do not know what I will do in life. If I stay on in this job, I feel that I shall soon die of a heart attack or something. Every morning I wake up with palpitations and a pounding heart. If I leave, I am feeling really anxious as to what I will do next in my life. 

I fear that I may end up losing my way in life's possibilities. What should I do...Would the private sector value my brief work ex in this PSU ? Is it too late to do an MS from Canada ? Heck I don't even know in which subject I should do an MS. Totally lost and depressed. I just want to attain peace of mind and lead a stable life. What I am going to do in life. I am being torn apart by conflicting emotions."

I hope it’s the place that I can post this question. Let me give you a brief info about my background.

I’ve studied economics and worked in international sales. After my gf got a job from a Swedish company we decided to move there. We will be there by August if everything went as we want. So I was thinking of learning software to change my career path.

During pandemic I learnt SQL but than didn’t develop myself. So now I started with python which I think easier than many languages. But what I am wondering is if I can get a job or not. I know that it depends on what and how much I learnt and etc. but what you guys think or recommend?

Honestly speaking, I think I can get a job as an intern or a junior. Especially after Covid the demand for developers increased rapidly. So I am not pessimistic about this idea. After python I am planning to learn JavaScript too.

Oh btw if those without degree could share their experiences I would be happy.

Anyway. I am waiting for your answers and valuable feedbacks!"

Thank you!,Juiceyboxed,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u3ji5p/finally_made_it_thank_you/,"Hey there, just wanted to express my gratitude to this reddit. Ive always lurked - which sincerely helped me in more ways I have words for. Just hear to share my success story so far!

(TLDR; made it to my first official sysadmin titled job in just 3 years!)

Started off loving computers since I was little, always technical - so began to believe that a compsci degree is the route i dreamed of - fast foward through college and i HATED most of it. Props to those who find that a great career! 

After 20 interviews in different types of jobs, ended up landing my first internship at an MSP - “helpdesk intern”.... needless to say i drank out of a firehouse considering the only real technical thing i knew was hardware and programming.

This was around $12 an hour for 4 months, hired full time after school was finished. I loved the work &amp; people... but the pay was yikes. Pulling 35k salary in NJ is..... basically broke. (1 year duration)

I ended up moving to NC during the pandemic, and landed an IT junior specialist job at a normal inhouse company. Again... 35k salary.. was just to get something after the move. (btw i loved it here, best decision of my life - even that salary got me by comfortable with my SO)

5 months later they laid of my coworker, took me off junior role and bumped my salary 30% (55). This was due to me grinding, learning, putting mysef out there, always having input or asking proper questions. It really helps to keep your people skills at a high level - leadership skills even more so. Regardless of the role, i found implementing leadership practices the main reason I was able to progress quickly... technical knowledge is iust that added plus.

Now once again - fast foward almost 2 years since i moved, I stopped learning at a fast pace. Work was slow, towards the end found myself with bad habits due to the teams work ethic and management. So, without hesitation - I grabbed a net+ cert &amp; bombarded employers with my resume.

I started at positions I was completely under qualified for. The goal was to increase my interview skills until i find a place I really fit. After my first round of applications (30 or so) - got nothing. So i sent the second, some interviews but no offers - send a third round (mind you this is about 2 months in)

And thats when magic struck! I went for my Sysadmin interview in a place I stopped being FULLY underqualified for. They were asking 6+ years of being a sysadmin (i technically had none, but worked on alot of similar systems) - overreached, crushed the interview... sent my offer - accepted.... and fell in love with the company, the staff, the enviornment, my manager... everything is amazing here.

It feels like I was living in the stone ages at my other companies with the various inefficient scripts, systems, technology, onboardings... etc. Its a breath of fresh air to be at a thriving company that is happy that im here, just as happy as I am to start! (fyi - another 30% pay bump, 75)

Sorry for the long story but hopefully it can inspire some youngsters to really grind out interviews and aim higher than you think capable.

I moved from a dead end msp paying 35k in the north east... which is scraps - to 75k, amazing company and enviornment, in an area thats roughly 30% less expensive for living costs in just 3 years. You bet your ass I wont stop here but hopefully I can pull a long term stay for once! 

Thanks for reading, let me know if you have any questions or need any advice im an open book. Thank you reddit!!"

I'm hoping someone on here can relate to what I'm going through or can share their experience in a way that can help me sort this out.

I was diagnosed with a speech impediment called ""semantic pragmatic language disorder"" since I was born. Links below if anyone is interested in knowing more about it...

http://www.mugsy.org/spd.htm

https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/slp/understanding-semantic-pragmatic-disorder

But for a simple definition, it affects my comprehension, and I had to have speech therapy. My comprehension is still a struggle even now, and I have always struggled in school when it came to word problems, physics, testing, and theoretical learning. 

Memorization is my key skill, and I excell at things like psychology, history, reading, and memorizing math formulas. 

After highschool, I graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering technology with a minor in manufacturing.

Since then, I have worked over 5 years in the field with some internships and two full time jobs.

I've had a good ""beginners"" understanding of what it's like to be an engineer in my field, but I feel like from my own experience, that this career isn't meant for me and now I'm trying to figure out what career I should go into.

I've learned that this filed is only constant high stress for me, and I feel like I don't make a difference compared to seeing how my coworkers do that are on the same job level as me. I also feel like this career I went into only plays on my weaknesses, rather than my strengths. I can also be a slow learner due to my disability.

From my research thus far, I'm planning to go back to school for online masters program in either possibly social work therapist, which I plan to have private practice with patients, or I also thought of maybe a speech language pathologist. I think either would be a good fit, but I'm still unsure and don't want to jump into another career if I'm going to struggle like I do now with my current job.

I do love working with people and helping, and have a lot of patience and compassion, so that's one of the reasons why I'm considering either one these fields.

Can somebody please advice on this or give your thoughts or experiences? I would appreciate any advice!

Hopefully this provides some context into my questions. If you would like more information, let me know!

I want to prioritize my free time over money for a period of time.

Some background: I quite recently got a PhD in audio for deep learning. After that, I did a year of internships in a few companies (one being prestigious) and two years as a full-time deep learning audio research engineer in a medium/large company.

I have limited expenses and could afford being laid off for a while but, instead of taking a sabbatical, I would prefer avoiding gaps in my CV and working for a small amount of hours, possibly using my skills in deep learning, audio, Python, patents etc. to get some part-time job, or as a freelancer, counsellor or similar.

It's a bit scary for me to leave my solid and growing full-time job, which it took a lot of efforts to get, but I am fed-up with my current life. I don't know what to expect from a temporary and unstable job (I worked in a retail store while at Uni, but that was for survival reasons), or if there is some other better option out there compared to those I mentioned.

At first, everything was great, I had a nice salary, good benefits and a nice work environment. Or so I thought.

I was hired in August 2021, around January this year I noticed a change in my coworkers behavior, they were being more rude and making inappropriate jokes more often. To put more context into this, I was the only female in the design team, everyone else is literally double my age. On my first day, one of them even commented on ""how pretty"" I was. Ew. I tolerated as much as I could, ignoring them, to make sure they didn't think that I ""fine"" with their jokes, but I guess their smooth brains didn't realize I was uncomfortable. Other employees from other teams noticed and even commented jokingly that they should stop being mean to me, of course they dismissed it.

Fast forward to February, my patience is running out, I'm months away from my graduation, I have trouble sleeping and my stress is through the roof. I start politely (but sternly) responding them, since I'm getting very irritated with them calling me insolent and bad mannered as a ""joke"", I always replied with: ""I'm not insolent"" and ""Why?"".

Oh yeah, let me say some of their bests ""jokes""! 

*clears throat*

""You got a good grade with that teacher you hate?  Didn't do him any ~favors?"" (This one made me visbly frown and ignore this mf for the rest of the day)

""You're taking take out lunch again? I pity your boyfriend"" (This was over a stupid ms teams call, it wasnt a meeting or anything, I got so mad I left)

At this point I had a panic attack just before I started to work. It was my first one, and since I had no idea what was going on, I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack and was going to die. I got sent back home drugged with some strong medicine they gave me and still tried to work (this was a home office day thankfully) since I wanted to be responsible or wathever. I talked to my therapist about this and we wrote this off as a one time thing and none of us thought much as to why it began just as I was about to start work.

March comes and they become even more rude to me, I naive as I was, asked honestly to one of them what was going on, he said that they were impatient with me because I was ""too stubborn"" and that I looked like I ""didnt give a damn about work"", EXCUSE ME???? This dude, had the balls to tell me this when one of our coworkers didn't come to work to go to a MUSIC SHOW! I obviously get very offended about this, hold my tears back as much as I can, since I don't want to show him that it got to me. When I get home I vent to my family and friends (which all agreed that he was an a-hole) about what happened and at this point I was already thinking of quitting, since I realized that: I was working my ass off at something that was only supposed to be a learning experience, I wasn't respected and what I did didn't get any recognition.

To make matters worse, I talked to a temp (that was a intern before in the company) and he said he basically cropped images, had a 30min break and sometimes even got out of work early! I was furious, since I only had a 15min break and did as much work as any other employee, except for less than half the pay. There were some events that I did EVERYTHING ALONE! And now I hear this old piece of shit telling me I wasn't doing enough??? DUDE I WAS DOING MORE THAN I SHOULD

My mental health was destroyed to the point I had anxiety attacks when I had to go to work, or even thought about work. My therapist tells me I'm burned out and should seek a psiquiatrist to get a 10 day leave. I do, and start taking medicine to take care of the damn anxiety attacks.

Then on the last day of my leave, I decided to talk to my boss. I tell her that I was quitting because of a bad work environment, disrespectful coworkers and feeling that my work wasn't getting any recognition. To my surprise, she's very understanding, says that it's a shame I was quitting, but sees where I'm coming from, since she recognizes that companies can be hostile to women, specially in higher positions and some people don't respect boundaries. She even talks about how she hears things that sound like we're in 1800 or something. Also says not to worry about references THANK GOD

Next day I sign all the paperwork, and never see them again. So long suckers.

I feel that I have learned a lot in my current position, and I am hoping to leverage my new experience with a potential new job.

Some new jobs that I am interested in require skills that I do not have. I recently saw an internship posting that I thought would be a good opportunity for me to learn skills on the job.

Specifically Python, GPS equipment, working for a large company with projects in different industries, Esri Model builder, digitizing maps, cartography and Survey123.   


Should I leave my full time position to take an internship where I will learn a lot? Are these good skills to have in the job description?

What skills should I look for in my next job? Do companies even consider someone with skills from certificates/courses rather than on the job experience?"

I'm currently working as a security analyst and am finishing my BS in cybersecurity this May. I was offered this job earlier this year, and my past experience was a couple of IT internships, so its an awesome opportunity.

So, my mentor/boss is taking an offer at another company. He is currently in the process of making sure everyone is set and ready to pick up some of his work while we work on getting some fresh talent in. He told me that he wanted me to take up more responsibility within the team, and that the CISO and other senior members agreed.  I'd effectively be the go-to guy or SME for all things related to our git environment, including tuning, migrating, and creating our automated queries that generate alerts. This was very surprising to me because its a sizeable part of our operation. Apparently I was trained specifically to fill this role, since this area is apparently lacking in the operation outside of my boss (and now, me). 

I'm quite genuinely floored about this. I am super excited to take up the responsibilities. Still dealing with the imposter syndrome but hey, aren't we all? 

Anyways, we both think this is an incredible opportunity for me, especially being this early in my career, and I want to make the most out of it. I've been doing a ton of outside learning, reading documentation, practicing regex, etc to make sure I can bring as much as possible to the table when he officially leaves. Beyond being prepared, what else should I do to make sure this is an invaluable experience for me? I really think it can be but I'm a bit overwhelmed at the prospect of it. Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

My profile :

1. GPA : 9.01/10 in a tier 2 college (top in Bangalore).
2. GRE : 322 ( 166Q, 156V)
3. TOEFL : 105
4. Papers : 4 - out of which 2 are published in international conferences, 1 in international journal, 1 in IEEE journal.
5. Internships : 4 internships (2 at top tech company and 2 at startups)
6. Work Experience : 1.5 year of experience at big tech
7. Additional Projects : 3 projects (all in ML related)
8. Extracurricular : Won many hackathons, Asia regionals in well known international hackathon.

My SOP was focussed on what I wanted to pursue during MS (related to data science) and my past projects along with customisation for each university. I had strong LORs from 2 professors and a tech lead. Overall I felt my application  was pretty strong.

I am lost and feel my energy is sucked out of me. I am trying to apply for the upcoming spring/fall cycles and I don't know what the universities are expecting. Or am I too dumb to attend their university ?

One factor which I think could have affected is GPA inflation due to covid and students taking tests from home and teachers being liberal. So scoring could have got lot easier and many people would have got more than 9 easily. If this is true, then the upcoming cycles are also gonna be tough. So I am not sure what to do. Should I just give up on my dreams? 

 I would love your thoughts.

2. Job prospects
3. Internship opportunities
4. Preparation for a career in CS
5. Networking

I also have some questions:
1. Does the overall reputation of a university affect job placement and networks more than major-specific rankings? For example, NU is #9 overall while GT is #38. On the other hand, CS rankings place GT at #5 and NU at #23.
2. Should location play a big role in my decision? I have heard that undergraduates end up working in the same area that they studied. Is this true.
3. How do companies view candidates from each one of these universities?

I should specify that I don't have a strong preference for any and think all three options present strong personal ""cool""ness factor that would get me passionate for them.

The unique pros and cons as I see it:

Research Pros: Most traditional ""strong"" EC, so if admissions are done in a formulaic manner, seeing research may add a lot of strength

Research Cons: Have to reach out to local professors; no guarantee that the research will be ready in time; AOs may know that many HS students involved in research are only involved at a basic level and may not weigh it that strongly; I will likely not be able to be published as a first-author; non-summer research may extend into the regular school year (?), eating up a lot of valuable senior-year time

Internship Pros: More commonly associated with CS than research as an EC; able to limit to summer-only; guaranteed to have something to show for myself

Internship Cons: I have to find a good internship in time; AOs may know that many HS students doing internships are only involved at a basic level and may not weigh it that strongly; I will likely not be able to be involved at a high level

Personal Project Pros: Most flexibility; I have a large amount of project ideas; most in line with current application theme (though, can change); strong addition to portfolio for post-graduation job search; the most nontraditional of the three, possibly getting a more ""wow"" reaction

Personal Project Cons: The most nontraditional of the three, possibly getting an unimpressed reaction; no guarantee of personal project success; may think that my projects were only due to familial support (which they won't be)

How would you rank these in terms of EC strength? Are any significantly better than the others?"

So, essentially, I want to dual major to make the best out of my experience in college. If I’m spending time, I may as well put in the most effort. What dual majors or minors will have the most yield or benefit for me in addition to CS?

The reason I aim to do computer science and biology is because I sort of want to have medical school as a “back up plan”, as absurd as that sounds. If CS just doesn’t click, and I don’t get well paying internships, I can always resort to applying for medical school with the knowledge I’ve attained from my biology (pre med) track. All the while, I think that my CS degree will help me stand out in a pool of medical school applicants and I presume that those skills will also enable me to find better research opportunities because labs are always in need of experienced coders. If I do end up going into CS, perhaps biotechnology will be a good fit for me."

&amp;#x200B;

I’m an undergraduate comp sci student (in Ontario) finishing my second last year of university with no personal side projects other than a few machine learning tutorials.

**Notable School projects I’ve worked on:**

* Game of Othello made with JavaFX
* Banking ATM application built around quality assurance using C++
* A conceptual mobile app, with conceptual design, functionality, and interaction
* A high school comp sci final project where I made a 2d “dungeon crawler” game in Unity where you navigated a randomly generated map to find a staircase, until you reach the boss.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of programming languages, I’ve worked mostly with Python, C++, C# (Unity), and Java (in no particular order), and currently I’m most knowledgeable in Python, as I’m taking a data mining course that uses it exclusively, and I’ve done a *couple* of python Leetcodes.

I have a lot of interest in machine learning and neural nets, although looking around it’ll be hard to get into without at least a master’s degree, and that won’t be possible since my GPA isn’t even high enough to be considered for one. I’ve also never been great with math, which is ironic considering I’m in comp sci, but I love solving problems even though I don’t actually do any problem solving for fun on the side either.

Of the coops / internships I’ve seen, they’re either web dev positions (which I have no skills in nor any desire to do web development), or positions that require knowledge I don’t have of loads of different applications.

Something to note, I’m going to be working over the summer in some capacity as I pay for my tuition myself, and won’t be able to afford it otherwise.

**Arts Portfolio**

From what I know, most colleges rate it on a 1-5 scale.

I submitted a violin supplemental portfolio to all schools that accepted it, and I would cautiously predict a 5 rating from most programs, perhaps aside from Harvard.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Chem Teacher (2/10): Really lukewarm, and it couldn't have been otherwise. I barely participated in zoom class, never talked to him one on one pretty much ever, and never spoke in class. Even when we went back to in-person classes. All things considered, I was frankly a ""bad"" student in this class.

English Teacher (7/10): This one I blame on distance learning. Did not participate much in class, however, I was one of the best writers and got 6/5 on all essays, and he would share mine as exemplar essays. We shared same sense of humor and our personality seemed similar.

Counselor (4/10): New counselor, talked to her once and only once, and that was for the rec letter. Very generic.

Mentor (8/10): I was able to read it, it was quite well-written and portrayed me as very qualified. However it wasn't very personal, and mostly academic.

**Interviews**

Had only 4 interviews. Apparently I opted out of Princeton and Duke interviews when I applied whoops.

HYSM interviews (6/10): All pretty standard, MIT interview went quite well (9/10) in my opinion.

**Essays**

Personal Statement (9/10): I'm a flowery writer. Talked about research, acne, and Mahler. I weaved the three very different subjects together in a refreshing way. A tad too academic, in my opinion, but there was definitely a good amount of personality throughout.

Supplemental (8/10): I recycled many of them, but they were still all quite good in my opinion.

**Decisions:**

**I ordered them by how much I wanted to go.**

*Acceptances:*

* **Duke** (haha.. I applied to the wrong school and even opted out of interview)
* UMN Twin Cities

*Waitlists:*

* UChicago (*too* quirky, I think I tried too hard to be quirky, and they probably noticed)
* WashU (grad school legacy)
* Caltech (very poor quality essays, total 30 minutes from scratch)
* Vanderbilt
* UCLA
* NYU (i felt pretty defeated after this one tbh.. coping by pretending it's yield protect.. haha..)

*Rejections:*

* Stanford (applied early on because of arts supplement deadline.. worst app by far, even had wrong personal statement)
* MIT (dream school since middle school tour. spent everything on these essays. they were, in layman's terms, beautiful. interview went really well, maybe 1.5 hours, and showed different sides of me. didn't matter i guess)
* Columbia (ED, super super super bad essays)
* UPenn
* Harvard
* Princeton
* Brown
* Yale
* Northwestern (My why northwestern was my best why us essay I wrote. Was really proud of it)
* Cornell
* UC Berkeley
* JHU
* USC (I'm content every other result, but this was still surprising to me. Expected at least a waitlist. Especially with the multiple acceptances of peers in my grade and in past years. Will note that none of my fellow cs majors made it in.)

**Advice (what I've learned):**

Don't waste your ED. Start your apps **early** or you run the risk of ruining your best chance.

I'm an advocate for shotgunning. I disagree strongly with people who say having more applications means you spread your time too thin and have lower quality apps. Barely heard of Duke at the time, only applied because it was high on the rankings. 

I believe essays (other than personal statement) are less important than your major/what ""new thing"" you will bring to the school. For Caltech and MIT your essays matter even less and your awards and achievements are above all.

From the collective experiences of my friends, volunteering really doesn't help college admissions, and you should volunteer only for things you genuinely enjoy. Leadership is not necessarily important, but a clear drive and dedication towards a passion is.

Also, **CS is tough.**

**Final Thoughts:**

I honestly believed that violin was a major part to my application, however I got flat rejected from, well, every school that had an arts supplement other than Duke. Personally, I believe the best to worst parts of my application was extracurriculars, essays, honors, arts portfolio, rec letters. The whole process of college applications was a nightmare for me. 

  
Feel free to pm me if you have questions about my violin portfolio. Or if you want to hear me rant about USC."

The first one I am interested in starts at a very typical cycle (begins last week of May and ends last week of August). The second starts later and ends later (mid-June to mid-September). I like them both but the first is more etched out for a ""proper"" summer given both the timelines and the guidelines for the project (the other project doesn't really have a termination at end of summer). 

For those that have had two more more offers for a summer internship but could only choose one, is there a successful strategy to negotiate a start in fall? For instance, would you try to let the hiring manager know or your recruiter? Do you mention anything about the competing offer or just disclose you already chose another offer?

I want to work as SWE or anything tech related but I haven't even started to take my coding classes yet. I'm taking the pic series next year. I have never learned coding before so I don't know what to put on my resume for now. I don't even have a single project. I've only been working part time and studying for my classes this entire freshman year and that's it.

I went to the career center once and a couple of career fairs. I'm just stressing out because I don't know what to do. Should I start applying for jobs after I learned some coding in pic 10A or what should I do now? My Handshake page is literally half finished and I just created a Linkedln account today. I don't know how I end up here but I'm stressing out and having a full blown existential crisis.

Hi Everyone reading this!! I am currently finishing my senior year and decided to not apply to college this year due to various personal reasons. Leaving that aside another major reason was not getting enough aid and I couldn’t convince my parents that an education in the US would give me enough aid. For my profile I am currently in a Swiss private school but my parents are gonna move back to India so my parents will experience a massive drop in income therefore they won’t be able to support me. 

I do A levels in School and have already received 4 A*s in Phy, Chem, Math and IPQ and will sit for my English and Bio exams this July and hopefully end up with 6 A*s. For ECs my major ones are Olympiads such as Swiss Pho where I was a semi finalist and ranked 38th and I am due to sit my Swiss Cho finals next week and I ranked 3rd in the semis. I was also the Student Body President where we also conducted volunteer work, Part of ETH Math Youth Club, Organised an International Photography Competiton and I work as a voluntary tutor in my school and part time private online tutor for Maths and Science. My minor ECs are varsity basketball and football as my school is quite small and we didn’t participate in a lot of games as we sometimes even couldn’t form a team. I also organised a Chess Club and helped in the yearbook. 

Now that you know my personal details could anyone please let me know where I could apply with these ECs and could I get a generous full ride covering living expenses maybe as well. I didn’t sit SATs due to Covid but I’ll sit for them soon now as restrictions have dropped. For my gap year I’m planning to enroll in a Bsc Physics College Course in an Indian Uni, and possibly try to get some internship and do some CS theory and online courses to help myself prepare for a uni if I get accepted. Thanks a lot everyone"
u3zyxh,2,2022-04-15,Is the University of New Mexico a good school?,Its-A-TA,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/u3zyxh/is_the_university_of_new_mexico_a_good_school/,"TL;DR - I'm worried about if attending my in-state school, the University of New Mexico, would limit any opportunities in the future or hurt my chances of getting into a great grad school.  I really want to go out-of-state but going to UNM would mean graduating debt-free.

I'm a New Mexico resident and I'm considering staying in-state to attend the University of New Mexico, but I'm wary about how great of an education I'll get, how serious the professors are, and what/how many opportunities would be available.

The only reason I'm considering UNM is due to the fact that I was admitted into the Honor's College and I'd be attending tuition-free and graduate with no debt.  However, I'm very worried about the ""prestige"" or the reputation/recognizability of the school, with it being one of the lower-ranked state schools, and also whether I'd be truly challenged or engaged there.

To give more info about UNM, they are a R1 Public Research University and their best programs are medicine, law, and engineering, however I'm not planning on going into any of these fields since I'm majoring in psychology because they didn't have neuroscience as an option for undergrad (which is another slight problem for me.)  The school has a 96% acceptance rate and a 48% graduation rate (which is pretty horrible compared to almost all of the schools mentioned here lol), but this is due to the fact that their main priority is providing a college education to any New Mexican who wants to earn a degree, and we are a very poor state with a horribly underfunded education system.

I've heard from many friends and people I know that the classes there aren't rigorous or challenging at all, the professors don't care too much, and the students don't put a lot of effort in.  I'm also very concerned about what research/internship/mentorship opportunities would be available to me there, and how valuable they'll actually be in the long-run.  I'm also not a big fan of the environment and campus of the school either, and hate the location and the fact that most of the people from my high school are going there.  They also have a very lackluster alumni.

Would going to a middling state school like UNM hurt my chances of getting into a much more renowned or rigorous grad school such as UCSF, an Ivy, or a T20?  Or hurt my chances when applying to jobs, internships, or any career opportunities in the future, especially if I was planning to move somewhere else after undergrad?  I'm considering going out-of-state for the reasons above, and also due to the fact that I absolutely hate living here in Albuquerque and really feel the need to ""start over"" somewhere new, but I'm not sure if taking on the debt is worth it.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

I’m honestly scared out my ass right now. My depression this last year has been tough, but I was able to scrape by last semester. On top of all of that, I had a horrible housing situation that effectively left me homeless for my whole first term and the 1.5 months of my second term.

I need to be taking at least 12 credits a term but I desperately want to withdraw from a class that I know i’m going to fail. that puts me below the limit. my choices are fail my class, fuck my GPA and get put on academic probation or withdraw from the class, save my GPA but get out under the minimum credit requirement and get put on academic probation.

My biggest concern honestly, is having my parents notified. I have a horrible relationship with them that i’ve never been given the chance to heal from. I’ve been lying to them all semester that I’m doing alright simply out of fear of the constant snide comments and control they would try to exert if I did open up to them (this has happened before when I opened up to them about my depression in high school). I literally have no idea what i’m going to do. i’m going to be put on academic probation at an expensive college that my parents are paying for because I couldn’t just get my ass up and go to class and do my work. 

I had plans to go see my friends for a couple days before I started my internship, but I know that that’s not going to happen anymore because i’m on probation. consequences of your own actions really does kick you ass.

any advice for how to even begin to approach this with my parents?"

I was fortunate enough to receive an admit from NYU Courant for MS CS. I am excited at the prospect, but as someone who is going to complete his undergrad this year, I'd be moving to the US with no work experience. Some people I have spoken to have said that having no work experience would put me at quite a disadvantage when it comes to getting internships after my 1st year or jobs once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get more opinions on this, if anyone could talk about NYU in particular, that would be great, but I'm curious about the market as a whole and how big of a disadvantage having no work experience is. I ask because I have a good job offer in hand here at home (India) and could potentially get some work experience and apply again later. However, I am a little apprehensive to do so because the process if gruelling and there is no guarantee I'll get admits again next year - there's a chance Fall '23 could be even more competitive, right?"

Right now they're using excel to host all of their skill matrices, and graphs associated to it, which they store on their Onedrive. But it comes with many downsides (hard to maintain, real time modification depends on the drive and there's a low data coherence as people tend to work with the excel offline and only then )

I thought about using a database but they don't have any deployed right now (even though we're a 200+ people agency, they could really use one IMO), I think I'd lean more towards a non relationnal database considering how inconsistent the data is... a schema would be too hard to handle here but I don't really know which non relationnal database would be better.

As for the visualisation of all that data we have a PowerBI pro license, but again, I don't know if using that PowerBI is the best way to visualize data or if I should directly create a web application with a some graph framework on top of it... 

I'm open to help, suggestions and fresh ideas here! Tell me if you need any clarification as well"

Found out this week that it came down to me and another candidate for my dream job, and they decided to go with the other candidate due to them being older with more experience (29-year-old second-career grad student v. me, a 22-year-old undergrad student-teacher). I honestly can't even be mad, I know the other person that they hired and they were a great choice--to even be compared and considered neck-and-neck in caliber with that person is a huge honor to me, but I'm still just so ***SAD***.

The same day as getting rejected from my top job choice, I got rejected by two others for not having enough experience, and by another for being, and I quote, ""Overqualified and under-experienced"" ????? I am about to graduate from undergrad and I am feeling defeated.  I did everything I was told that I should do in order to get a job, especially to land my dream one that I just got rejected from. I did all these internships, add-on licenses, and extracurriculars,  and I am graduating with distinction in the field in my content area, and also receiving leadership honors and Latin honors. I practically drove myself into the ground during my final semester in order to be seen as a top candidate and land a job somewhere, but my resume is getting tossed when they see my age! It's hard to feel proud of myself right now when everything I have been working towards seems to not be falling into place for me no matter how hard I try. How can I get experience when no one will give me a chance? :/"
u4a364,3,2022-04-15,How to forgive someone who is not sorry?,Electronic-Score1576,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u4a364/how_to_forgive_someone_who_is_not_sorry/,"  Name changed for anonymity’s sake.

A few weeks ago, my best friend Tania and I talked about how trauma changes people. She said her partner's trauma made him stronger, but I remain weak-willed despite trauma because I'm privileged and sheltered.

It felt very dismissive and invalidating. This is not the first time Tania’s said something like this. I don’t do well with confrontation, so I ignored it.

Recently, I vented to her about my internship. I was told at the end of the internship that I could either get a permanent contract or leave. However, they offered to extend my internship instead, stating that they couldn't make me permanent, but with no further explanation. I was upset; it felt insulting, especially since it's a 9 to 5 for minimum wage.

This job has taken a lot from me, often at the expense of my health and postgraduate studies. Many have commented that I am one of the hardest workers there. My co-worker is supposed to share several responsibilities with me at my job, but he does them half-heartedly, so I do them on my own. 

Tania said sometimes God gives people the ingredients they need, but they want the finished product. She told me I'm very privileged again.

I told her it's about the known exploitative nature of this company, privilege has nothing to do with the situation at hand. She said, 'all components matter.' I told her it doesn't in this case, it's about them wanting to keep me but not pay more.

I got irritated because whenever I vent to her, she constantly brings up. I told her this and she got very clipped and defensive, telling me to point out where she did that. When I did, she said 'OK but are we talking about that now? Or are you grouping me in with what other people say about you?'

I wanted to tell her the only people who say this are her and my aunt. Everyone gives my aunt a pass because her son (also my best friend) died, but she is toxic and manipulative. I was empathetic for years, but she became incredibly cruel to me.

She saw my father beat me within an inch of my life. She told my mother to kick him out because of what he did to me. Yet she’s beaten me up many times, including the time I was on my way to the hospital because I tried to take my life at 15.

At 14, she started forcing me to drink with her, which turned into an addiction that I still struggle with a decade later. She also said I enjoyed being sexually assaulted since it was more than once.

To this day she calls me spoiled and says I have no reason to be depressed. 

Even though Tania is aware of this, she constantly says it, and it strikes deep. I told Tania I know what to do about this, I just need a few minutes to be upset about this before dealing with it. I told her I just wanted a friend; I didn't want a solution. Then she said ‘OK, do that, feel better soon.’ That was the last time we spoke.

I'm not good at making friends or socializing because I tend to take things at face value. Most of the time I can’t read between the lines or pick up on social cues. When a situation has certain undertones, I don’t realize until someone tells me. I’m told I’m too quiet. I don’t like most things people my age do, like clubbing, I get overwhelmed and anxious with the loud noise and flashing lights.

When I’m with my friends, I always make sure I act in a way considered socially normal. I mimic what the group does. When I get home, I'm so exhausted and I just self-isolate for hours to recharge.

I don't want to lose Tania. However, clearly she views me as a spoiled brat with no reason to be depressed since, in her eyes, I didn't have it that bad. I know she meant it and isn't sorry since it isn't a one-time thing.

Honestly, I'm not sure if i'll vent to her again because now I know what she thinks of me and it's not going to disappear just like that. Can this be fixed? How do you forgive someone who is not sorry?"

u4aiqa,6,2022-04-15,Too many tabs in my mental browser,The-Psych0naut,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u4aiqa/too_many_tabs_in_my_mental_browser/,"So recently my life has been getting a bit complicated and there’s just a lot going on right now. I’m struggling and could use some support or advice. 

It feels like when you have several windows with 30+ tabs open on your browser, and are simultaneously running 8 word docs and 4 excel sheets in the background. 

See I’ve been living at home since graduation in 2020, and have yet to get my career started. The job market hasn’t been great for the industry I want to get into until recently. 

At first I was juggling interpersonal conflicts with my dad’s SO, applying to jobs, keeping the house spotless, caring for pets, &amp; getting to work on time. It wasn’t super overwhelming but it was constant. 

Now it’s gotten better but also worse. 

With career prospects I’ve got an internship starting in May (3 days/week, $16/hr, first 10hr unpaid; moving to 5 days/week in June with possible pay raise, and potential for permanent position in the future).

I also have a gig job I’ve been working for awhile as a brand ambassador, I’m a contractor. 

In addition to this I have another gig related to the field I want a career in, which will be sending me to Vegas for around a week in early May (internship is cool with this). 

So now I’ve got to figure out how to build my regular work schedule around this, at &gt;$15 it’s not enough to live on but I definitely can’t afford to quit &amp; rely on working 3 days/week over an entire month. 

In addition to this my grandparents health is failing them, so I’ve also got that on my mind. And I’ve been trying to date, while also continuing my job search for something better than an internship at the entry level. 

I’ve also been working on getting a new psychiatrist (which I did, yay) but still need to set up with a new therapist too, preferably an ADHD specialist. So I’ve got that I have to work on. 

Add to all of this the fact that my dad wants me to also start getting apartment research done (I can’t afford anything above a slum with current income), and start vetting potential roommates. He doesn’t think I’ve made enough progress on the job front and he’s right that I could be doing more, should be doing more. His theory is that if I have my own place I’ll be more inclined to get those things done. Domestic chores I think he’s right on the money, but my career stuff? I’m honestly not sure. 

I haven’t taken a day to do nothing in around 2 months now, and taken my medication every day since I need it to function and actually get stuff done. Needless to say I’m exhausted. I can’t slow down without feeling bad/guilty/lazy though as my day to day always leaves a couple hours to unwind before bed, and I also get distracted by small projects which set me back on the stuff I’m meant to be doing. 

So yeah, I think my computer brain is reaching RAM capacity and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed by everything on my plate now. And idk what I can do about it since I need a career settled by the time I’m 26 in December."

I'm a self-taught software engineer with a degree in mechanical engineering. I've recently starting focusing my job search on German companies and I've been reading a lot on the rules there. I'm confident I can land at least a few interviews but my concern is with the visa process.

Is it possible for me to get a blue card to work as a software engineer when my degree is in mechanical engineering? Also, I don't have much professional experience as a software engineer; just an internship and a portfolio of different projects, but I've read some success stories of people moving to Germany with not much experience so I'm hoping that would happen to me too.

Thank you!"

What I’m struggling with is trying to convey my experience with computers without implying expertise. For example, I’ve got a lot of adjacent experience coding in various languages, but not to the point where I would claim to be proficient in any. Dabbled with SQL and some DBMS in school and an intern position. Disassembled and reassembled old laptops and desktops, converted old drives into external storage, some small half-finished projects stalled by lack of funds for necessary hardware, etc.

Recommendations for building a resume focus on specifics, so I guess what I’m saying is that I have very little to imply technological literacy despite having a decent degree from spending so much time reading about and playing around with tech. I specifically studied for the A+ for perspective on the layers of abstraction from metal to compilers, and learned a heck of a lot on that account.

Or maybe the cert and an AS in science with a focus on programming already implies it? Does it even matter for entry level positions?"

I have a BS in Math and an MS in Applied Statistics (graduated Dec. 2021). I have applied to many data scientist roles and am usually having some interview or complete rejection. I was so close in the final round in a case study for an Associate Data Scientist role where the interviewer spoke so highly of me and my work prior to presenting only to hear rejection.

I have only done one Data Science experience and acted as a consultant in graduate school, but that was it. I had a Business Analytics internship but felt unsatisfied from the very little math/stats and programming. I also had two research experiences involving statistical distribution theory and data analysis (not sure if that counts as professional experience).

I have tried networking with the career counselling center, professors, and others at my internship, but I am having no luck. I am trying to learn more Python as I go along (I have 4.5 years of experience in R and nearly 1 year of SQL experience), and also plan to take the Microsoft Data Analytics Associate certification (to prove my credibility and knowledge) and more soon.

I can include my resume here for anyone to help me and/or give any thoughts/insights. I began to realize that I would love to pursue careers highly focused in Python programming and modeling. Thank you all in advance!"

Math undergrad, Info Systems/Analytics masters.  It's impossible to cross over from the administrative department to the analytics/IT department despite my knowledge of report writing, calculations, and data points.

So, I've been trying elsewhere.   I took an internship with the Red Cross using Power BI for experience in my spare time on top of my job.  But when I went to a Python meetup group, the people I talked to immediately labelled me as non-profit.

I just had an interview with a recruiter for a BI developer position in finance, which although I know SQL and Tableau he wouldn't push me forward because I didn't know Azure Data Factory, then he recommends a position in non-profit.

Are you pigeonholed into an industry once you take a job?  I'm 43, I don't have time to make a mistake.  Yes, if I have spare time I like to donate it to helping others, but I have to worry about my survival first.  Should I take the internship off of my resume to avoid this type of generalization?

I am a veteran currently attending school full-time as a junior majoring in Pharmaceutical and Healthcare marketing. Being a veteran, I feel impatient with my life as I’m 24 years old and want to “start my life” with a full-time job with a salary receiving a reasonable income and acquire a house.

While in school, I was gifted the opportunity of doing a full-time internship at a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company doing indirect sourcing. Indirect sourcing is basically everything outside the actual pharmaceutical part working on projects like diverse reports and saving the company money with LinkedIn , etc. When my internship ended and returning back to campus, my boss offered me to stay part-time while in school, which I happily agreed to in order to have a foot in the door with the company. 

While I’m happy to have a “guaranteed” employment once I graduated with my sourcing team as my boss stated, I find my job completely dull. Even though it’s refreshing knowing I won’t be concerned about employment after graduation, I can’t see my self wanting to stay doing this for the rest of my life.

I saw an opportunity for a sales internship which I believe I I’ll enjoy a lot more. However, I fear holding off my graduation until later and may lose my seat with my current team if I wish to transfer over. This sales job is also with the company.

-should I pursue another internship within the company and push off graduation? 

- stay safe and stick with my current part time position? 

-if I choose to stay with my current position, will there be an opportunity to transfer over to sales with no experience in the pharmaceutical industry?"

What should I do,LookRevolutionary198,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u4hn98/my_past_came_back_bringing_troubles_what_should_i/,"So, when I broke up with my girlfriend of five years had quite a man whore phase now, one of those girls is back in my life asking me to sleep with her ,even when she knows I’m in a contented relationship with a girl.

Her response was well i have no problem with it cause being a side chick works for me all I want is you to fuck me twice-thrice week , to this I strongly denied her cause can’t I cant cheat.

Now this girl know me since high school and she threaten to tell my girlfriend some secrets about me from back in the day and how many people I’ve slept with.

In 2016 I bullied a lot of kids at school in my high
school I use to sleep around a lot before getting
into a serious relationship my body count is close
to 30 at 19, but nothing could topple the fact that i
had an affair with my maths teacher while i was in a relationship with my girlfriend.

This  has potential to ignite trust issues between us cause I work informally for my professors although most of them are men and PHD pursuing students in research and publications so this could either cost me a good internship cum job paying me around $800 a month or a relationship.

She said a man whore like you is bound to cheat and can’t be trusted upon, so why don’t you just fuck me and we will be good."
u4idsd,1,2022-04-15,Need a Plan: Going back to school for CS major,maekyosity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u4idsd/need_a_plan_going_back_to_school_for_cs_major/,"Hi all! I'm 21F and I'm going back to community college for computer science. I'm making a 180 degree career pivot from mortgage sales. I'm a very plan-oriented person so I came up with a general rough draft of what I need to be doing/focusing on. I just don't know the specifics and I don't know if it'll be efficient. This is where I'm asking for help. Please look over my game plan and let me know if you have any suggestions! I know absolutely nothing about this industry other than what I read on Reddit.

Notes: I pay my own bills/rent so I absolutely need to be working this entire time. Currently I have an interview lined up as a bike shop tech, but would love any opportunities that'd look good on my future resume.

Ultimate goal: FAANG, of course!

Step 1:

Working towards transfer. I already have my GEs out of the way and the only thing that will take the most time is the consecutive math courses I'll have to take before I can transfer. I go to a California CC so I'm using [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) as a marker of which classes I should take. I should be done next summer. I'm considering schools out of state too just because I really wanted to live in Seattle/Oregon and it'd suck if this threw a wrench in those plans. I've even considered moving before I finish my transfer classes??

What can I do during this period? My guess so far: coding bootcamps, Google Analytics course, leetcode. Would any companies hire me as an intern before I even transfer??

Any specific things I should focus on during this period?

Step 2:

Transfer and get bachelors. During this time is when I assume bigger companies hire interns. I hear side projects are really important too so I'd like to focus on that. I'd also be sharpening up my resume and doing whatever it takes to graduate with a stellar resume.

Question is what exactly does that take? Github? More bootcamps? Personal projects?

Step 3:

Graduate. At this point, fingers crossed, I'll have a decent resume with some work experience and projects thrown in there. I'm guessing I'll get a chance as a SWE at any company, work there for a bit, and prepare for FAANG interviews in the meantime by studying leetcode and DA (is that what you call it?).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, this is my overarching plan. It's huge and daunting. I just don't know specifically what I should be working on. Specific bootcamps? Programs? Internships? All I know about is that Google Analytics certificate course. I don't even know what stack overflow or Github is...

Thank you, thank you if you've read this far. And thank you even more in advance if you have any input. I'm so green and so ready to make a career pivot!! I can't wait to look back on this post in a few years in (hopefully positive) nostalgia :')"

I'm a 3rd-year undergrad student at the moment, and I've been sure that I've wanted to go into this field for the last few years. Recently, however, I've been having doubts. I've read around here that you have to genuinely like this field in order to stick with it—being interested in learning new tech, doing personal projects, etc—but I can't relate to any of these. While I do enjoy coding, I realize I do NOT want to do more tech in my free time. School in itself is enough and I'm a bit lazy as well, which doesn't help at all. But despite generally putting minimal effort into everything career-wise, I'm objectively doing okay. I go to a decent school and get decent grades. I have landed a few internships over the past few years, but realistically, I've treated them more as paid vacations. My question is if I am basically screwed once I actually start working? My past managers have given mostly positive feedback, and have offered full-time roles after I graduate, but I know people are generally just very nice to interns. I'm looking for advice/stories from everyone more experienced here since I am genuinely scared that my slacking will eventually catch up."

After thoughts:
*Answering a question I was asked-*
How do you choose between two Ivies(specifically Princeton and Columbia?

Major specific courses, general fit (no, I’m not a prick), and amount of opportunities. Princeton’s Public Policy(SPIA) major is some globally top-ranked stuff, and I’ve been wanting to major in something Soc/PolSci/Econ/Comms related (a lot I know). The SPIA major is literally the perfect combination of all those fields. As far as general fit, the campus is fucking gorgeous. I want a campus environment for undergrad because I want to feel sort of centralized in a community while still having close proximity to large urban cities. Columbia is in the heart of Manhattan, but it’s campus is so small that it doesn’t have the home campus vibe that I’m personally looking for. And Princeton is only an hour drive from NYC and Philly. Columbia has a ton of opportunities due to location. But Princeton’s undergrad focus allows it to give a ton of funding for students pursuing internships. And every class is taught by actual PhDs so there will be great letters of rec opportunities.

Edit: Did this on my phone. Hope it isn’t formatted poorly."
u4k692,2,2022-04-15,Internship workload,FirstOrderCoder,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u4k692/internship_workload/,"Hello all, a little info on myself before I pose my questions. I just started my senior year in January and last October, I joined a start-up company as their first comp-sci intern. They have expressed in my quarterly review that they assumed I would be more knowledgeable with data acquisition instruments, processing large data sets, etc. I let them know that aside from still being a student 😂 my university went fully virtual (started uni right when pandemic hit) and education was crummy so I tried my best to be self-taught with zero prior exposure to code before 2020.

So they’ve been kind/patient with me and recently, they've assigned me my first project that is very large and very important. Essentially, my scripts will calibrate 2 of their patented devices. These devices imitate short circuits in large vessels to ensure that their systems don't completely fail. I don't get much assistance from because they wear multiple hats w/ few employees and they don't know how to mentor a comp-sci intern (they're all power engineers) just yet.

While I am extremely grateful for the opportunity and I enjoy going to work, I feel overwhelmed by this large project. Especially since they've expressed urgency for it and that my project would cut part of their testing time from 4 days to an hour. I'm nervous to disappoint them/lose my internship but at the same time, I'm doing the best I can with minimal hand holding.

The questions I want to ask is to put things into perspective for myself are: 

* For those who have interned at start-ups, what was your workload like &amp; did your mentors often guide you?
* For those who have interned at larger companies, what was your workload like &amp; how were your mentors like?"

u4ld1g,18,2022-04-15,Is network+ and web pentreation testing enough to land an entry job as a pentreation tester ?,Ramseesthe4th,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/u4ld1g/is_network_and_web_pentreation_testing_enough_to/,"So I finally networked with one guy who works as a manager for a cyber secruity team ,he is one of the best in my country ,a geeky guy who is very familliar with pretty much everything . Under him he has many teams for mobile,iot ,web,and others . He told me that I should have sold knowledge of networks and web , and practise hacking challenges mainly on web pentreation testing ,and machines on hackthebox . I asked him if i should focus on reverse engineering,exploit development . He told me many stuff on that , first is that it requires many understanding on OS, architecure,and compilter theory ,second is that there aren't many jobs in them except in hardware hacking and IOT . But if i want to practise reverse engineering challenges besides Web that is fine . 


The problem is that i feel if things didn't work out with him in the end,because I can't work now because i have to go the military for 1 year ,i am afraid that when i contact him again he will forget me or there will be no positions for me . And that other tech companies will require more knowledge and skills . 

So basically I started these days learning more hardware , started with Digital logic design and plan on moving to microprossores later and microcontrollers . I didn't take Physics or electronics before,or on other words I took them but failed . I failed computer engineering school and transfered to Bussiness infromatics and information technology due to having bad anxiety and panic attacks during exams ,and my professsors weren't that great . 

So I am learning hardware besides hackthebox hacking practise everyday,and I am also doing a technical support internship for firewalls and cloud security , i feel all of these will be too much for me and I will have a burnout and that I will not master web pentreation testing which is for now is the most important technique i should focus on ! What should i do ? I have many things in mind



I ordered Ben Eater 's kit for the 650 computer because I plan on assembling a computer on my freetime as a hobby to know more about os,assembly,and architecure . 

1- I plan on studying digital logic design for 1-2 hours everyday . And if i find anything that I don’t understand i go back to it in physics books . 


2-Focus on exploit development prerequiste in r/exploitdev : C,ASSEMBLY,REGISTERS,AND that is it no need for digital logic design or electronics for now .


3- Just focus on web penetration testing and mastering it since i am an intermediate now ,and read more writeups about bypassing WAF  protection, the internship i am learning Sophos so i might try linking them together . And from time to time i solve a reverse challenge and learn about C and assembly.  Prove my skills through bug bounty and ctfs and screw certificates and acadmics. 

The first 2 will drain me ,at least in the beginning. The 3 is the most suitable,but if i didn’t learn hardware now i am afraid that recruiters will see me a script kiddie or an amateur cuz I didn’t go to engineering school and study hardware like the rest of students. I have an arduino uno and made some projects with it with leds and sensors. I am a big believer in practicing and that computer science is a knowledge that can be acquired from anywhere. 

What should i do?  The guy is super great and i hope to work with him in the future but nothing is reassured."
u4lvi7,1,2022-04-15,How do I deal with living far from my parents as an adult?,upstatechild,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u4lvi7/how_do_i_deal_with_living_far_from_my_parents_as/," I (F23) have been mostly living away from home since I was 18 and started college. I went to college across the state (5 hour drive) and came home for breaks and such. I had a super smooth transition from living at home to being away at college.

About 3 years ago my parents moved to another state and it became significantly more challenging and expensive to see them often. I then received an internship in the same state as my college which I was able to turn into a full time job. I had a hard time accepting the job offer even though it was a dream job for some and amazing pay because I hated the idea of being so far away from my parents. (I am an only child of immigrant parents for context with no other family in the country). Covid hit right before I was about to graduate and I ended up moving back home from March 2020-May 2021. I loved living/working at home and being near my parents. In May 2021 I was forced to go back to the office and have about a 12 hour drive/2 hour flight away from them. My parents have also had a hard time recently financially and things have just been rough and unstable for all of us.

I decided to go back to school this year and applied to a number of PhD programs. I got accepted into a number of places but my top choice ended up being a university near where my parents live. They agreed I would move back home and live with them while I did the PhD. I was super excited and it's a great college town and I thought I would be happy.

This morning I woke up to a university that had previously rejected me asking me to join their program (yes I guess this does happen). It's a much more prestigious program and university and I ended up accepting the offer and reneging on the other school near my parents. I know it's for the best but I have not been able to stop crying and am having hysterics to the point where I can't breathe.

I feel like I should be more independent from my parents at this age but I feel like I'm breaking my own heart by moving away from them. Has anyone gone through the same thing or have any types for how to cope with this?"

One of my professors emails me and asks if I am still on the job search. I reply that I am and in about a week I end up meeting the guy who would be my boss for the next year and a half. The pay was modest at $20/hour.

The internship turned into a full time position giving my resume a big boost and making college much more affordable. Now, 2 years have passed since I have worked there but I honestly don't think I would be as successful or have had as many opportunities post college as I would have if I hadn't taken it upon myself to network with people at my college. Opportunities are everywhere, you just need to know where to look. A little bit of luck too ;)

I had to retake 2k2 so that also has me a bit behind schedule for classes. This is what I have in my schedule for the next two semesters so far.

**Fall 2022: 14 credits**

* ECE 301: Signals and Systems - 3 credits
* ECE 302: Probabilistic Methods in Electrical and Computer Engineering - 3 credits
* ECE 337: ASIC Design Laboratory - 2 credits
* ECE 39595: Object-Oriented Programming in C++ - 3 credits

* ECE 437: Computer Design and Prototyping - 4 credits
* ECE 477: Digital Systems Sr Project - 4 credits
* ECE 49401: Professional Comm Capstone - 1 credit

I know that 337 takes up a longass time for labs, but I really want to take 437. So those two classes are some that I definitely want to do.

I also am not super sure what I should do for senior design. 477 seems fun, but time consuming and especially with 437 it seems like it could be a hellish semester. So I was thinking of maybe taking the EPICS version to split it over two semesters.

I was thinking that maybe it would be better to take 301 and/or 302 over the summer. But I also don't want to spend money on summer classes unless I think it would extremely help me.

I also still need BIOL 110, but was thinking of taking the CLEP exam to get out of it.

Any help and advice would be really appreciated :)

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I’ll be doing a summer internship too. So that’s another reason as to why I’m hesitant on taking summer classes"

u4tzos,3,2022-04-16,Medicine or Computer Science?,NoMarket8584,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/u4tzos/medicine_or_computer_science/,"Hi. Sorry if this is the wrong place.

I’m an HS senior who is currently trying to decide between the two. 

I genuinely don’t have any passions and just want advice… what’s a better career worth pursuing?

Here is how I see it: 
Computer Science is a high risk, high reward type of field. Not only is it highly competitive, you do not have any job security. You could go months not figuring out why you aren’t being employed or getting an internship. You need to spend a lot of time in undergrad doing things like projects and finding internships (finding internships seems like it’d be quite hard to do especially if you have little experience). For the next several months, I am going to work on my coding skills and try to land an internship over the fall. But again, that’s where I see a lot of iffiness. Am I going to be able to land internships? If I work decently hard, will I be able to land a 150k+ paying job out of undergrad? In five to ten years from now, could I safely say that my salary will have doubled to a comfortable 300k-range?

Money isn’t everything, but its just these types of things that come to mind first. CS also has the pleasure of providing you with practical skills to do what you want to do, like starting a company or website potentially out of your own free time.

Medicine:

I feel like it comes from a place of privilege to say this, but I believe that if I start early and just study hard enough, then medicine will be a straightforward path. I’ll probably try to land several jobs as a volunteer over the summers, some basic ECs, and some decent research with the coding skills I do have atm. Medicine is about slaving off the next 12 years for a guaranteed reward and I’m just not sure if it’s worth it.


All in all, as someone who did relatively well in HS, I know that I will be able to work extremely hard in undergrad. It’s just a matter of risk. for CS, if I don’t motivate myself at all to pursue projects and such in my free time, then I’m screwed.

Some back ground

He was diagnosed and treated for ADD early on. He has always needed some nudging along to accomplish things, but has done great in school so we always chalked it up as normal adolescents . He earned 2 associates degrees while in high school as well as graduating with Honors. 

In his senior year things went south, we were working on pulling back some to get him ready to manage things on his own in college. This did not go so well and he nearly failed out of some of his classes his senior year. We franticly were searching for some help for him prior to sending him away to college. Through online research we learned about Executive Dysfunction. We found him a therapist that he enjoyed working with that specialized in ED. Things seemed to be improving ever so slowly and he managed to finish high school without failing out but not with as good of grades as he was surely capable of.

Sending him away to college now had even more hurdles than most deal with. He was still meeting his therapist online regularly but the first semester was a disaster. We struggled so much trying to help him from long distance and everything he struggled with was spot on for ED. We talked with his therapist and she explained she was not getting any follow through from him at all and nothing she was suggesting was being carried out. We just were not seeing any progress at all. After many talks and the expensive bills of nearly $1000 a month that were not covered by insurance we decided to stop with the therapist. 

The struggles continued and even worsened at times. Some classes were failed and needed to be retaken the second half of his freshman year, and now we are at the tail end of his first year and the struggles continue. He is likely going to fail or nearly fail at least 2 classes again.

He has an internship lined up at home for the summer, has a new girlfriend he met at college and wants nothing more than to return after the summer. We have talked many times about possibly not sending him back after the summer. As parents we are struggling with sending him back and setting him up for failure without having any way of helping him.

We know that if we keep him home he will be so angry with us and most likely resent us, and honestly he will be 20 when it's time to return and we can't really stop him, but how can we send him back knowing he truly can't do it? It's like letting your child swim in the lake knowing he can't swim and you can't give him a life preserver, you just have to cross your fingers and hope he figures it out and doesn't drown.

It's not that he doesn't have the knowledge he just can't get past all the struggles that ED impose.

We have tried plans, apps, weekly FaceTime meetings with him, a daily routine for him to follow, we have tried everything that we have found out there in an attempt to help him succeed and be independent and nothing has worked. And on top of it all, the process is very embarrassing for him and triggers his social anxiety. He tries to hide it from his girlfriend and friends and that is just compounding things.

So here we are, he is doing his best to study for finals this week, is on track to fail at least 2 classes that he is now taking for the second time if he doesn't do well on the finals, and we don't know what to do. There is tons of info out there on how to help toddlers and younger children with this, but not much out there to tell you how to help an adult. It's like his ED keeps him from being able to address his ED. It's such a viscous cycle.

As parents we are having such a hard time knowing where the line is that defines what he can control, and is just being lazy or choosing not to do, and the other side where he truly, honestly, can't help it. As a parent it's hard to understand that he can't help it and telling him to try harder doesn't do a thing for him, but at the same time you can't just sit back and accept it as how it's going to be. We see the frustration on his face and can tell that he wants so bad to be able to do this but just can't seem to get ahold of it. It's sad to watch and we just don't know what to do. We keep reading that things should improve as he ages but we aren't seeing it yet. At this point I honestly don't know how he will manage in life on his own.....holding a job, taking care of a family and a house, just remembering, and following through with daily tasks doesn't seem like anything he will be able to do.

His mom and I are so stressed over this. We even find ourselves arguing with each other over it and its just taking a huge toll on all involved.

Are there any resources out there that can help with adult ED? Any advice that may help? Anyone that has successfully worked through this? We just want so bad for him to stop struggling and live a some what normal, independent life. 

I know this got long winded and if you made it this far thanks for taking the time to read it.

u4w5bd,1,2022-04-16,I’m under qualified but got a interview for internship,Environmental_Sir_43,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/u4w5bd/im_under_qualified_but_got_a_interview_for/,"I’ve spent some parts of college dabbling a bit in cybersecurity but never anything serious. I recently applied for a position that my friend recommended and was told after reviewing my application they wanted to ask me a couple of questions. Things like graduation date and if I’m okay with the pay, etc. After that I was sent a coding assessment(basic python), I completed it and was later emailed a few days later that they’d like to move forward after seeing my results and will set up an interview once their scheduling is arranged. I honestly don’t know how I made it this far in the process granted that I didn’t expect anything from the position in the first place. I’m their qualifications page I noticed that it says “Former experience or internship in Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, Penetration Testing, or Red Team is valuable” and like I said earlier I did a little cyber security but nothing actually substantial. I also don’t meet the preferred GPA requirement. This makes me feel unqualified and I don’t see myself being taken seriously as a candidate. It doesn’t help that I was just reject for a job I was extremely qualified for, my confidence right is really low and I just want a better way to approach this."
u4ymvo,6,2022-04-16,Would this employment history look bad to an admissions committee?,plainbread11,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/u4ymvo/would_this_employment_history_look_bad_to_an/,"To keep this brief, I’m pretty paranoid right now and just need some objective outside opinions. 

I had a variety of internships in college (startups, corp. strategy, analytics etc.) before graduating in December 2020 and working at a F100 CPG company in their rotational program immediately afterwards. I went through both phases of their program (Jan-Oct.) but have always been set on startups, so I left to join a Series A company in October. 

Now I’ve been at this company for around 6-7 months and my manager has this review coming up. I’ve not received any negative feedback until like 2-3 weeks ago, when all of a sudden she comes out with comments about my deliverables to date. She sent me an email saying that I’m not meeting expectations and has a roadmap of what I need to apparently do to get there. Performance will be assessed after 4 weeks. I’m not sure what happens after 4 weeks…

If the worst happens 4 weeks from now, how would this look to prospective employers and Adcoms? I don’t believe I’m a bad employee— I work hard and put effort— I just moved from company 1 to pursue startups, and may leave company 2 because of a mismatch between my manager and I. 

Any advice helps!"
u4yqlo,1307,2022-04-16,"Just started first Software Engineer job at 85k salary, graduated in 2021 with Associate’s degree, didn’t meet all of the “requirements” in job listing",DBaack11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u4yqlo/just_started_first_software_engineer_job_at_85k/,"With the title, I’m not trying to come off as boastful about my new job but rather, I’m wanting to write a post that would’ve been helpful to see during my school/CS journey.

I initially attended a state school for a year studying CS but then transferred to a community college once COVID hit to pursue a new CS pathway they were providing. I was excited about what I was learning but I was worried that just an associate’s degree wouldn’t be enough to land a good first job, especially with all of the “requirements” in entry level job listings that I did not meet. 

Then in September of 2021, I started an internship that I got through the new pathway provided by my CC and I graduated shortly after in December. I then started applying for software developer/engineer jobs at the beginning of 2022. 

I found this job that dealt with languages and technologies I was familiar with but the requirements were a Bachelor’s degree, 2-3 years of professional experience, and all that typical stuff. Fortunately, I was requested for an interview, advanced to multiple rounds, got to showcase my take home assessment project, and received a call later that day that they’d like to offer me the position! 

I wanted to write this post for anybody who is doubting their degree, pathway, or capabilities to not get discouraged by job “requirements” and go for opportunities that speak to you! 

**You can accomplish more than you think you can. You’ll never fully be prepared for something, so just go for it and give it your best effort.** 

Whether you are stuck in tutorial hell before starting a project or hesitant about a job opportunity, just go for it. All that matters is that you are able to produce a solid solution when given a problem.

I am super grateful for this opportunity and for all of the help/advice from this sub! Thank you for reading and I hope this reaches who it needs to!"
u50162,819,2022-04-16,I just got my dream job in IT that had sliped though my hands because of this subreddit. Thanks guys!,gnotaur,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u50162/i_just_got_my_dream_job_in_it_that_had_sliped/,"As the title says. A while back I missed a really good job offer but was offered 2 more weeks of internship.. You can see the full story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/t85ht2/i_just_had_my_dream_job_in_it_slip_though_my/). And many of you gave me amazing advice on what to do and how to behave in a professional manner.   


Amazing advices that I took with me those 2 weeks on that second part of my internship. And one week in I got reoffered the job. And an apology for the way my case was handled it was basically a manager and HR misunderstanding..  
   
they needed 3 hires in total and they had already hired 3 before I was even in the picture but one of the new hires lived in London and had some paper issues working in another country. And my manager was 100% sure that he wouldn't make the third deadline (already missed 2 and they where often in contact) and therefore I would get the job.   
  

that's why it was offered at first but HR noticed that we had surpassed the headcount and therefore had to ""take back the offer"" but in the end everything worked out and I'm glad I didn't make a fool of myself by behaving sour or being mad or smth!   


Monday starts my third week there and it's amazing. First job I actually enjoy!


Soo thanks again everyone!

u50ne0,0,2022-04-16,Advice about class/internship that wasn’t so great,danicius,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/u50ne0/advice_about_classinternship_that_wasnt_so_great/,"So I took this course called IDS4940 I saw on my canvas page that it’s being promoted as Active Learning Program, I only did it for the internship aspect since they wanted computer science majors, long story short the intership did not correlate to my major at all and I had to pay for this class that all it talked about was sustainability…the class isn’t bad but at the this point it’s gets old learning the same thing over and over again, I thought it would more profesional development or at least help getting more internships in the future but turns out to be a bad experience. My internship with my research team was halted, and the only project of the class was to do a poster about our research work but now cannot do due to ethical reasons. Truly just wanted to do that poster board session because at least I did something meaningful for a class I didn’t enjoy but now I cannot. Is there a way to complain about this class? It basically took my money for an internship that wasn’t worth it. Like Is emailing the ombudsman worth it in this case?"
u51k1k,2,2022-04-16,Is it worth paying ~40k a year to go here? (prospective L&amp;S CS Major),[deleted],berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u51k1k/is_it_worth_paying_40k_a_year_to_go_here/,"I just wanted to get your guys’ thoughts. I’m an international student so cost of attendance per year is about 70k but I’m getting a 30k/year scholarship so it averages out to about 40k over 4 (maybe 3? Because apparently you can grad CS in 3) years. My parents will be covering the costs of attending using their savings, so I won’t be getting into student debt. I’ve always wanted to go to Berkeley.

My other option is going to the University of British Columbia in Canada. I got into their commerce program for a double major in Business + CS. Here, I will be paying about $4k ish a year. Maybe a little more if i don’t get housing after first year. Most people I know get into UBC (and are going) but everyone at my school got rejected from Berkeley. My cousin is also at UBC (2nd year) and is struggling to get an internship. Do most Cal students get an internship in 2nd year?

As students of Berkeley, I wanted to know if it is worth, in your opinion, to go to Berkeley over my other choice. I got really excited when I got into Cal (was my top choice for a while) and I won’t be in student debt but I can’t help but think whether saving my parents’ $160k and maybe investing it would be a better option. Really at a crossroads here lol"

My major is media and communication studies, and in my industry, a graduate degree isn’t very necessary so I’m not planning on getting one as of now. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros: 
- I’d be able to graduate with my boyfriend and follow him to grad school
- My leftover college savings would go to my brother and he’d be able use it (money is not a major issue for either of us)
- I technically hold a part time job in my industry so I already have that on my resume
- finding a second major would likely mean I’d have to cram a lot of credits in only two semesters so graduating early would save me this hassle

Cons:
- I’ve gotten major fomo in the past and I’m the only person in my friend group not in the class of 2024, so I’m scared they’re gonna have fun without me.
- I put a lot of pressure on myself to make the most of the college experience and I’d have even less time to do that
- I only have one internship on my resume that I had to drop earlier than expected 
- I don’t have any leadership positions on campus and wouldn’t have time to get any
- I’ll likely graduate with a 3.5 ish GPA (pro?) and idk how this will affect my chances at getting a full time job after graduation

Any insight helps! Thanks in advance"
u53ni6,3,2022-04-16,Need help deciding what to do this summer! (STEM T10 vs City of Hope),rosamundpie,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/u53ni6/need_help_deciding_what_to_do_this_summer_stem/,"Summer program application season is finally done and after submitting what felt like 100 applications to as many places as possible because I am \~insecure\~ I've gotten a few acceptances, a few rejections, and a lot of choices to make.

For some background, I intend on applying as a biochem major and being a premed, money/transportation/housing is not an issue (I mean, obviously it will be practically but don't judge based on that since my parents said they would help me make it work either way), and I live in California.  I am currently deciding between continuing research at a T20/T10 for STEM (trying to be vague but I feel like it'll be easy to figure out what T20 it is lol) or participating in a paid biomedical research internship at the City of Hope (a big hospital/cancer research center)

Option 1:  Continue research at the T20/T10

\- I've been volunteering here for the past year, and I did a science fair project that did relatively well (qualified for CSEF so that was pretty cool) 

\- I've gotten to know my advisor pretty well (and he also went to my high school lol odd coincidence) + he wrote my rec letter for the City of Hope.  I was hoping to also ask him for a rec letter for college and for Regeneron STS, and that would obviously be much better if I did a summer project at the lab.

\- The research I'm working on is definitely biochem, but it's not as applicable/interesting as what I could work on at the City of Hope.

\- Not paid 

\- More flexible -- I can go on more vacations, work on/build a community service project/organization I started this year (that I may have overfundraised for and now have money that I should use otherwise I'm kinda breaking grant promises heh), and do some other summer programs I had applied for (Girls Who Code SIP, an internship with a publication, Iowa Young Writer's Studio)

\- I was originally going to write something about \~prestige\~ but tbh I'm not sure.  The university is very well known and even my parents are impressed (lol not me using them as a standard since they're Asian 😭)....but I feel like AO's/future employers may think that I got it through connections and not merit?  But at the same time I have a decently strong resume...idk

\- If I stay, I could (maybe?) go more in-depth rather than learning new stuff and not having as much time to do intense research at the City of Hope (?) -- I don't have a lot of info about the city of hope, though, so maybe don't judge off of this

Option 2:  Go to the City of Hope (Eugene and Ruth Roberts Summer Student Academy)

\- Superficially...prestige.  The program is really selective (like 4%), and it's paid ($4000 stipend) + at a well-known cancer research center + college students do it too.  So like...paid biomedical research internship sounds pretty good on anything...

\- $4000 -- my parents said don't worry about the money (ahh I really don't want to sound entitled but I think this is how it's going to end up sounding -- I just want to say I recognize how incredibly privileged I am and I'm really grateful that my parents worked hard and were successful enough to let me be in this position) but that's not exactly nothing yk 

\- It's 10 weeks, and you can't go part-time.  I haven't traveled in the last five years due to medical issues, then the pandemic, and I'm not sure if they'll let us take a week off (especially since it's paid...), and my family had wanted to take a vacation this summer

\- Very intense.  Not sure of the exact hours, but I get the feeling it's a Mon-Friday 9-5 sort of thing.  I wouldn't do anything else major with my summer, since I wouldn't have time -- I wouldn't be able to work on the community service project I had been working on most of my junior year, which I've actually really enjoyed doing (and I guess would be good for college apps lol I hate how I'm a prestige whore) --&gt; I would be able to do Iowa Young Writer's studio though since it's mostly asynchronous

\- The research is more up my alley.  Not to say that what I've been researching the past year is not enriching and enjoyable, but my brother had cancer and being able to intern at the city of hope and help out researchers who are looking for cures/explanations for cancer would be amazing

\- I'm planning on applying to some BS/MD programs so this could help show my interest in medicine (I haven't been able to volunteer at a hospital and I don't do HOSA or any medicine related clubs)

\- Diversity in experiences:  I'm interested in learning more outside of the very specific field I'm studying rn + it would be cool to do cancer research...and the time to explore is now lol since I'm young and fresh to the world of academia 

\- If I do this, I feel like I'm kinda betraying the other lab I worked in?  And like obviously the rec letter shouldn't be controlling my decision but then it wouldn't be as good if I asked my mentor to write me one after I kinda ditched him for a summer 😭

&amp;#x200B;

Okkkk anyways if nobody responds I think writing it out still helped me think more and in the end I know they're both incredible opportunities so there's no ""wrong"" choice -- thanks for reading through this entire rambling post!!"

I’m curious in general as to overall opinions on how these two compare for TC and especially pace of career growth. I’d rather try to get an internship at one of them junior year and do a return offer so if there’s an obviously better choice it’ll influence that (I’m interning at Amazon this summer).

Other things like WLB I’m aware of already but I’ve heard conflicting things for the above categories."

And i went in and saw this older guy maybe late 40s and i thought he was just this macho guy since he was talking a lot to this younger girl who was before me. But once i went in, he was asking me a lot of sincere questions which led to me talking about my work and how i like focusing my art on mental health. and he asks why mental health. i was like well i struggle a lot with it. and he said “me too… diagnosed with bipolar. i haven’t had a depressive episode in years though”. he asked me what diagnosis i had but i said i didn’t really have one, just suffered with anxiety and depression, go to therapy and on meds and stuff. 

once we were done, he said something along the lines of “it’ll be okay, you’ll get there.” this interaction was just so different and meaningful. i am quite shy and don’t handle conversation well, so i wish i had talked to him more. the appointment went by so quick. 

i guess if you can take away anything from my story is that you are not alone. you maybe feel like you’re the only one struggling, but there are people all around you that understand what you’re going through and believe in you. people that you least expect."

\- no tech experience, not too much on my resume

\- havent visited a single career fair, dont know which focus in EE i want to do specifically yet

\- not in a project club or anything worth putting on my resume

What were ways that you guys landed your first internship with 0 to little experience? What websites did you use to apply? I feel kind of lost knowing that I'm kind of behind. I was considering MASA but I didnt find it to be interesting enough. I just want to land something either this summer (probably too late, i applied on time to SURE but i got ghosted) or this fall. 

It doesn't have to be an internship, but I just need some experience on my hands. Reaching out to professors seems intimidating since i dont have much to offer"

**Additional Information:**

Reflections:

\- I applied to 6 reaches, got into 0 (honestly thought Northeastern was a target but that's clearly not true this year). I didn't apply to any true targets. Accepted to all of my safeties. I never truly expected to get into a reach, but I always felt a hope for it. I'll probably attend IU or Purdue in the fall. Rice is honestly my dream school, but I can't have any expectations of getting off the waitlist.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I think the biggest issue with my application was the lack of rigor in my schedule. I only took 2 APs before senior year when most top students from my school already took at least 4. I dealt with a lot of anxiety during this time and underestimated my ability to handle a bigger workload. Looking back, this is probably my biggest regret. Beyond obviously not pursuing more prestigious ECs/awards, I think I should have spent more time really letting my personality shine in my essays. While it could have been unrelated, I truly think that my Rice supplements showed more about who I was as a person and this could have been why it was my only reach I wasn't rejected from."

I graduated from university in June 2021. Unfortunately, I didn't push myself to get an internship during my undergraduate years.

I kind of slacked off until probably October/November 2021. I applied to a good amount of jobs and eventually, I landed a virtual on-site but failed to get the job. I felt really demotivated and stopped applying until February.

I am now as motivated as ever to get a job as an entry-level software developer. What are the most necessary things in order for me to get a job? Would working on one big project be the best idea? I am currently working on taking a full Web Developer class on Udemy by Colt Steele to both learn and brush up on material in order to work on projects. I also plan to start reading *Cracking the Coding Interview* as soon as possible.

Also, would taking a job as an IT count as relevant experience? I currently have a small part-time in the food industry to just make it by for now."

I'm a final year computer science graduate. I was supposed to have a placement year but as a result of covid there was almost nothing suitable.

Now I keep hearing people saying stuff like ""graduates without experience won't get anywhere"", ""a computer science degree is a waste of time"", etc and it's starting to wear me out. I've come so far over the last 3 years, my code is so much cleaner, I now understand and use version control, I pick up new languages and frameworks much quicker, and stackoverflow no longer scares me. 😏

I've reached out to some people who have been on internships / placements who say this kind of thing and asked ""specifically, what experience did you gain from this that university didn't teach?"", to which the answer is generally ""uh, AWS"".

Ok, so I've enrolled on a beginners AWS course. I have a dissertation project where I built a web app allowing for defining and analysing trading strategies with spring boot and react, which I will be able to discuss and demonstrate with employers.

What else can I possibly do to give myself am advantage? Or am I just overreacting to what people have said?"

In the future, I'm not sure what exactly I want to do but I know I want to go into data analytics/IT (definitely wanna go where the money is as well). I'm having a hard time seeing where each offer could lead when I graduate. Here are the offers:

**Offer #1** (in-person, large company)**:**

* Analyzing large databases in order to generate new information/reporting for the team.
* Supporting forecasting of receivables and fees.
* Assisting with reconciliation of detailed credit card data processing.
* Learning internal point-of-sales systems, as well as external systems that support the team’s reconciliation processes.
* Performing daily reconciliation, data entry, and data mining to the process of finding anomalies, patterns, and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes/exceptions, and actions to fix variances.
* Performing other duties as assigned.

**Offer #2** (remote, small company)**:**

* Assist with standardizing connections between Enterprise Applications
* Unit Testing of Boomi iPaaS integrations
* Collaboration with different departments to gather requirements, confirm data, and troubleshoot integration issues
* Support Master Data Management implementation
* Provide support with projects or weekly lists
* Business Communications in a professional environment
* Other duties as assigned

I've already accepted the second offer and would have to renege on it to accept the first offer. The first offer also seems more finance-y, which I don't like as much since I want to get into tech. However, the first offer would be in-person and offer more chances for networking and meeting other interns. Salaries are similar for both. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"

Right now I’m wrapping up the first half of Python Crash Course (fundamental stuff) and I’m gonna do 2 projects to get myself accustomed to coding in Python then take MIT’s 6.006 (Intro to Algo. in Python) over the summer. I  also applied to Google CSSI and Kode with Klossy so hopefully I’ll get in and learn webdev basics and build some nice projects to put in my resume during the summer. When freshman year starts, I’ll start leetcoding and try to get into freshman internships like Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, etc. If I don’t get into those programs, my back up plan is to intern at a local company in the spring and intern at a Vietnamese tech company during the summer when I go back there to visit home. Then, I’ll apply again to those programs (STEP, Facebook University,etc.) or intern at a unicorn my sophomore year summer. Ultimately, I hope to intern/co-op or work at JS, HRT, Citadel, Citsec, Radix, Headlands, Jump, 5R, DESCO, IMC, Akuna, or DRW. 

Based on my rough plan and goal, could you please suggest detailed actions that can take and is there something I should change in my plan? Should I just keep grinding leetcode? Is there any resource that I should be aware of? I’m going to a top-50 public school but I’m confident that I can be as competent as my Ivy+ peers."

To earn income, I travel all over the country and work a very physically demanding job. It pays well, and I do the best I can to save every dollar I can. I live out of my vehicle. I focus hard on saving and earning, and also investing.

I’m at the point of slapping my wife across the face. 

I opened a business, she was in charge of it. We agreed she would do the accounting, but instead, she decided not to do any accounting, and take extended vacations (closing the business instead, sometimes several weeks, sometimes months). 

I argued with her for years, to simply provide the accounting to me so I could see if we were profitable or not. It never happened.

It was a small café, I saw Covid begin ramping up, I begged her to close the doors for good, if we couldn’t find someone to sell the business to. She didn’t do that, instead she took the advice of some fucking moron who isn’t paying for it, and bought more kitchen equipment. 

The business was forced to close. 


My wife was begging for a new phone. I decided I would, but had my money tied up in something else. I used Ethereum to pay for it (10 ETH) is what I sent her, then, about $1300. Not her fault. Just a stupid thing to do I my part, although I bought all that ETH back again.

I sent my wife 2 Ethereum to hold until I got back to Mexico ( where my wife lives) I was hoping she would hold it, and we wouldn’t pay capital gains when it made a move last winter, as it does almost every winter. She promised she wouldn’t sell, guess what she fucking did?

Mind you, she had no reason at all to use it, I was sending her several hundred dollars a week to live on. Which in Mexico, is more money than some earn in a entire year. More than a doctor or lawyer in many cases. Well, she fucked that up to.

She says she doesn’t have clothes. I sent her money specifically to buy clothes, she somehow fucked it up.

I bought her a new Honda scooter to use for transportation, because she told me she could ride a motorcycle, well she decided to ride it without the helmet I bought her , had an accident and chipped a tooth. Scared to ride since. I told her not to sell it. She traded it for a piece of shit Jetta that has been a money pit going on two years now. God damn….

So I finally arrived in Mexico this year, with new everything for her, including a new laptop. I was hoping she had some money saved, but that was a lie. I hoped conditions improved, over the years I’ve been visiting and sending money. Nope. Barely any evidence I ever sent a dime.

Than she tells me today she needs new contacts. She tore one. I said well, that sucks, we’ll get you glasses because I’m tired of having some fucking emergency every few weeks or months. I said we’re married now, you don’t need to worry about being attractive to other men.

She says glasses will be more expensive, I am about to explode due to her uttter lack of any foresight whatsoever. I say tough shit, when you get done with your 1 year unpaid internship and start finally pulling your god damn weight you can buy whatever the fuck you want and shove it in your fucking eye (except I didn’t say that, but I wanted to, you get the jist) 

It’s a constant battle trying to show my wife that you don’t have to be poor unless you are disabled or an idiot, or you marry one of those two people.

I’m starting to feel like I really fucked up. 

I’m laying in my minivan, in below freezing temperatures, unsure if I’ll have enough money to survive until my first paycheck at my new job, a job that pays half of what I made before, that I must take because my god damn ignorant fuck up money vacuum of a wife didn’t do a thing I asked her to do and that she also agreed to do. I’ve fucking had it with that ignorant fucking idiot."

Obviously i'd like to include Purdue in my net, posting here to see if Purdue to Indy would be too far during the summer, or the school year should we extend. Is this kind of commute normal for you guys given the school's location?

I honestly don’t know how I made it this far in the process granted that I didn’t expect anything from the position in the first place. In their qualifications page I noticed that it says “Former experience or internship in Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, Penetration Testing, or Red Team is valuable” and although I read about this in textbooks and had some homework assignments revolved around it , I never really had specific hands-on experience with it. I also don’t meet the preferred GPA requirement. This makes me feel unqualified and I don’t see myself being taken seriously as a candidate.

I'm also taking a coursera specialization for IT and have been wondering if it would help me land a job before I officially graduate?"
u5gahc,3,2022-04-17,Javascript vs Python in terms of jobs?,Hislerim,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u5gahc/javascript_vs_python_in_terms_of_jobs/,I am interested in front-end development and taught myself some basics of Javascript. I also know the basics of python due to a small internship I had done. I have now got into a Masters program which focuses completely on Python and it starts in September. I want to be job-ready by the end of the year so I have decided to learn programming full time starting now. But I am confused on what to focus on. Should I just continue to learning JS since I like web development ? Or should I switch to python to be prepare for my master's program? Which of the two are used more in the industry? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I've been mostly involved in frontend, but the last couple of months, around 70% of my assigned tasks were backend (AWS /w CDK) after I specifically asked them for more of that work. I can handle some of the more common uses of serverless but as of late they've been expecting me to work on more complex problems from implementing state machines, coming up with event driven architecture on my own all the while having to pay attention to good DB design. The scope is small, but the concepts are new even to the senior engineers I'm working with. It was exciting to work with but with minimal guidance I feel like I'm running around in circles and it's burning me out without even writing a line of code. It's even worse and demoralizing when I read about people getting 100k jobs with zero experience while I get paid comically low wages cause I'm from the a third world nation.

It's a small start up and I feel like I'm not pulling my weight here, especially since I was the one to request backend work.

Does this seem like a me problem or am I justified in saying that this is a bit too above my paygrade?"

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which was being raided by space pirates, of which Ryan was currently hiding from. He looked at his options. The communications were probably guarded, and it was the same with the escape pods. But his gun? They didn't know about it, and it was likely they didn't even know which room was his, or that it was even him, specifically, that escaped, if they knew anyone escaped at all. 


It was the only advantage he could get without walking straight towards the pirates. He steeled himself and mapped his route to his room. He was trained for this. Kind of, at least. Ryan snuck through the hallway between the medbay and engine room. Walking into the next room, he had a very close call with what looked like another Russian armed with an AN-2037 before Ryan hid behind cover. 


He wasn't sure if he had been for sure spotted or not, but regardless, the pirate was approaching. Ryan searched the area, desperately looking for a way out. He couldn't sneak to any different cover, the receptionist counter Ryan ducked behind wasn't near anything else. The room was fairly clear other than the lone counter. The only other option was-... OH COME ON! 


He stared at the vent cover as it taunted him. He bitched as quietly he could at God for the bullshit he was having to endure right now. Why was it always the vents? He grumpily and silently pulled the cover off with little resistance and reluctantly climbed in.


""If you're back there, come out. *Now*,"" demanded the pirate. Luckily, he sounded like he was still a good few meters away, and he confirmed that he hadn't officially spotted Ryan yet. Ryan placed the cover back and crawled, his arms hunched in, trying to make the tiny vent seem as roomy as he could. It still felt like his chest didn't have enough room to breath, even though it had more than plenty. He forced himself to control his breathing. If he hyperventilated here, the ruskie in the room behind him could probably hear it. 


Ryan's heart pounded in his chest as the vent felt like it closed in on him, shrinking as he crawled. *Just your mind playing tricks on you,* he rationalized. He turned a corner, likely having officially left the eyesight of the one pirate. He found himself with a new problem, however. The vent most definitely got smaller. *God. Damnit.* 


_


Bowler hated this. He knew he'd still have to kill, and even assassinate the targets his higher-ups designated for his little group of involuntary privateers. But he had at least hoped his targets wouldn't be *human* anymore. He supposed that killing sapient creatures in general wasn't any better, but it still would have been easier to tolerate, if only on some instinctual level. 


Unfortunately, the EEI had other plans. He had taken the ship with relative ease once he had successfully flown the ""escape pods"" from his own ship through the windows. They quickly moved on to the communications room after clearing the armory. Louise kept an eye on the Comms room after they ziptied up all of the xenos and the few humans in the area. As they then cleared the escape pods and the navigation room, rounding up the straggling snakes and the couple of humans currently awake, they slowly cleared the entire ship. Ryan was scheduled to be asleep at the moment. 


The story was going to be that he would ""be made an example for anyone who wanted to be a hero"". And as they burst through the room, he was nowhere to be seen. *Fuck.* Of course, it was possible he was elsewhere in the ship. Maybe his room, or the Medbay, or the cafeteria getting a snack. He outlined the possibilities in his head as they dragged an Embuos out from a vent. 


He had almost gotten in there unseen, too, but the creature's massive shoulders hindered him too much. Alexei dragged the snake out of the vent by his tail as Bowler pointed his gun at the snake to be sure he didn't try and pull anything. Seeing the gun, the Embuos was plenty compliant. Alexei used no shortage of force in zip-tying him after the fact. After they rounded up everyone who had been asleep, Bowler confirmed it. Ryan wasn't here. *Bollocks*. 


He began sweeping the area with his men. He sent Nikolai and Dmitri to investigate the medbay. Eleanor kept all of the prisoners in check, and Alexei was sent to the engine room to see if Ryan had gone there. Boxer headed to the escape pods as he ordered Louise to comms. Ryan had to be here on the ship. There wasn't anywhere else he could have fucking *gone*.  Bowler grunted to himself, annoyed. He charged down the hallways to the escape pods. 


_


Ryan stared at the shrinking passage. It felt like it was fucking taunting him. Oh, Ryan could fit through it, sure. If he was comfortable with no shoulder room and a light probability of getting fucking stuck in there. 


Ryan took a few deep breaths. He could do this. It was just a… a maintenance hatch. Totally. It's just… a maintenance hatch… He found his attempt to fool himself out of his claustrophobia was not working. 


*Ryan, what are you doing?!* he demanded of himself. *You either climb through the damn vent or they catch you!* Alright. He looked at the vent. On three. Three. Two. One. Zero. Go. Go… Now… Go. Ryan couldn't move. 


*Please?* he begged himself. His muscles were firmly locked. *Look, Ryan, if you don't get into that vent, what do you think they're going to do to Gexie? And Derissi? And everyone else?* he pleaded. Ryan sighed. *Goddamnit. Okay. Three. Two. One.* He crawled into the vent before he could have any more second thoughts. 


It only took about a dozen meters before the claustrophobia set in as he couldn't even stand on his hands and knees anymore, forced into an army crawl as his head bumped the ceiling and the walls hugged his side. *Ohhhhhh Jesus this was a mistake,* he whined as his heart pounded angrily and he felt the nausea settling in. The walls threatened to squeeze the life out of him. He crawled as fast as he could. Ryan didn't care if they heard him crawling around anymore. He just wanted *out*. 


He sped through the tight vent as fast as he could, trying his utmost to wiggle himself out of the vent. *This sucks, this sucks, THIS SUCKS!* He didn't see an exit yet. What if there wasn't one? Oh God! What if he had crawled into a space he couldn't crawl out of??? He felt his entire body shake as panic seeped in. Ryan continued to crawl through the shaking and sweating and nauseous dizziness. 


There had to be an exit. There had to be! He had to get out, he had to get out, he had to *get OUT!* He turned another corner, praying to see an exit. *Oh thank Christ!* He sped up, punching down the vent cover. Ryan couldn't care if they heard him right now as he pulled himself out as fast as he could, making no shortage of noise. 


He took a desperate gasp for air, his rapid breathing slowing to an almost normal pace. The fresh air and moving room didn't completely calm him down at first, forcing him to take a minute to breathe. He slumped against the wall as he forced himself to cool down. Holy Hell, he hated that. That was honest-to-God psychological torture. 


He took a minute to breathe, hugging his knees as his head rested against the wall. Fuck that. Ryan wasn't ever going into a crawlspace like that even if it killed him. Slowly, he stood back up and got his bearings. He was in the dormitory. *Well that's convenient,* he realized as his room stared him in the face. Time to arm up.


_


Louise was more than a little annoyed. Instead of looting an alien spaceship for every penny it was worth, they were hunting down some poor *enfoiré* that Agent apparently wanted dead or alive for one reason or another. Whoever the poor dirty blonde kid was, he had managed to slip Agent's grasp so far. Louise was sent to watch over the comms room and make sure noone called for help, but things were pretty fucking quiet. All this expensive alien technology in his grasp, and Louise was just playing guard duty. It pissed him off. He spun around in the human chair, bored out of his mind. Even if the man of the hour showed up here, he was going to be unarmed, unless he grabbed a pipe or something along the way, which was still irrelevant to the MP5 in his grasp. The automatic door opened, and the man of the hour stood right before him. Louise chuckled at the poor bastard.


_


Ryan stood there like a dumbass. He somehow forgot that the doors were automatic, and now a gun was pointed at him. The pirate chuckled. 


""Get in here,"" he ordered. Ryan slowly walked into the room as the door closed back up. The pirate let down his weapon to speak into his radio. Ryan didn't hesitate, bringing his pistol up to fire as the opportunity presented itself.


""Drop the weapon,"" he ordered with no amount of uncertainty as to what would happen if he didn't. The pirate went to bring up his gun again. Ryan fired."

To give a bit of background about me, I am a non-EU national currently finishing up a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering here in my home country. I am skilled in Python and the broad scientific computing Python stack including ML frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. Over the course of my bachelor's degree, I've worked on machine learning research and open-source development (I have developed ML libraries of my own).  I've done (remote) research internships at two reputable US universities and ML engineering internships at two startups. My work at the startups revolved around  developing prototype ML models and I didn't really get a chance to do tasks like data engineering or taking models to production, things which an ML engineer would normally do in their job.  I lack some essential skills expected of an ML engineer like building data pipelines, model and data monitoring, cloud serving of models, etc.

I've been extremely lucky to find a research engineer position at a research organization in the EU. I'll be starting there this year and have a contract for 2 years. After I'm done with this job, I would like to continue to stay in the EU and will be searching for a job in industry there. When applying for jobs, all my past experience (internships + job) would have been in ML. However, I wouldn't like to restrict myself to searching for ML jobs. I would be happy to work in any sort for software development job and my sole criterion would be to maximize my chances of finding a job. Keeping this in mind, I was wondering what skills I should develop in the next two years so that I can be best placed to find a job in the EU. Data scientist jobs would suit my skills I guess, but ideally I'd like my work to be more software development heavy. Data scientist jobs also mandate having a master's degree in most cases. I think data engineering roles would be the closest fit for my profile after ML engineering ones and I was thinking that I should pick up on skills for that. However, I'm concerned that not too many ML / data engineer jobs exist and whether it would make my job search difficult. Such jobs also seem to require a master's degree in some cases. The other obvious option, I guess, is to learn web development since there are plenty of jobs related to it. However, my concern is that I would have no experience at all in WebD even if I learnt it, and if that would make me a weak candidate while applying for jobs.

I wanted to know if you guys have any suggestions on what skills I should pick up so that I have the least difficulty in finding my next job after my current one ends in two years. Any advice with pointers on what specific tech stack to learn would be highly appreciated!

Thanks!"

This year, I am taking all required statistics, computer science and mathematics courses which enables me to switch major to any of those fields, or do a double major.

I first played with HTML/CSS at about 10, slowly evolving into JavaScript and eventually got involved with cheats and games. I began to work hundreds of hours with C++ as a result, alongside PHP/MySQL for personal projects. I stopped doing any of it for 2 years, before I took up Python quickly again once required this year for formal education - university. 

I am doing fine/okay with math, my GPA is sitting at an A- roughly. Computer science at college level feels like a rerun so is no issue. Stats I do similarly to math, but with lesser personal interest. 

I am now having to make the decision between continuing honours mathematics, which would mean mostly math, some probability theory, and algorithms the only CS course. Or alternatively, a double major between mathematics and CS with some probability theory if it fits. Either option will be complemented by self study. 

I have the opportunity to intern at a solid company later this year with Java and JavaScript being required languages. I enjoy math, but I remember loving CS so much - the passion just fizzled a little. I feel as though I have my foot in the door into becoming a ‘mathematically inclined’ software engineer, but it means giving up home on all data analytics/modelling/quantitative aspects of my career by dropping the stats/math focus. 

I’m not sure what to do."

I started my job recently in Germany and my company offer home office as well as office work options.  But I have a problem in doing home office, so I opted for office work. However, I need to go to the office only when two persons are present in the office, one for fire safety and other for first aid. Therefore, my working timings should entirely depends on those two persons, who actually got training and they are my colleagues as well.

Then coming to corona, when we go to restaurants once in a week, someone will get corona, mainly my manager, who is a bit old guy.

If someone gets corona in our team, I have to do home office for 10 days according to company policies. During the home office, I need to spend 12-14 hours to do 5 hours task and I need to do lots of circus to focus on my work in the room( shared apartment or WG).

I have already told my manager about my condition during the home office, still he says company rules and bla bla bla.

 I am still in probationary period. Therefore , I don't know what to do now?

 I chose this company over other 4 offers, because of company reputation. 

Questions:
1. How can I express again myself to my manager to allow me to work according my convince, mainly to work in office?(he is bit older and a German, I don't want to be rude to him as well as not to make him angry) 

2. What if he says same thing again such as company policy and bla bla bla? 

3. I already saw his angry on the very first day, when I said, I am not good at home office and want to work in office? I am bit Afraid of him now. 

The problems, which I have during the home office. 
- My productivity, performance and efficiency will be less than 10% as compared to regular office work. 
- it has lots of negative impact on my mental health, because I have been doing home office for my internships and master thesis. 
- sometimes I feel like I am wasting my professional life in doing home office, not learning new skills just by spending whole day to do office work. 

Briefly the question? 

What are the things, I should mention to my manager, when I tell him about my problem in doing home office and also regular office work depending upon someone's timings? 

Note : when there are no first aid and fire safety persons present in the office, I am not allowed to do regular office, so I need to do home office work. 

Could someone help me with my questions please! 

Thanks in advance"

I'm currently half way through my bachelors and I'm starting to question if I am good enough to continue. I am studying to work in the environmental or biological sciences and I love my field. I love plants and birds and would one day like to work with either, but things have taken a toll these last few years and I'm starting to wonder if I am good enough to be in this field. I used to go to a physical campus in another state, but since covid hit I lot my job at the time and was struggling to pay the rent so I moved back home, but the local college is really small and only have a handful of degrees (most of which are AAs or AS) So I decided to go to an online college. I continued on my courses and even got a job that pays well now, but I struggle with some of my classes. Now granted I haven't failed any, I have a few classes where my final grade was a C, but what bothers me is all of those classes are ones that are about my degree. Chemistry, Biology, Statistics are all classes that directly connect with my degree and with some I barely scraped up that C. I study and feel like I understand, but when I get back my tests and see how much I missed I feel stupid for thinking I understood anything. Now usually I would just get back on my feet and buckle down, but after this happening to several classes I'm starting to think maybe I just am not smart enough for this. 

This is also coupled with I got rejected from my 9th summer internship that I applied for, only one I even got an interview for. I love my job, but I really wanted these summer internships to get my foot in the door to kickstart actually experiencing what it would be like in a real STEM career and local opportunities are few so I do not have that many options.

It sucks because I really love learning, and I really want to continue, but I'm already in so much debt and I'm so worried that maybe I'm just not good enough for this. It scares me that I'm only half way through and struggling this much, I've asked for help from my professors, some have been helpful, but some had not. I'm worried if I get into the field and I start working with professionals, they will look at me as someone stupid or someone who doesn't belong there. 

I really need some advice right now, I don't know if its normal to feel like this."

In the second interview, I was able to not only solve the problem but also provide a brute force and an optimized solution alongside stating the time and space complexity. I felt had a bit of rapport with the interviewer so this might have gone well.
The third interviewer was honestly looking depressed but I was able to solve the problem which he gave me.

I had a quick question involving the internship opportunities for CS students studying at the Paul G. Allen School at UW Seattle. Is it often true that internships are still extremely difficult to come by even as an Allen school student? I have friends at the school that mention that the career fairs aren’t really that fruitful and that one must apply to 400+ internships to barely get an interview. I was wondering if you all could expand on this(ex. Sharing tips and advice for what helped you) and maybe share your experiences for this, as I know for a CS major getting an internship is a major step toward getting a full-time job later on. 

Additionally, is it true that when applying for internships, all UW campuses appear the same on an application and have access to the same career fairs? I ask because I had read somewhere else that when applying on LinkedIn or other sites, UW Bothell and UW Seattle just appear as UW, even though both programs are significantly different in regards to name and prestige (no disrespect to UWB). 

If you guys could provide some thoughts, I would greatly appreciate it!"

I will have to pay in-state costs for Rutgers (30-35k/year) vs out of state costs for UMD (57-60k). I'm planning to finish in 3 years at both schools to reduce the cost, but thats my best case scenario assuming I can get more credits from the ap's ill be taking soon and from summer classes at a community college. I will have to end up taking a loan for 50-60k at UMD and probably very little/none at RU (3 years). 

Honestly really confused about which school is a better option. I've informally visited both but I also want to know about whether RU actually has a good career fair and whether a majority of CS people there can get good internships and jobs and whether they can go to big tech from there. Did you receive more internships through the career fair or through connections?

For NJ people that had the choice of UMD or RU, did you like that you made the decision to go to RU?"

Next year I'm committed to WPI as a double major in CS and Robotics Engineering, but I'm more focused on the CS side.

As for my current experience, I've been ""seriously"" programming since about the start of high school. I have an iOS app for my school that is used by \~700 students / day. I have a few websites. I've made some simple games. I experience with SQL, no-sql databases, and creating/using APIs. I've competed in FRC for 4 years, and I've worked as a paid instructor at a coding school.

I'm looking for my first technical internship over the summer, and I'm not quite sure where to start. Most of the internships I've found are intended for students who already have at least one year of college. I feel like I have more experience than the average high school graduate, but I feel like any application I turn in will get immediately thrown out.

What's the best way to get started? I already created a resume with the information I listed here, but I'm not sure how I should go about applying. Should I only apply online, or is there value in walking into an office? Should I go for bigger companies, or will I have better luck trying to find a startup?

STGamz is the name of my game company. 

It is time to decide what the hell I'm gonna be doing for the rest of my life, or next year's to come. I am very stressed out, and this is the one point in my life where I just completely don't know what to do. Game development and 2d/3d animation is my side husle.

 By May 1st I have to decide from the following:

1. I go to a good college, (UNH, Durham) majoring in computer science but I will be in a lot of debt (over $100,00). The good thing is that I am very likely to get a job and pay off debt . Also I will have a social life, also get subjects from physics, math, be exposed to AI/machine learning, something I like.

2. Go to a shitty college for two years (UCONN Hartford) but then be transfered to the main campus after 2 years which is either as good or better than UNH. Good thing is that I'm basically paying around $5,000 a year, it's free. Bad thing is that I'm in some ACES program where I will be doing basic studies, and its not clear how long that is before I can transition to CS, and it's not even clear if I will be doing CS because they said ""if they have space"". 

3. Fuck college, and do a remote coding bootcamp where I will completely learn how to be a full stack developer, good thing is, high chance of me getting a high paying job and from there maybe I can save up to create my own program/business while doing STGamz on the side (OR at least do this as a gap year and then apply to colleges again). Bad thing is that I will have no social life, no more friends, just me, the bootcamp, the gym, STGamz and my art youtube channel. But then its ""which bootcamp do I even choose? Coding dojo? Fullstack? MIT bootcamp? "" 


My anxiety is eating me up, if anyone has any experience in these fields, or knows anyone that can shed some light on me I will be forever grateful. 

Thank you,
Steven"

Using the shell, bash scripting, the file formats (fasta/q, bam, vcf...), using bioinformatics tools, managing a pipeline with Snakemake and  an environment with Conda... You know, the basics. I also deepened my knowledge of population genetics.

What I'd like to know is: **What should I have under my belt if I want to do the next internship in academia with researchers working on protein design?**

For what I can see it's kinda a niche in bioinformatics, since most of you here work on omics data, where the tools and workflows are quite similar to the ones I used. But I don't know if it's the same for molecular simulation/design. For exemple, do they also work with the Holy Trinity that is Python-R-Bash?

In my first two years of higher education, I did learn some biochemistry (basic concepts of protein structure e.g. primary to quaternary structure, pathways like Krebs and Calvin, enzyme kinetics...). But I'm year 4 now and it seems long ago. Plus, for what I can gather, it looks like most people working in the field come from chemistry rather than biology.

I was thinking about reading a bit of documentation on Baker Lab's Rosetta and DeepMind's AlphaFold. 

What do you think? Is it still possible for me to take that route? What should I know by heart before even contacting an academician if I want a positive response?"

I have a good opportunity to keep continuing my internship as a mech designer part-time for the next 2 years until I graduate. It is totally up to me how many hours I work, but I’m thinking of working minimum 20 hours and max 30 hours.

For those of you who work, how many hours do you work? Are you able to maintain good grades? And are you able to maintain a social/healthy lifestyle such as going to the gym (I workout 2 hours daily and it’s very important for me), maybe going out once a week?

Personally for me what is the most important:
Mental Health (I see a psychologist once a week and read books one hour every day about self improvement) &gt; Gym (2 hours every day) &gt; Work (Flexible, would like to work 20 hours since it is directly related to my field) &gt; Grades (Maintain GPA above 3.5) &gt; Social Life (Going out once every week to do golfing/skiing for the entire day and enjoying the day with friends, but not really important). I have maintained everything so far, but adding work to that mix will be a new experience for me. 

Disclaimer: I have not been to school for 8 months and have just focused on my internship and myself.

If you answered “yes” to all of the above questions, how do you do it, any tips would be appreciated it.

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

Right now I am coasting through with C/B and the occasional A. Hence my feeling to start self learning things so I actually have skills + certs vs just a degree. 

I know nothing about coding outside my course work, which is why I want to pick a niche and get really good at it. 

Q) What else is out there other than just Software Engineer? I guess what I am really asking is, what is the power/ range of my CS degree?

I really like IT work and Cybersecurity intrigues me but I know nothing about it (I took CS because I wanted to hack people lol) and surprisingly I really liked Assembly and C. I also like logistics and history. (idk just thought I'd add it lol)

I just feel like there has to be much more possibilities position wise other than just SWE SWE SWE and LEETCODE LEETCODE LEETCODE (which I'm not bad at but ughhhh) which might intrigue me. Is there like a useful chart of all the ""fields"" and such? 

I would love cybersecurity but I am scared to start because I am kinda overwhelmed with school, all the certs and technologies just seem like more school work at the moment. If you are in this field, how did you bridge the gap between CS and security?

I don't even know what I'm talking about to be honest I just want to find my specialization early, I don't care what it is. I just want to be able to talk and be a mastermind in it because I picked it (the ego will give me motivation lol). 

So tell me, what's out there? Because google has just made me more confused. I know some might say the ""drive"" isn't there and CS isn't for me but trust me it is, I am just an overthinker that needs a plan.

Sorry for the read this is what goes through my head while studying for exams lol. 

TL;DR - I want to specialize but I don't know what to pick from, drop some ""fields"" and some of the ""first steps"" which could help me find my niche! (Background is in Java +android and C)"

I plan on studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Aerospace.

I got accepted to the college of engineering at MSU for the Fall semester, but unfortunately I was too afraid of getting rejected by UofM Ann Arbor; so I did not send in my application… (My hs GPA when I was applying was 3.8, SAT 1320, and ACT 30) Although I did get accepted to both the UofM Flint and Dearborn locations.

If I take the MSU route I will fully commit and spend all of my undergrad years there, but if I take the UofM route I’ll do 1 or 2 years at Dearborn and then transfer to Ann Arbor. 

I’ve done as much as I could to help myself make a decision, such as making all the calculations, listing pros and cons, researching etc. Despite my efforts I still can’t come to a conclusion on where to go…

May I ask why some of you decided to attend UofM? How hard is it to transfer here from UofM Dearborn? How is the environment here? How do the professors and classes here compare to MSU? When it comes to finding jobs in the aerospace industry does attending UofM give me a better advantage? How are the internships here? Is it truly worth the expense to attend this school? Why should I choose UofM?"

I have really enjoyed the experience and feel I have grown a lot as a person and learned a great deal about my likes a dislikes. I've performed well in all my courses landing me at the top of my class as well as several internships at large Oil/Gas and Mining companies and have been happy for the most part with my decision.

However, I've always had a second love for computer science but ultimately decided on Mechanical Engineering. As time has gone on, especially this semester, I have found myself feeling like I should have chosen software engineering  or CS instead. This nagging voice in my head has lead me to research what would be involved in the switch to CS;  if I were able to receive transfer credit for all the math/science related course's I have done so far (as I suspect I could) it looks as though a computer science degree would only take 3 semesters (15 courses) to complete. I'm torn because I find myself wanting to finish what I have started with my mechanical engineering degree, but also have a strong attraction to CS. 

Ultimately, I've narrowed down my options to:

a) Switch to CS next semester and abandon my engineering degree.

b) Finish my engineering degree and then immediately enroll in CS fulltime to complete a second bachelor's degree.

c) Finish my engineering degree, work fulltime (if I can land a job on graduation) , and do CS courses part time.

d) Don't pursue CS at all and finish my engineering degree

I worry that  a CS degree may be a waste of time for what amounts to little actual gain in terms of employability/career prospects. Also, I worry that I may just have a romanticized idea of what CS would actually be like and could hate it. Any advice or wisdom would be greatly appreciated!"

UC Berkeley or Community College?,Indecisive_Mess10,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u64uek/which_college_should_i_choose_uc_berkeley_or/,"Hi, everyone. I’m having some trouble deciding which college I should attend, UC Berkeley or my local community college.

Side note: I got waitlisted to UCI, UCSD, and UCLA for Biochemistry as my applied major

I know Cal has a strong reputation and high prestige (but to be honest, I’m not a prestige chaser), and I’ll be making strong connections/networkings there. Some other pros is that if I go to Cal, I’ll get to experience “the” college life and make new friends immediately. I will also get to be exposed to more research opportunities in comparison to CC.

The downside with Cal is that I know it is super competitive and far from where I live. The competitiveness and rigorous classes are mostly where my hesitancy to attend stems from. The huge grade deflation is also another great concern of mine. I’m majoring in Biochemistry and hope to enter the dental field, so I need to go into grad school (dental school). This means that I have to maintain a relatively high gpa but that will be difficult at Cal. I also know that they do not have a hospital or clinics. They do have a Dental Society though, but I’m not too certain how great it is. I also heard that the classes are large, around 300 students to a class. Apparently it’s really hard to connect with teachers and there’s plenty of student attending office hours (30 students) so it’s difficult to get any one on one.

Some pros about Community College is that I get free tuition and I’ll probably even get paid to go there due to financial aid. Furthermore, I can do a direct and guaranteed transfer to UCI which is the school I originally wanted to attend. It’ll also be easier at community college and my grades should be near-perfect if anything.

The con about community college is that I won’t be having any friends and I’ll be alone for two years. Furthermore, I feel like I would be wasting all of my hardships in high school if I go to CC. I did a lot of extracurriculars and AP classes and I’d feel like my hard work would go to waste.

I forgot to mention that Cal gave me a scholarship and received financial aid, so I only have to pay 8K a year to attend. Which, for that type of education, is not bad at all. And I know I would be able to pay it off in a descent amount of time as a dentist.

Here are my stats for reference:

3.8-3.9 unweighted; 4.1-4.2 weighted GPA

10 AP classes (WHAP, AP Psych., AP Environ., AP Chem., AP Lang., AP Bio., AP Calc AB, AP Lit., AP Gov., AP Econ.)

5 Honor Classes (H Eng. 1, H Bio., H Eng. 2, H Chem., H Pre-Calc.)

20 Extracurriculars (hospital volunteer, dental internships, dabbled in mental health field, business, competitions (won awards), etc.)

I’m not trying to brag because I’m honestly considered average in my year. A lot of my classmate carry the same amount as I am, if not more. I come from a fairly competitive school.

IMPORTANT: Something I think is worth mentioning, although I am quite embarrassed to admit, is that I struggled in stem during high school. I got a B- in Honors Chemistry, a B+ in AP Chemistry, and a B- in AP Calculus AB. But most of that is because my teacher decided to drop my final so I clutched my grade.

What do you guys think is the best course of action? Go to Cal and risk my GPA or go to community college being a longer for two years to get a direct transfer to my “dream” college, UCI? I like UCI because it’s considered a mid UC and I feel like I will be competing with people around my level. At Cal, I’ll be competing with people far better than me, elites if you will, and will struggle a lot more. Please let me know your honest thoughts and opinions. I need to commit by May 1st. Thank you for your time!"
u663vz,2,2022-04-18,PC vs Laptop usage for student who's into VR Development.,deebee1713,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/u663vz/pc_vs_laptop_usage_for_student_whos_into_vr/,"Question regarding desktop or laptop for Unity devs who are students and are holding jobs/internships and who are gamers. I am in a dilemma over desktop vs laptop. More in post.

So I have the budget for an i9-12900H 3070ti laptop, which would imply I have the budget for a full on desktop pc.

But my dilemma is that should I go for laptop or desktop as I'm still a student, might go abroad for university next year, have an internship at a national institution where there's already workstations available but poorly managed and shared. I also have a 1050ti laptop currently that's basically slow for Unity these days as I open up 2-3 projects, have chrome tabs count upto 10-15, and I am getting into VR development. So that means my current laptop keeps freezing, I can't use oculus link, and risk of losing progress due to system hanging and me having to restart.

I am also a casual gamer, during early college I enjoyed fps games, but now have shifted into sim racing, may again embrace R6S. I would mostly play Assetto Corsa in VR, and games like GOW, Days Gone etc. Have a PS4 for Gran Turismo.

But I know games will anyway run at least 60fps on a laptop that I mentioned the specs of, but what I want more is smooth performance when I work with multiple Unity projects and Chrome tabs. Some times tabs are too much so I just group them or create separate windows for personal googling or entertainment and separate window with work related tabs.

So coming back to my circumstance, ie, student who may go to uni but has an internship which allows WFH and has workstation at place of work, should I stick to laptop or get a future proof pc?

PC:
Price to perform ratio is good
Long term
Upgradable
Cheaper
Immovable 

Laptop:
Movable
Short term
Price to perform ratio bad
Non upgradable
Expensive"
u66sy3,27,2022-04-18,Didn't Receive an Offer After the Internship,Jonerotten,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/u66sy3/didnt_receive_an_offer_after_the_internship/,"A few weeks ago I got a phone call from one of the campus recruiters stating that I would not be receiving a grad offer after completing my internship. He stated that my work was good and that I got along with everyone I worked with but my PDM (mentor - senior manager) felt that I would not stay and blocked an offer from being sent out.

After reading some posts here, it seems that you'd have to be the absolutely dogshite in order to not receive an offer. Because of this I am worried about my characteristics as an employee - I am not too concerned with not working for the firm itself. 



So my question is what does ""would not stay"" actually mean? Is it corporate speak for something or am I to take it at face value?



I'll put some background information here, as I have been trying to investigate as to why I am unemployable.

- The internship was in auditing (if that helps).

- I am doing well at university; I have a very competitive GPA, have participated in finance competitions and I am a president of a student society.

- I am a mature aged student - I was 25 whilst doing the internship (if it makes a difference).

- I am unemployed whilst going through university - this is by choice, as I am back to living with my parents and have substantial savings from my old job.


Reasons why I think I should've gotten an offer:

- I got along with everyone I worked with, or so I thought. I did not feel any friction between anyone I worked with, everyone would always say good morning with a smile and I was always invited to come out to lunch. I know it sounds too good to be true, but I genuinely believe that I got along with everyone (at face value at least, I can't really read minds).

- I was always the first or second member of the team to arrive at the client's site and I was never late.

- All of my work was done ahead of time or on time and to a good standard (so I was told). I actually asked for more work, to which my manager allowed me to work on 2 engagements simultaneously.

- Always received good feedback from the managers I've worked under.

- I thoroughly prepared for every meeting with my PDM and the meeting with the Partner. My meeting with the PDM would almost always go over time. It always starts off with me discussing my weaknesses and I would present my plan to overcome them, along with possible problems in the plan and solutions to overcome these. The meeting would always then turn into general chit chat - to which I believe we got on quite well. My meeting with the partner involved a discussion about the internship itself. In order to distinguish myself from the other interns, I thought I would spend time coming up with 10 points on the internship, 4 good points, 3 iffy points and 3 things the other Big4 firms have done. I also tried to ask career advice related questions (classic tactic in making old men feel good about themselves) The meeting did end on time with no chit chat.


Reasons why I probably did not get an offer:

- I had to be reminded to leave most times. Interns are usually only allowed to work to 5pm, but my team would start telling me to go home when they noticed it was 5:30pm. There was quite a bit of work to do and I have always preferred to complete the task at hand, rather than finish it at 50% and then continue on it the next day.

- I mentioned in my interview that it was a dream of mine to own my own business. Tbh, I only said this to differentiate myself in an interview and to tick the entrepreneurial/passion for business interview box.

- I mentioned to my buddy that I would pursue medicine in the future. This could've been my undoing, but I have no reason to believe that my buddy to would betray me. We got on quite well and on my last day she gave me a big hug and said ""Can't wait to work with you again next year.""

- The grad job itself is a significant downgrade in terms of pay, responsibility and meaningful work when compared to my old job. My previous job was in the Army, I was paid ~84k AUD (vs 60k for the grad role) and I had around 12-15 people working for me. But surely they didn't hire me as an intern without any intention of making a grad offer in the first place?"
u67e9o,2,2022-04-18,How securing a scholarship can boost your career path,SCHOLADADMIN,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/u67e9o/how_securing_a_scholarship_can_boost_your_career/,"  

Schools, colleges, and universities can be costly. There’s no doubt about it. And securing a scholarship can make education more accessible to students. In this blog, we will discuss what a scholarship is, how it can help with your educational and career goals, and what impact scholarships can have on the various aspects of your life.

## A brief overview of what Scholarships are

A scholarship is another word for the financial assistance that a candidate receives to pay for certain aspects of his/her educational expenses, such as tuition fees or living expenses or both. Unlike a loan, it is a gift of sorts, for which there is no requirement to repay the amount received. In this respect, you can consider [scholarships](https://scholad.com) as free money that you can use, but only for certain earmarked purposes. 

Students can earn this financial aid from many sources including government foundations, charities, colleges, universities, schools, business organizations, etc. Each scholarship program requires certain criteria to be fulfilled before a candidate can receive the award. A community, or scholarship board, reviews a bunch of documents submitted by candidates to determine whether or not they are qualified to receive the aid. 

## Factors considered when granting scholarships

Scholarships are prestigious awards, and hence, most schools or offering institutions use the scores candidates earn in terms of their academic performance, community involvement, relevant work history, and/or financial need of the student. There are several factors that determine the ability of candidates to obtain scholarships.

Investment is one of the core necessities of many Indian students, especially if they intend to opt for careers that require years of formal education beyond the undergraduate degree. Scholarships possess several unique benefits and are among the most desirable forms of financial assistance. They recognize certain merits and achievements and reward deserving candidates depending on them.

## How the right scholarship can benefit your career

Scholarships can benefit you and make big difference in your overall educational journey. They can enable you to be more discerning on how you want to spend your leisure time, since you have already secured money for your education. So overall, you can maximize your experience throughout your educational journey through service learning, volunteering work, and internships. Even if your scholarship amount is not too significant, you can still support yourself with it and can add meaning and value to your degree.

In the present times, many students graduate from college or complete their university studies with enormous student loans that sometimes limit their higher education. Since a scholarship doesn’t present the need for payback, students can easily focus on their careers instead of planning about how to repay debts. 

Scholarships remove certain financial barriers. Their impact smoothens out the educational journey towards accomplishing career goals. You can become an attractive hire if you have earned a prestigious merit-based scholarship. Employers understand the competitiveness of scholarships and consider them as valuable achievements.

Further, the reduction of financial concerns can give you added time to study with a relaxed mind. This can make learning enjoyable, which will automatically lead to better marks and knowledge retention. In this way, you can increase your chances to continue further higher studies.

In summary, when financial aid is necessary for a candidate, scholarship presents a beneficial and desirable form of financial aid."

Using a burner account for this so friends and family don’t get alarmed. 

Growing up I always knew what I wanted to do, which was work in the arts field professionally. Whether it be design, acting, props, really anything I was game for. And I even set myself up for it as best I could; got good grades, went to a good college, found as many opportunities as I could and actually got into a few movies by the time I was finishing college. But unfortunately when life decides to hit you it doesn’t hold its punches. Within a year of graduating and starting an internship with a theatre, I was faced with multiple deaths of family members and friends, complete loss of income from my family household, as well as being forced back into a deeply toxic (non-romantic familial) relationship that has aggravated my anxiety and depression to the point that I have to be heavily medicated just to survive. So I had to give up everything I spend over a decade working towards just to support myself and have healthcare. Got an over-full-time-but-only-pays-for-forty-hours-no-overtime-pay office job that offered insurance and slightly above minimum wage where I was working upwards of 60 hours a week running two departments completely on my own. Then every single person I had as an emotional safety net moved far enough out of state that i haven’t seen most of them in upwards of 5 years, meaning I was simply stuck with only toxicity. With housing the way it is I am stuck living with my family in a dead end job with nobody around me for comfort or friendship, while I watch everyone I love getting into big time television, movies, modeling, singing, essentially following their dreams and being able to live the life they want. Meanwhile I can’t even leave my job to try to find something else because I need the health insurance due to my medications I have to take for my mental health. I had a therapist but honestly she did more bad than good and ultimately ended up ghosting me completely after I asked to schedule an appointment because my only remaining Grandparent had passed. When she was seeing me she would essentially tell me to get over myself and stop acting like I’m a victim but honestly it’s been hard finding any motivation to keep going and it’s been even harder coming to terms with the fact that the way my life has played out I will most likely never feel truly happy for fulfilled. 

I’m getting really tired of just having all of these people in my life telling me to try to get back into the arts world and that I should quit my job to pursue it. It’s really bold of them to say that when they’re either being partially supported by their family or not dealing with any sort of medical situations that require them to have insurance. 

I’m sorry for ranting all of this out, I just feel like I’m reaching the end of my rope fast and wanted to see if anyone would have any advice for this situation outside of “get over it” and “just quit your job and do it it’s easy”

TLDR: life took a big ol’ shit on me and at this point I’ve run out of things I can do to make me remotely happy. Any advice?"

I'm currently in 11th grade, I just started my application process and by that I mean I took my IELTS exam(band 8) and Cambridge exam(level C2) and I also took my SAT(1400 score) and I am considering taking the MAT and/or Step 1 exams to prove my knowledge in maths, I also have a kindaa rich personal statement, with some national olympiads and medals earned. Enough humbleness 😆
But the truth is.. I don't know what universities to consider!
I prefer something.. open-minded! I want a Pure Mathematics degree but I would want the possibility to have optional modules later on within the years. I would rather prefer a city-based university, as I would want to live with my boyfriend once I'm in the UK, (or so we'll see!) although l won't mind living on campus. Also I want the possibility of future internship opportunities.

I wouldn't want anything from Oxbridge so don't suggest that. I prefer something mid-rank but still Russel League.
For now I consider 
1. University of Manchester
2. University of Sheffield
3. University of Liverpool
4. Imperial College of London
5. ??? Manchester Metropolitan/ University of Leeds

What tips would you have for me? I'm aware there is so many things which I don't know yet but that's why I decided to post this on this subreddit! Tysm!💞"

u6ekwb,1,2022-04-18,What Career Path to choose? Consulting/PM/PMM | Masters,Unhappy-Lifeguard-30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/u6ekwb/what_career_path_to_choose_consultingpmpmm_masters/,"I'm an upcoming Management graduate with an internship in top FMCG. [Sales Ops]. I'm currently applying for jobs and will probably end up in one of the following areas in the next 2 months:
- Sales [FMCG]
- Consultancy [Low Tier or Health/Edu sector] 
- Marketing [FMCG or Tobacco]
- Product [Ecommerce or Quick Commerce] 
- B2B Startup

× I couldn't get into MBB because I didn't know much about consulting
x Applying to sales cuz that's the only internship I got

Where I get in will define the start of my career. However, I plan to do a masters within the next year to improve job prospects (geographically). I'm unsure what to masters in: 
- Marketing
- Business Analytics
- Management 

My background: 
- Management degree ft. marketing, entrepeneurship, data courses. 
- Couldn't follow up with a CS minor, only got CS 100

My interest 
- Consulting
- Product Management
- Strategy
- Marketing

My personality and inclinations (?)
 
- I'm creative but also good at technical things.
- I'm mostly introverted so too much people-oriented roles are going to be taxing I assume. 

Closing thoughts: 
- UI/UX and coding fields seem appealing but I have no knowledge as of now and neither the degree to accompany. 
- FAANG seems like the shit and worth aspiring towards but would need a masters for that.
- I gotta balance what I can do with what I like and what would pay more


As you can guage, I'm a newbie, many things 'interest' me and I've been trapped in a circular thought loop about deciding the perfect career path for the last 3 months. The lack of direction has gotten exhausting so reaching out to learn from those who know more. I'd be grateful for any input."

While I have some working knowledge of these, but I have no real world experience and this is currently the only opportunity for a job to get experience to help me move forward. I have 2 years of school left so I have another summer to try and find an internship but don't want to pass up this opportunity hoping for one later.

I don't necessarily want to go back to school but feel like I am in too deep not to finish since I have been in school for 5 years, and I really just want to be done with school. I have taken a semester off before and I came back but I know it'll be harder a second time. The company says they will help pay for the rest of my schooling (with 2 year contract after I graduate) which would be a huge help financially and big part of why I feel like I should take it. 

Just looking for any advice on what you would do and consider. Thanks"
u6g1cf,0,2022-04-18,"As a junior (incoming senior), should I spend the summer practicing coding problems or apply for a kids coding camp?",SprainedShorts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u6g1cf/as_a_junior_incoming_senior_should_i_spend_the/,"i think i cannot get a SWE internship for the summer anymore since I dont feel confident Ill do well in any coding interview. I used to be a great programmer a few/couple years ago, I was very ahead. Made a lot of personal projects and I was very familiar with and knew a lot more than what I was learning, but I lost my edge, and I'm out of practice now like fat thor. since then I stopped caring, cheated on a lot of exams/assignments with friends, barely went to class, barely scraped by. 

surprisingly I did well in a first round coding interview for this company, and now I have a final coding interview in 10 days. I started practicing leetcode problems since 1 week ago, and I am grinding leetcode like crazy. I also previously finished an udacity course on datastrcutures and algorithms to help me catch up.  If I dont get this internship, I am considering applying for a kids coding camp position since they dont do coding interviews. Would I be able to work an entry level position with this experience alone? Is this a good idea? An alternative to a kids coding camp over the summer would be to continue applying to SWE internships now. if I dont get a SWE position for the summer then i can grind leetcode over the summer, catch up with practicing leetcode, and apply for a SWE internship for the following summer after I graduate college. Then, I apply for an entry level SWE position after that."

My friendship with an introverted guy who I secretly love was becoming more frutiful and fun since he was getting more comfortable (we've been friends for almost 3 years now). I would enjoy talking to him so much, and we were talking more frequently than before.

Time passed, the weather was getting slightly better, but no improvement in energy to do stuff. I got lazy, lethargic, annoyed at the work pending, but I was still happy and enjoying that ""good, vibrant"" phase of a friendship. I mean, if ur crush talks to you more often, you would be happier and enjoy every moment of it wldnt you? I would have random, mini breakdowns but that would be because of the uni workload and anxiety of what I have to do after this semester end. I am in my junior year so the pressure is high with all the options I have to search for post-graduate abroad and for internships in my current residential area. Life was shaky, but it was still alright.

Then comes mid of February, where everything started to fall apart. My friend became slightly cold and harsh, and since I was pissed off that day due to the reply which I wasn't expecting I didn't reply and left him on read. But, after talking it out to my friends, I realised I had to cool down and reply back as if nothing happened. Things with him were a little awkward, but it simmered down.   
However, my college situation was getting worse since I had midterms and I wasn't able to study due to being emotionally exhausted thinking about that dumb reply. MIdterms passed, but the vibes with him were still shaky. He was going through his own shit, was getting depressed, and is usually reserved and doesn't like to talk much about his problems, so i didn't know how to respond. 

It's April now, and my friendship with him is at such a crumbly stage. The vibrant, colourful times with him still stand to be cold, college is hitting harder and I'm barely hanging by a thread with all the assignments and projects being dumped on. I am emotionally and mentally exhausted. NOTHING IS GOING GREAT, and I have been crying out of the blue so much. I would burst out into tears randomly; during my rides  back home, in the Uber, in my room at night, or around friends. I feel distraught right now. I can't bear to look at my life right now. I can't lose myself, or my friend, or this semester. I love him enough to let him go. I can't afford to fail any course and repeat it. I can't, i really can't with life right now. And to make matters worse, I study in a toxic environment in my current college.

I just want it all to end soon. I just want the good times back so badly. I just want to be able to make it out alive. I just want to him to be alright and happy and warm again. I just want life to give me a break and just stop it with the slaps it's been giving me from the past couple of months. My heart is heavy, my mind is heavy, and I can't stop the tears from streaming down anymore. I feel like i am going to squeeze every ounce out of me if i go on like this. I just can't. I am so done."

u6gly3,26,2022-04-18,Software Engineer -&gt; Analyst. Is it the right call?,bertmackl1nfb1,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/u6gly3/software_engineer_analyst_is_it_the_right_call/,"I've been working as a software engineer in a service based company for a year now. Although I work on production support which requires minimal coding, I can safely say that I don't enjoy the minimum coding that I have to do. Believe me, I've tried my best. In college, I did contribute to a few projects and internships involving MERN stack. I've also tried to be regular at ""grinding"" leetcode for months now. However, I've realized I'm too dumb for coding. All the projects that I've done required very little original contribution from my side. Tbvh, most of the projects on my resume are plagiarised. I am good at learning stuff but I'm unable to develop logic on my own and build stuff. This reflects in my leetcode grind too. I can hardly connect the dots whenever I'm going through the solution in the discussions. I constantly feel stupid and frustrated at my production support job. I always had my doubt about the fact that I'm not cut out for coding but it is becoming stronger lately. 

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD so a lot of my struggles make sense now. I recently saw a post on this sub about someone with ADHD wondering about jobs in tech. A lot of folks mentioned about Business Analyst role. I can say that I'm fairly proficient in SQL and Excel. I've also dabbled with data visualization using pandas, numpy. I've also been doing this product analyst certification lately and I'm enjoying it so far. 

Would it be wise to switch from SE to Analyst role? I understand that analyst roles do not pay as handsomely as SE roles. I also want to understand the career trajectory of analysts in consultancies and product based companies. As much as I want to wash my hands odd extensive coding, I also dont want to work in a role that plateaus in terms of growth and money in a few years. Also, please note that I do not intend to pursue MBA in the future. 

I would love to know your opinions and suggestions."

After several hours, the path they use only seems to deteriorate the further they go; with Kaga on the left and Ystor on the right. But offering itself as a better sight to see is the sheer vastness of the forest they find themselves to be in. The twisting and winding of incredible branches and roots the size of entire trucks and even houses. 

Moving along the dirt road, so overtaken by nature which displays just how unused this path is and how it might even be forgotten infrastructure, Ystor seems to be the person struggling to navigate it as she constantly has to duck below the vegetation. Her human friend on the other hand, Kaga, struggles differently since he has to avoid the holes and bumpiness.

And from looking at him nearly trip over yet another bump in the dirt, Ystor asks, “How are you holding up?” 

“Fine.” He glances back at her. “And you?”

“Struggling,” the elf chuckles, “these damnable leaves keep getting in my eyes.”

”Mm.” He pushes a dead bush out of the way, letting it get lost further in the greenery.

Despite the irreparable road being so full of the long leaves, the two make due with their situation. Ystor does so by filling up the monotony with her curiosity that seems to leak out more and more.

“By the way,” the elf starts, “I’m not sure if it’s rude to ask or not but I’ve been wondering about your augmentations. Or, your supposed augmentations since I’m not exactly certain if you do have any.”

“I do possess modifications. Elaborate, though.” The man says while hopping over a noticeable dip in the dirt.

“Well, where do I start?” She mostly directs the question to herself but leaves it to be answered either way. “Hmm, sorry I’m trying not to sound inconsiderate or anything.”

“It is fine. I don’t mind.”

“Right, then… actually, I’ve never once seen you without your helmet. Wait, let me guess, is it a classified thing like how it usually is with U-Max and their assets?”

The man is quiet for a moment. “It is not prohibited but you will be disappointed.”

“Disappointed? How?”

“A mask. That will stay on.” Firmness resides in the second part of his response.

“May I see?” She asks anyway. But as she does so, she moves a long branch out of the way. Another branch near it—on Kaga’s side of the road—whips back and right into her companion’s face.

“At a more opportune time.” He says after Ystor makes a sound akin to a snort and apologizes.

After clearing her system of the recent incident, the elf looks up and notices just how red the sky has become. It must be just after the golden hour as she interprets the colors. She can’t see the sun however, blocked by the tall trees and the density of the forest.

“Huh, I’d say it’s an opportune time.” Ystor states as she points up.

Kaga follows the gesture. “So it is.” It would seem he understands what the elf is getting at.

Ystor looks around trying to find an open area, staying still which prompts Kaga to simply stand guard with his rifle at the ready. She hums to herself as she looks through the relatively open area they find themselves in with huge roots acting like natural walls, seeing not many good spots until her eyes lay on a certain area. 

A flat area with minimal shrubs and bushes covered in the darkening shadow of a tree root seems suitable to her. To get to it, all they have to do is go downhill on the right side of the road and step over a few pesky plants. No less than twenty or thirty seconds.

“There,” she says, “that’s where we'll rest. Good coverage and open to spot any of the wildlife big enough to see us as a meal.”

“Mm.” Is the only noise Kaga makes as he nods in agreement. He begins to make his way there.

Ystor is quick to be beside him.

The duo now resides in the opening. Kicking a dead thin tree off a rock, the human of the two looks at the elf and nods. The elf grins and praises herself.

“So,” the woman rests her hands on her hips as she studies their environment, “let’s get some wood then, yeah?”

When she looks at her friend, she sees him with some dead wood already. He uses his foot to create an open spot on the ground before tossing the wood on it and spreading it out. From there, Ystor takes care of the rest by using her ability to create white fire. It isn’t long before they have a fine flame going with minimal smoke rising.

But noticing the more prominent hue of the sky, Ystor points out the golden-orange light they’d expected to arrive. Her companion lets off the noise he usually makes to show acknowledgement. And to her surprise, he even comments on the sky giving off a warm feeling.

“I will share my ration with you.” Kaga is already on one knee with his rifle laying next to him and a pack in front of him. He reaches into it and pulls out an MRE.

“You’re sure?” The elf asks as she looks for a place to sit. She ends up finding a flat rock and moves it closer to the fire. Being cold isn’t a desirable condition she wants to be in.

“Yes.” He tears open an olive-green packet with Temenese words on it; probably another factory item produced in his homeland. Taking off his right glove reveals tanned skin but compared to this natural flesh is the existence of metal spanning across the top of his hand and onto his palm.

Ystor almost marvels at that, seeing actual augmentations on a person for once. Instead of the all-flesh skin she would see on her fellow elven coworkers, her human counterpart has metal built into his body. A fascinating concept to the elf, but not exactly one she would embrace herself.

Plus, another thing to marvel at and think about besides the beach they were on just hours ago.

“Here. Take it.” Having taken a sizable piece of dried meat out of the packet, he holds it in the palm of his hand.

“Thank you, Kaga.” The elf smiles and nods at him while he simply nods. She holds the dried meat between her fingers but continues to gaze at his hand.

Soon enough she has another sight to gaze at. That being the man taking off his helmet, his unoccupied hand interacting with something out of her view. Of course, she knows all she will see is a mask but that doesn’t stop her from imagining.

But now with the helmet in his lap, Kaga returns the gaze. His angled brown eyes under thick black eyebrows meet her purple ones. Besides his eyes, the only other part of his face that shows is his brown-pink lips.

However, as the elf looks into the man’s eyes she can’t help but notice something off with them. As if they were unnatural-

“Privately made visual optics,” his lips curve upwards slightly, “from the company.” His voice, no longer under the filter of the helmet, is accented and almost jarring to the elf because of the stark difference.

“Do you know how they work?” Ystor asks, the dried meat still in her hands.

“Mm, I do not know that unfortunately. Only that it has to do with nerves connecting and such.”

“Oh, well that’s fine. But what did they do with your old eyes?”

“Preserved. Courtesy of U-Max storage assets.”

“Wow.” The elf rests her chin on her hand. “You’re able to get them back at any time?”

The human chuckles, his teeth showing slightly. “I do not know. I never thought that was a viable option.”

Sharing in the slight laughter, Ystor leans back—she also takes a bite out of the meat. Her joyful attitude quickly comes to a halt as she visually cringes at the taste.

“Bleh!” She smacks her lips together with a crinkled face. Wondering why the dried meat tastes so weird, she directs a question the man’s way. “You eat this, Kaga?”

“That’s correct.” He says, taking a bite out of his own dried meat. The crunch makes his elven friend shiver.

“What even is this?” Eyeing the dried meat and the human at the same time, her question demands an answer.

“Nutritional slabs. Compacted meat.” A smirk appears on his mouth and his eyes squint. The man practically radiates a smug aura. “Eat up.”

Wiping her mouth away with any crumbs—opposite of Kaga just licking the ones off his lips—she takes a second to fully register the look before her own grin forms. “You're an actual piece of ass.”

“Meh.” Kaga shrugs and takes another bite of the dried meat.

“You knew it would taste like dung didn’t you?” Her expression mirrors that of an angry elven woman. But the humor is still clear.

He nods, chewing on his piece with a seemingly permanent smirk.

“Not even a warning.” She chuckles. Hesitantly but eventually, she consumes another part of the terrible-tasting meat that the man calls food.

Brief quietness possesses the atmosphere between the two of them before Ystor decides to satisfy more of her curiosity of the Temenese man. The man, who she has worked with for the past year, seems to be more than meets the eye.

“I want to know, how did you come to work under U-Max?” She ignores the taste of the dried meat as much as she can while she takes a bite. “Cuz you and Hirin are the only two I’ve ever met and even then, you guys never really told anyone anything.”

Kaga finishes chewing and swallows then answers her. “No one ever really asked.” He chuckles and continues on.

“Are you aware of the law in the NPR that states every male must enlist by seventeen?”

Ystor raises an eyebrow at the fact. It had definitely not been one she knew. “No, but I’m assuming that’s when you enlisted?”

He nods. “This was when the NPR and the Royal Monarchy had very extreme conflict. It became global when those Union pigs wanted to film it.”

Ignoring his evident distaste for the Northern Union across the world, she recalls her early teens. On a TV she shared with her sisters they watched an international news network; she distinctly remembers viewing Union commenters discussing the conflict and showing footage of firefights. That was over twelve years ago.

So if Kaga was seventeen around that time, then that must mean he’s, “Twenty-nine? You’re twenty-nine?”

A ‘so-so’ hand gesture comes from him. “Moving on. During a battle near Trikasa Bay, I was in a shrine house. I remember killing about six or seven Monarchy soldiers.”

“That many?” Ystor’s face drops at that. While she won’t deny that she has taken lives before and under the protection of the law—she even killed a few mercenaries at the castle—it’s a bit harder to digest the information. These soldiers that Kaga had killed were not money-thirsty murderers but instead men who been sent to the frontline on the notion they were the good guys.

She’s never had a positive opinion of war.

“And more. But back to it now, I was preventing enemy movement on the open road. I was supposed to hinder troops, not vehicles. I was unprepared for an enemy tank to blow up the shrine with me in it.”

He takes a sip from his bottle that he had pulled out at some point in their conversation. The elf is focused on the man, waiting for more.

“I was knocked out but was brought back by my augmentations stimulating my body. The first thing I saw were my mangled legs and the morning sky.” He curses softly in his own language and shakes his head with a plastered grin. “Then I saw my left arm. I had landed on it and bone was sticking out. Pure adrenaline and stimulants kept me up.”

“As stupid as it was, I flipped myself over and started crawling. I didn’t get far but whatever was happening, the NPR was winning. My countrymen grabbed me and I ended up in a hospital.”

He sips from his bottle. “I was bedridden for the few days after that. Then, that’s when these men in business suits approached me. They told me I was the perfect candidate for their program and that I could go back into the field.”

A sigh escapes his lips. Ystor takes this as an opportunity to ask a question.

“U-Max?”

“Yes. Scouts.” He rubs his neck. “They repaired my body. Gave me functional legs. Reinforced my arms despite only my left being broken. And made me stronger.”

“Now,” he continues, “what you see is the product of U-Max. From a soldier to a personal operator to be hired out to clients who want the finest security.”

Kaga smiles to show his happiness, but his eyes are downcast. He takes a bit from his nearly-finished MRE.

It takes Ystor a second to fully register the whole story. But when she does, she looks at the fire with wide eyes. Her mouth is slightly agape.

“And you?” The human gets her attention again. “How did you end up as a Junior Captain for the Rysmar estate?”

The elf collects herself for a moment before answering. “Well believe it or not, Kaga, but I actually didn’t even want to be on this career path.”

He tilts his head. A gesture to show his confusion.

“I actually wanted to be a food scientist, a person who basically works to make the processing of food better so as to ensure the result is healthy and safe for the population.”

The human’s eyes widen at the confession. “A respectable and high-paying occupation. Why that?”

“Mmhm. Several figures.” She rubs her hands and sighs with a smile. “And before I answer that, I want to know your prediction on my upbringing.”

Kaga leans back to readjust himself before straightening out to fix his posture. “A sister of many in a family under the Sentinel Command. Raised properly and set out to achieve good deeds.”

“Really?” The elf is surprised. “You thought that?”

“Yes. But please, continue.”

“Huh, well, you were right about the ‘sister of many’ part. I’m the oldest of eight sisters.” She crosses her arms.

The man interjects. “Fertility is a common trait between elves and the Temenese. It only makes sense.”

Giving him a weird look, the elf snorts at that. She continues on.

“But about the Sentinel Command, nope. Far from it actually. I was raised by farmers.” Ystor proudly says.

“Hm,” Kaga leans forward, “my second guess.”

“Yep! But anyways, I grew up wanting to continue the farm and even expand it. Then, my father gave me this magazine about the process of altering the genetics of plants and from there my curiosity grew. It grew up until the point that my father took notice and, with my mother, decided he would send me to college so I could become a food scientist.”

The human is silent as he gives her water for her probably dry tongue. She accepts it and expresses her gratitude.

“Sorry if this is taking too long,” she scratches her head in embarrassment, “I can just get to the point if you want me to?”

“No, no it’s fine. Please, continue.” He gestures for her to do so and even smiles a little.

Ystor returns the expression.

“Everyone pooled their funds—even some of our closest neighbors—to send me to college so I could become a scientist. So fast-forward a couple years and now I’m attending Riquell, a college just west of the city of Altumin. Everything’s going fine too, I’m on point with my academics, established connections, even got on the good side of most of my professors.”

The elf slouches enough for the human to take notice but he doesn’t say anything. “Then, on a weekday where I’m studying in the library, this absolutely random attack occurred on the campus. It was an entire army of void creatures that somehow went undetected.”

“A lot of people died that day. And I was nearly one of them but I was able to run away to hide in one of the campus bunkers that were designed for these assaults. We were holed up in there for seven or eight hours before the Sentinels cleared them out.” Ystor sighs. “When I saw the damage and the dead… I couldn’t stand it.”

“It was only a few days afterwards that a recruiter for the Sentinel Command contacted me. I still haven’t told my family as they think I’m still working towards becoming a scientist.” She leans back and looks at the darkening sky, pausing for a few seconds. “I served for about three years before I was discharged; I sent my paychecks back home that whole time under the guise that I was working for a paid internship. After that, I looked into getting another job.”

She sighs slowly and pats her thighs. “That’s when I saw an advertisement for the Rysmar’s estate. It was you who escorted me in. And from there, you know the rest.” 

Ystor referenced the fact that she only worked for them for a whole year. The man nods slowly at that.

Relative silence passes; Kaga with his munching from finishing the rest of his MRE, Ystor hunched over with her feet tapping against the ground, and the crackling fire.

It is peaceful, yes, but the elf knows just how temporary this will be. Because for all she knows, this will be the only night they get to relax comfortably without any immediate threats. Anything like the foraging insektas could jump them, even mirovi bandits with less than notable intentions—she doesn’t even want to imagine what fighting a mirovi would be like.

She appreciates the moment. Being alive.

Having the ability to rest and recuperate. Interacting with someone she considers a friend, even if most of his words are grunts. Unfortunately, something her fellow elves would not have the same luxury of. She can’t even comprehend what those mercenaries will do with the bodies. Burn them? Cut them up and sell the parts? Leave them to rot?

It doesn’t sit right with her at all. Making herself frown and crinkle her brows at the thought. Just wrong. So much more could have been done to save them. She could have done more had she been trusted to do what she was employed to do.

“You’re angry?” Kaga speaks. He licks his fingers.

“Hm?” The sudden question interrupts her depressing thoughts. “Why ask that?” 

“You’re face.” He makes an odd motion with his now-gloved hand. “It’s all scrunched up.” 

Upon hearing that the elf’s face relaxes, the contours of her facial muscles disappear as she does so.

“Oh, just… thinking back on the castle again.” Sorrow is present in her tone, almost seeping into guilt.

Kaga doesn’t say anything but he does keep his gaze on her. Ystor has her eyes on the fire.

“A lot more could have escaped.” She remembers seeing her elven sisters-in-arms being defeated by that red-headed one. Then those impossible weapons the mercenaries used to break easily through the guard’s magi shields; like a hot knife through butter.

A pause occurs before she continues. “I can’t help but think that… well, so much more could have been done and… And that if I wasn’t excluded from yours and the Captain’s communications, many more people could have gotten out alive. Of course, I understand casualties are unavoidable but what we just escaped from literally hours ago—it was a siege. A massacre.”

The elf shakes her head. Frustration present on her face.

After some silence, Kaga speaks again. “You’re feeling guilt.”

“Yeah. I am.” She recalls her brief encounter with that redheaded elf. “It’s… it’s a weight on my mind that’s starting to get quite heavy.”

Her last words were laced with sarcasm. 

“Sadness too?”

“Mhm. Sadness too.” The elf chuckles bitterly. She stares off into the growing darkness of their surroundings, the shadows of the forest growing dominant as the light fades away. But then she averts her eyes to her companion. “You know, we’ve gotten considerably closer these past few hours.”

“Mm.” He grunts and nods. “So we have.”

“I… I don’t know why exactly I’m confining to you at the rate I have, but… I’m okay with that.” She smiles at him with eyes that seem close to closing. “I consider you a friend.”

Kaga, who looks a little taken aback from his widened eyes and raised posture, doesn’t say anything. But after a few moments of collecting himself, he responds. “I am… glad to have that role.”

“By the way,” her smile turns into a subtle grin, “you’re a good listener but really bad at responding.”

The look on the visible parts of the man’s face, having turned flat already, shares her expression. He gives her a thumbs up. “I apologize.”

Silence takes over once more with the fire being the main noise. The human of the two breaks it.

“I will take watch for the night.” He grabs the rifle that lays on the ground.

“You’re sure?” The elf perks up at his sudden and self-decided decision.

“Yes. Get some sleep.” He firmly says as he keeps his rifle in a resting position. “Daylight will come in the next eight hours or so.”

“Eight hours?” She questions him while she takes off her top, revealing a solid black undershirt. After doing so she bundles up the jacket uniform into a temporary pillow. “How’d you get that time table?”

“My helmet’s clock.”

“Huh, I didn’t… expect your armor to have more functions.” Ystor lays on the dry ground.

“Mm.” The man nods.

“Wake me up halfway through the night then, I’ll cover the rest.”

Kaga doesn’t respond to that for a few moments, only gazing at her, before finally nodding slowly. To the elf, this is a satisfying answer.

“Rest well… friend.”

She smiles then turns her back to face the flames."
u6gqjw,20,2022-04-18,New Grad Looking to Go Into Bioinformatics,WolfofReach,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/u6gqjw/new_grad_looking_to_go_into_bioinformatics/,"Hello!

I am graduating with a BSc in Biology in May and was looking at going into Bioinformatics. The problem with this is everything I did in High school and College were geared towards going into Veterinary medicine. This year I finally figured out this isn't really what I want to do with my life anymore, but I feel kind of stuck. I've always been a computer nerd and have self-taught myself several languages and have worked with statistics and R while working towards my Bio undergrad.

I feel like Bioinformatics would be a good fit for me, but I don't know where to start. I'm currently taking a gap year while I decide if a masters in Bioinformatics is right for me. I am not a fan of school and had a horrible time in undergrad (still made it out with a great GPA, etc. though) so I really do not want to continue school if I don't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my real question is what can I do during this year to either get a job in the field, expand my knowledge in the field, or prepare for a masters program. I have applied to several internships but have been turned away because I have no proof of any computer science proficiency. I'm also brushing up on my Python and C++ knowledge, but don't really know where to go from there. Advice?"
u6gvi9,4,2022-04-18,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (4/18/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/u6gvi9/weekly_job_qa_thread_4182022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 118th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I can go to work whenever I want and be absent as long as I inform my supervisor beforehand (was able to be absent for one week straight because of exam week).  the workload is okay naman and can be done before the deadline. 

also, what's the better choice? should i continue with my internship or just use my time to self-study programming in python?

u6hkmr,503,2022-04-18,An important lesson for those graduation and first entering industry or on your first internship.,solrose,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/u6hkmr/an_important_lesson_for_those_graduation_and/,"*Posted this on my LinkedIn profile and wanted to share it here as well as I think this is an important thing to keep in mind.*

.

A lesson for all of those soon to be graduate engineering students entering industry or those ready to enter their first internship . . .

As engineering students, we often view liberal arts majors as ""lesser"". Similarly, we often view the technicians or maintenance guys as ""lesser"" as well since they didn't go to college at all. However, this is so incredibly wrong for two primary reasons.

First, they perform other roles that you need in order to ensure a successful project and to run a company successfully.

The people who run your office, the finance department, the production team, the sales &amp; marketing folks etc are all crucial parts of your success overall.

Sure, they may not be able to do the design &amp; calcs you can do, but your engineering input would have no where to go without a full business which is what they help create.

Second, these are people that can TEACH YOU things that you never learned in engineering school. That ""simple"" technician, maintenance guy, or equipment installer knows so much about the inner workings of the device you are designing.

You may be able to run calculations to specify the right equipment, but engineering school doesn't teach you about all of the other considerations that may make one piece of equipment better in one situation versus another. Additionally, you learn nothing about how to pick &amp; place equipment for optimal maintenance.

These people aren't ""lesser"" and you aren't on some elevated platform.

Rather, we are all part of a house of cards.

Remove anyone and the whole thing falls down. So make sure to show respect to everyone and soak up all the knowledge they can pass along to help you on your journey"

I was unable to look for work for a few months due to having surgery and then having to recover, but I have been looking for jobs for the last few months now since I have fully healed up.

The search hasn't gone well, and I have decided that I would like to go back for my Master's degree in CE or a related field. I was wondering what the most sought out and well versed degree typically is in this field- Ideally I would be able to pursue this degree online, but I know that complicates things. Alternatively it would be in my area, but I'm not willing to disclose that online. I'm also looking into internship programs that would pay me enough money to move out, as my living situation is not really the best and I would need to support myself. I should also mention that covid really tanked my GPA and I'm not sure how to really recover from that because my university really didn't work with me.

The whole ""how to search for these programs"" thing has never really been explained to me and I'm struggling to do the research by myself, so I wanted to reach out in the hopes that I might be able to be given a few pointers about how I could do this more efficiently- even though I am very aware that this question makes me look like a newbie with no idea of where to go (partially because I am-)

So

Yeah

Any feedback or help would be appreciated

u6mfsn,5,2022-04-18,Every college student's dilemma.,SpookyBlob,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/u6mfsn/every_college_students_dilemma/,"I've always wanted to do engineering since I was a kid, when I graduated high school with a 4.0 I got a good scholarship to what I thought was my dream school. Now I'm a Junior in college, and by next fall I will be a Senior studying naval architecture &amp; marine engineering. I have worked at four different internships across the US and I've lost all my interest in this industry because the workforce is outdated and out of touch and nobody wants to change that. My school doesn't let me change majors, but I've really wanted to transfer colleges and change majors to computer science because it's what all my friends back home are doing and I really enjoyed coding in high school because of how intuitive it was. My mom keeps telling me to finish this major and join the workforce after graduation and maybe go back to college after then, but the longer I'm at school the more distant I feel from the courses and the less motivation I have. 

I've started telling everyone about this and I really don't know what to do. I could suck it up until I work a few years then get my MBA and take coding classes at the same time, or just start taking classes out of the gates (but I don't think most of my classes will qualify for a transfer and I'll have to retake a lot of them.) I have big ambitions but seeing so much time go to waste is depressing."

In my company there is an opportunity to make a full time contract but the HR told me that based on my situation we can't switch to it. I don't need the student resident benefits any more. What I need is to have a blue card while continuing my MSc. I know some of my friends made that in other companies. But I don't know why my department's HR telling me that, she had many conflicts with me while doing the internship contract for me, which means that she doesn't aware with German law perfectly because they don't hire a lot of international people. 

So, Is it legally possible ? 
What is the Law provision should I check for ?

Thanks in advance.

Update: I have already a bachelor of computer science.
She said if you need a blue card you have to deregister from your master program."

I am aspiring to become a Cloud Engineer after I have completed my degree in Computer Science.

I’ve spent a lot of time browsing for internships today, but it appears many are closed now. I am a first-year student in the UK located in a “non-tech” small city so there aren’t any local opportunities either. I’ve probably left it too late as it seems they open applications around a year ahead - at least I’ll know for next year.

Would you say it’s best to spend this summer working on certifications (such as AZ-900), or would you say something different would be a better use of my time? I understand my degree alone won’t be enough, so I’m looking for opportunities to help propel me into the field."
u6pswv,2,2022-04-18,"It's been two years since I've graduated with a B.A. in English, and I've yet to find a full-time job. Should I go back to school for an associate's or certificate in marketing?",pomegranatejello,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/u6pswv/its_been_two_years_since_ive_graduated_with_a_ba/,"I graduated with a degree in English and a concentration in journalism. I graduated with a little internship experience at a local newspaper, along with some clips from my student paper. I realized a bit too late in the game I didn't actually want to work for a newspaper, having been fairly naive and impressionable, but my advisor gave me the impression there's a lot of transferability with journalism and fields like marketing, copyediting, content writing and communications. However, I've yet to find a job or freelance opportunity in these fields, I think largely due to a lack of experience or relevant samples. I'm caught in the paradox of needing experience to gain experience in an entry level job or gig. 

I feel pretty lost, unconfident and demoralized in general regarding my career search. I spent a while without applying anywhere my first year after graduating due to struggles with family, mental illness and the challenges of the early pandemic. While I could still definitely up my endurance sending out more applications, I've sent quite a few out and it's started to feel like a pointless chore. I'm still working my retail job from last summer, which I was okay with for a while, but I need more money and feel like it's high time I moved on.

I'm thinking about going back for an associate's degree or certificate in marketing to fill in those gaps and get more relevant samples. However, this is obviously a big drain on time and money and I'd hate to go for more schooling and debt if it's not really going to get me further ahead (I haven't had to pay loans back yet, but it's obviously coming up). Maybe I'm approaching my job search wrong. What are your thoughts? I know it's ultimately my decision, but it helps to hear other perspectives."

Problem with intern is that I only have a 3 years old A level cert with very amateur python knowledge. Lots of intern appln I found requires X proficient skills and knowledge or 1 yr experience. Then again I don't really have a direction planned out if I were to chill at home for 3 months.

I'm grateful to have two things to choose between now, all of a sudden. Because these are different levels of jobs (associate engineer &gt; intern) , I'm just conflicted.

Company A is a well known company,  and offering the associate engineering position. The position itself seems pretty interesting but the work hours are extremely early, long, and with lots of OT expected, all 100% in the clean-room. Like a start-up without the worries of it collapsing. I've never been an early bird, but it's possible I could change? All of the people are ready to teach me from the ground up, and everyone looks seriously pumped for their jobs.

Company B is the 6 month internship, is a known company but only outside of the US, and this is a very new branch in the US as a R&amp;D site. It's a very small team, but works like a start-up without the overwork of a start-up. The biggest thing for me is that, not only can I build and test all sorts of things, but also actually see it in action, so rather than a cog in the wheel like a regular engineering job, I can try out proto types on people. I'll be able to actually get to know my coworkers too.

A's culture feels more corporate, but because of its fast-paced work, I feel like I could really learn alot. I'm a little worried about getting too niched into an industry I might not like, and the general work-life balance of a crazy schedule cooped up in a cleanroom.B's culture feels more like family, I think I'll learn alot too, but as a research place, I won't likely get a permanent position. No guarantee I'll find my next job soon, But I feel that I would get a higher starting salary after internship B, than with what I would get with just A now. Searching for similar jobs in indeed/linkedin, though, I don't see much job description similarity for internship B, so that is a little worrisome.

The most important values for me are work-life balance (I will work as hard as possible, but I also know I burn out much faster than usual), and being able to learn as much as I can to securing a full-time regular job. Please let me know your thoughts. I appreciate it, if you read through to here."

**Thanks to everyone who clicked in, all help counts!**

I\`m from China and I want to get a master's in the US and work there.

I have a very low GPA (WES 2.5), a beachlor\`s degree in CS, currently working in a Fortune 500 US company in China as an IT consultant, no OT, mainly focused on SAP, graduated for one and a half years, got a 300k annual package before tax（CNY）

Due to some personal reasons, I wanted to study for a master's degree in the United States and stay there. (the reasons will not be repeated in this article, and I also thank you for your advice and support). When I was in college, I had a lot of fun and my grade point boomed, so I had to work for 2 years and then tried to apply.

I also know that my situation is hardly able to get enrollment, so when I applied, I planned to apply for both MIS and CS. Now I just want to ask about the situation of these two industries in the United States. Although the share of traditional IT in China is small, the salary is still acceptable, and many foreign companies allow WLB. In the states, the situation may not be the same. My language cannot compete with the native language, and there are a lot of very competitive Indian friends.. . So I want to post and ask you to give me some advice

**for me**

**MIS/Traditional IT/IT Consulting:**

***pros :***

1. It matches my resume and work experience very well, which is a giant help for me, who has very rubbish standardized scores.
2. After all, I have done some work and learned something in my work. In university, I was basically just playing around, fucking off...wasting my life
3. Personally, I prefer to communicate and deal with people, and I don’t like to engage in technology purely by myself.

***cons:***

1. I think I have good communication and expression skills, but it is still very hard to compete with the local people.
2. The pay may be much worse? And it's a bit like the sunset industry, compared to the Internet.
3. I feel that the industry is relatively saturated, and most American companies want to hire seniors. NG may only go to the Indian companies like Infosys, tata, or something. And for AC, I personally don't like it much due to some rumors from my colleague in China.

**CS/Internet:**

***pros:***

1. I really had this professional degree, although I didn't learn much in my uni
2. I have the interests, and there is a strong desire to pick up the old CS stuff I once learned
3. High salary, relatively more job opportunities, and universal working ability.

***cons:***

1. The most important thing is the admission problem. Although I do have a CS degree, the internship and RPA are the only connections in my CV
2. Compared with the IT consulting industry, I have no particular preference. I like both of them. But I can surely handle consulting faster since I have some experience.

u72pld,2,2022-04-19,"Waking up lonely, empty and purposeless in my late twenties",Lord_Gooseduck,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/u72pld/waking_up_lonely_empty_and_purposeless_in_my_late/,"First Reddit post here, hope it's in the right subreddit, not too chaotic or hard to read (English isn't my mother tongue).

I (28M) have been switching between depressive state and neutral state for the last few years. 

To give some context, I have left my country (France) to work in my dream company in Germany in 2020. I started my job from home and I'm still working 100% home office to this day. Because of the lockdowns and restricted possibilities (and probably my German level stuck at B1 since I'm working in English), I barely made any new friend (I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends there from an internship I had done earlier). For the same reasons, my girlfriend who followed me couldn't find a job and meet people either, so eventually we broke up in summer 2021 and she went back to France. 

Spending day after day alone in the same room, I realised little by little that my job wasn't so great to the point it was draining my energy and motivation. It wasn't just the lockdown situation, I just didn't enjoy what I was doing. That's when I first asked to myself the question ""what do I want to do with my life?"". So far, I had only followed the steps without thinking. School, university, landing jobs, that's it. I already could feel that something was wrong, but I couldn't put words on it. I used to think it was the company, or the specific project I was working on, or maybe I just needed something else in my life, money, or someone, etc. Now, I knew that even my dream company wasn't enough. I still wasn't getting any motivation or energy, and I came to the conclusion that I had to change things. 

I watched countless Youtube videos about how to find your purpose or dream job, but none really helped. Then I thought to myself : ""Ok, maybe I don't have a dream job and that's ok, many people find happiness elsewhere, on their freetime"". And I looked at my life and saw I had no passion. Just a few hobbies here and there that felt like losing time, like videogames (I used to dedicate all my freetime to videogames when I was studying and I was truly enjoying playing back then, but now I only play from time to time and don't even enjoy them that much anymore). I'm interested in many things, on the surface, but I never go deeper. It's like I'm scared to commit to anything, by fear of missing out something else.

That's when I started to doubt, question all my life choices (or in my case, non-choices), and lose hope. Is my life just going to be working a draining 9 to 5 to survive until I retire? How come I have no passion, no real interest? Am I just an empty shell? If I'm that boring, how can I connect to people, how will I ever find a partner? Will I spend my life sad and alone?

I'm fortunate enough to have a few very good old friends who I can speak openly to, and a great psychologist. With their support, I overcame my darkest thoughts and I took the decision to leave my current job. With my savings, I will take a few months to travel and volunteer, and also take some time to rest. That's the only solution I could come up with to escape depression. As for what will happen next, I don't know yet. I will get another job in another place, and I'm dreading to fall back in the same situation as before after a few weeks. I see people around me achieving goals, planning and completing projects, building relationships, settling with their partners. And at 28, I haven't achieved much, and my life doesn't make sense when I look back. It's like I just woke up from a long slumber, and at 28 I'm asking myself questions that I should have asked in my teens / early twenties.

Can anyone here relate? What do you think I could/should do to not to fall back in the depression loop, and find happiness with or without a purpose? If you have any suggestion, personal experience or resource to share, I would appreciate that a lot. 

Thank you"

I'm a pre-marketing major and I don't like how the business classes are set up. In my opinion, the R.E.A.L classes are a waste of time/money since there are no lectures and 5 mandatory labs. I live three hours away from UCF, so sometimes I feel like I came to Orlando for nothing. It's nearly impossible to get an advising appointment, and even when I go to walk-in advising I am not able to be advised. Also, I feel like it might be more difficult to find good internship opportunities here. I haven't heard anything completely positive about UCF's business program. I'm mostly considering staying at UCF for my friends, sorority, and a big campus experience. I have made a lot of friends here, and a lot of my friends are going here next year so I don't want to feel like I made the wrong decision if I transfer. I also enjoy being on a big college campus. I mainly want to transfer because of the unorganized business program; it kind of feels like a waste of money and I feel that it might be difficult to grow my career here.

On the other hand, I've heard that FAU's business program/marketing major is really good. It is also closer to where I live so it may be more convenient for me since I can manage a job/internship better. I'm hesitant about transferring because I'm afraid that I won't make many friends at FAU due to not being able to re-join Greek life.

I don't know what to do, I'm extremely conflicted so I'd greatly appreciate any advice! Thank you!"

About my job: I’m learning a ton here, definitely a great place to grow as I am allowed to use very popular tools in the field( eg. Splunk, Fortinet, etc). The pay is very good for my age. However my team is constantly letting me know I’m gonna have to get up to speed soon, I can do most of the work now, just not projects. My team certainly isn’t toxic, it’s just that they expect me to pick up everything very soon and I don’t know if I can do that. Also good to note that they all work remote and I’m on site.

Personally it’s crossed my mind to leave in a month or two to find a job with better pay, a much less strict environment, and remote. As a contractor I’m essentially treated as less than an employee.

I have a bachelor's degree from a decent technical university and have been getting interview requests from FAANG companies on LinkedIn but I'm not sure if I want to go in that direction.

For one, I am a decent developer but I wouldn't describe myself as 'excellent' or 'talented' at it. I'm not very fast at all and I still make mistakes of all kinds.  You might argue that's because I only have 6 months of full-time experience but ultimately I don't think I have the cognitive qualities required to be exceptional in this particular field. Most likely would struggle at a ""sink or swim"" type company (at least at my current skill level). In addition to this, I enjoy my current work-life balance: most weeks are capped at 40 hrs. Probably would not enjoy a competitive work environment where I'm expected to be working 60+ hrs. Therefore, I'm not sure I'd fit in at a FAANG company (could be wrong). I like software development but I don't want it to consume my whole life: I prefer that it'd stay a 'job'.

Within a year or so I want to be switching jobs and obviously, I want to go 'up'.  Between my past internships and a current full-time job, I have 3 years of experience so I should be fine in getting interviews. Here are my questions:

\- Where can I get a significant pay boost where I wouldn't be tossed into a ""sink-or-swim"" 50-80 hr week environment? 

\- What pay range should I be aiming for? 

\- Am I right to be adverse to FAANG/startup/similar jobs? 

\- Should I be seeking additional training at this stage besides leetcode? (Not sure my current job prepares me very well for high caliber positions).

**Background:**

A\* A\* A\* A in UK A-levels, including economics. I believe this to be a 4.0/4.0GPA when converted from UK to US. I also have 4.0/4.0 GPA in my GCSEs, but I doubt they matter.

Currently reading Chemical Engineering (MEng) at a world top 10 university (can't say which university or it'll give me away) - hopefully on track for a 1st this year. Looking to take a second degree when I graduate in Mathematical / Quantitative Finance (MSci).

Have experience in an investment fund from the previous summer.

Currently actively managing a portfolio of my own and have made \~130% this year trading options and futures, looking to run it full time when I break up for summer in a couple of months. In addition to this, much of my summer will be focused on fully understanding the financial markets.

**Questions:**

Will it matter that I'm not directly doing a finance / business degree?

Is finance the best Analyst Internship route for me if I'm looking to go into trading?

When's the best time to submit my application?

Any tips on what I should do over the summer to increase my chances of getting accepted?

I got a job offer from an IT company. The company provides a three year internship, during which you get training on their system, rules, methods, etc. They technically charge for the training you receive, which comes to an equivalent of about $7000. This debt gets erased monthly and if you complete the internship then the debt gets removed completely.

My issue is that I don't know if I will be around for three years. I have a plan to move abroad. If all goes to plan, then I will end up a couple of thousand dollars in real debt, which I would need to pay back before the last day of my contract. On the other hand, I don't have a formal degree in this field so job hunting has been tough and it's taken me 6 months just to get this offer.

u7buje,1,2022-04-19,ADHD Evaluation Came Back 'Negative' for ADHD,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u7buje/adhd_evaluation_came_back_negative_for_adhd/,"So, I'm 34 year old male, and as many here will be familiar with, I got an ADHD evaluation with a multi-hour interview, some testing, a questionnaire for me and my wife, etc. 

I finally get this report that's just a tad longer than three pages that says that I don't have ADHD but I do meet the criteria for ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"". 

To some degree, I can see why I may have some anxiety, but it is a little frustrating that they feel comfortable giving me that ""diagnosis"", with much less testing, while saying nothing for ADHD when I certainly described having a good many symptoms. And this guy (who was a nice enough guy) honestly jumped right on the anxiety thing practically before we talked *at all* about ADHD, before he'd asked me even one specific question about it, I remember the moment he was like ""oh okay, I waana come back to that"". I feel like he kinda got it in his head really early and maaaybe had a little bias toward it (I think he's, like, an intern and then it was reviewed by a PhD/Supervisor). 

It's probably fair to say that part of my issue with this is my negative/ambivalent feeling toward anxiety vs. adhd. I'm sure I don't know the full extent of anxiety treatment, but, at least pharmacologically I'm completely disinterested- From what I've heard, I wouldn't touch benzos with a 10 foot pole. Whereas, while, I've mostly avoided stimulants in the past when they've come up in therapy say, I would at least be open to them as a treatment option. 

Regarding my (potential) ADHD symptoms: Sure, I never needed ""special attention"" in school exactly; I didn't flunk out or anything, but I described that I didn't do *awesome* and a lot of that had to do with being unable to complete practically any homework, for instance. Without some outside structure I feel, honestly, completely lost. That's where I was before I got a job in November, which was a big reason why I went down the road to see if I have this thing and if I can be helped. 

It's almost impossible for me to do certain self-motivated projects, I jump from interest to interest within a matter of weeks, I do that think where I say ""what?"" to my wife before she's done telling me something (and before I process that I actually understood), etc etc. 

The only thing off the top of my head that I don't exactly have in common with many ADHD folks is that I don't do a lot of blurting out, or giving people a lot of personal info right away. But, as I described during this interview, I feel like I use to when I was a kid and I've gone completely in the opposite direction because of the negative feedback I received then- I have all these different things to say that pop into my head but I say none of them unless I'm 100% sure I won't offend or give away any information that I think could bite me. 

I dunno, I guess I'm just bummed, and I don't quite believe it. If I don't have ADHD, that's fine. Obviously it's not like I 'want' to have a mental disorder, even if mild. I've got a job that works for me right now and I can baaaaasically manage. But I certainly would like a second opinion. 

Has anybody had to do that after one of these? Can they give another provider all of their notes, copies of tests, etc or do they just give this evaluation summary? 

**TL;DR: Got evaluated for ADHD, supposedly don't have ADHD (but I do have an anxiety disorder?), but I'm a little skeptical and not sure where to go from here**"

I've been admitted to the following majors:

* Berkeley L&amp;S - Intended CS on application  

   * I was admitted in February as a Regents Scholarship Candidate (didn't get it though eventually F)
* UCLA CS in Samueli Engineering College  

   * also admitted as a regents scholarship candidate

Context

* from Bay Area (Cal \~\` hr away)
* come from competitive Bay Area school
* 4 years of CS experience (hackathons, projects, internships), no math competition experience

Cal Pros

* close to home
* visited campus and really liked it
* Tied for best CS department there is
* in Silicon Valley
* semester system
* from what I've found, more well known overall and lots of prestige internationally

Cal Cons

* have to meet the 3.3 gpa requirement for L&amp;S CS
   * my main worry is doing cs70 as I haven't done math comps b4
* stressful environment

UCLA Pros

* guaranteed CS
* more relaxed environment
* really nice campus from what I've seen online

UCLA Cons

* not as well known for cs/not as strong cs program
* quarter system
* farther from home

What would you all suggest? I'm heavily leaning towards Cal, just kinda worried if I won't get to declare CS since I'm 100% set on doing it."

I have no one in my life besides my fiance really to tell this without causing social problems so I'm going to tell you all. After 1200 applications, 40 interviews, 3 take-home projects, creating my own personal website, overhauling my LinkedIn and Github. I've finally gotten an offer!

&amp;#x200B;

Position: Java Back-End Software Engineer intern

Pay: $30 p/h

Full time for 12 weeks

I'm wondering if I shot myself in the foot though. The HR rep called me and said he was happy to offer me the position and when I said yes he immediately followed up by asking me if $30 p/h is okay, I was so hyped at getting an offer in the first place I just said yes. They haven't sent an offer letter yet, but do you guys think I left a lot of money on the table? This will be my first software internship. I interviewed with Visa and BNY Mellon as well and am waiting to hear back from them. I'm honestly really happy with this, but because this is my first experience with this kind of thing I'm not sure if I messed up or not.

Thank you all! Good vibes and wishes your way!

edit: some spelling stuff, clarifications

Edit 2: just wanted to say thank you to everyone you are all amazing people and love you all. I thought a 3% response rate was really bad at first but I guess I’m feeling much better about it now. Keep it up every one who’s still looking!"

My husband and I moved to Vancouver around mid-2020. For the first year, our tax returns were taken care of by the company that hired him (outsourced), but for 2021, we're on our own. 

In 2021, I returned to Austria for 6 months (exactly!) to do a paid internship and do my final university exam. I got back in Canada end of September and started working here in November. 

I'm not sure whether my tax residency has changed since I was gone for exactly 6 months. (had a lengthy discussion with BC Services to ensure that I kept my coverage)

There's a part that asks: 

&gt;Enter your province or territory of residence on December 31, 2021 - BC  
&gt;  
&gt;If you became or ceased to be a resident of Canada for income tax purposes in 2021, enter the date of entry or departure 

Have I become or ceased to be a resident of Canada for 2021? Or does my residency start the first time we entered (mid-2020)?

Also, I'm having a hard time determining what to declare for my Canadian income tax/filing for tax returns? 

Do I need to include earnings from my internship? Austria and Canada have an agreement to avoid double taxation, but I haven't officially filed my taxes in Austria yet, so I'm not sure how to proceed. 

Would anyone have a tip/suggestion for this? We're not sure if this is a ""complex"" enough case to hire someone to prepare the income tax returns for us. (if we should hire someone, any suggestions where/who?)

Any help is greatly appreciated!"

History Teacher: 9.8/10, also loves me and has been teaching me since sophomore year (I keep signing up for his classes), came in to my work to offer to write me a letter, -0.2 points for submitting it ten days late (his power went out while skiing. Classic.)

College Math Teacher: 7/10, had a strong personal relationship but I was kind of a goof in her class sometimes, talked with her a lot about my passions and interests

Interviews (as a side note, I did not prepare for any interview. I have always prided myself on my ability to talk to people fluently, prepping ruins that ability)

Harvard: 9/10, she ended up loving the store I worked at, cool connection. She also had just finished reading the book I was then reading, talked about the importance of reading in education. She said she would do what she could to get me into Harvard (lol)

Personal Statement: 7/10. Had lots of difficulty writing this piece, ended up focusing on a severe fall off a cliff that could have taken my life, learned how to take responsibility for myself and my actions and became a more mature individual. I regret not relating it to my major in all honesty.

UCs: 9/10. Felt able to express myself and my creativity. Best one was on how I express my creativity through mathematics due to my shortcomings artistically.

Yale Supplementals: 6.8/10. Strong, but I feel as if they didn’t show my love for Yale enough. Talked about volunteering and my
Investing EC mainly

Brown Supplementals: 8/10. Spent months trying to perfect, also missing a strong passion for Brown particularly. Talked about combining Econ and high level math through ope curriculum 

Princeton Supplementals: 9.5/10, current student read and approved each one. Poured a lot into these. That’s all I will say.

MIT Supplementals: 8/10: all strong except had difficulty with the community one. Couldn’t place my finger on a direction I truly wanted to go.

u7lpxi,88,2022-04-19,I bullied HR to follow the law,bavarianGaijin,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/u7lpxi/i_bullied_hr_to_follow_the_law/,"Went back and forth on whether to post this for some time, but here it is: (First post, not american or native english speaking.. yada yada)


So I (20M at the time) worked for a big billion dollar company with about 8000 employees nationwide, represented in the entire EU. I worked for them as a student for 20hr/week for over two years beside my studies and everything was great. Small team of mostly younger people who were exceptionally nice, great boss who really cared about his employees, and very valuable experience in my field, plus above average pay.
With no set working hours and the ability to clock in and out (digitally with our badge, important later) whenever you want. As long as you don't miss any important meetings we had free reign.


That was until the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit. Specifically in the beginning of March when the whole country went into lockdown and our location was closed for everyone until further notice.


Nowadays, many Students who work for a company may get a laptop and have the opportunity to work from home.


Not here. Barely any full time employees had the ability before the pandemic, let alone students. And when the demand for laptops and work from home skyrocketed, our (very old timey) IT department was at a loss.
With nowhere near the ability to satisfy the demand. First our engineers and management got laptops or remote workstations.

With over 3000 in our headquarters alone you can imagine what was left for the students. Nada.


Alrighty no problem, no ability to work and all projects on hold, it seems like an easy few weeks off until we get the ability to work remotely, or are able to get back into the office, or so I thought.
Problem is the law and HR rules differs greatly between full time employees and students/interns. While they have the protection and benefits of getting full pay in this situation, short term employees such as us, do not. 


Which meant that we accumulated negative hours every week that we didn't work. You see, our clocking in system was simple, your weekly hours were added up. If you worked more, it was added to your total and you could take an extra few days off. If you worked less you had the ability to make it up until the end of the year, or carry them over to the next until your contract ends. 
But crucially, when you were in the negative by the end of your employment, you had to pay back what you were payed from your fixed salary.


As we now know the pandemic lasted more than a few weeks and when I was allowed back at the office, 3 months have gone by. Which meant a whole Fuckton of negative hours.
(20hr x 4Weeks x 3 Months x 14€ = 3360€)


I tried to work as much as possible to get them back to zero, but no luck. There was no work to be done for a student at the time, and I was lucky to get enough work for 20hrs/week.


Sidenote: That was only possible because my boss thankfully asked around and had me moved to a different department, which luckily had work. That department... Archives. Down in a dark cellar, copying, sorting and stowing endless amounts of meaningless paper, that had accumulated for years.
That is where I met a few fellow students that were sent there just as I was.


And on the horizon was the renewal of my contract, which was due every 6 months. Up until now there was never a problem. If your boss liked you and you wanted to stay, there wasn't even a discussion. But now the company kicked out every Intern, Student, short term, or external employee. And my deadline was 2 months away, with over 800 hours minus on my record (many of which were quite old that I originally hoped to get back during summer vacation)


I was at a loss. I didn't have the money to pay back those hours at the end of my contract. And so naturally I complained to my family about it who shared my frustration and told me to hit up my uncle, who was a layer.


I explained everything to him and he got to Fucking work! He dug out anything he could and sent me a legal text to copy and paste to HR which went a little something like:


In times of unexpected inability to work... bla bla bla... no option provided ... the cost must fall on the employer, not the employee ... and such applies here ... herby we request all hour that (me) was not able to work to be negated...


This I emailed to HR and a fight ensued. I was Cc'ed to members of the legal department and many higher-ups. But ultimately I was given back the hours that I missed during the lockdown. 


Needless to say I was ecstatic and expected the same to happen to all my fellow students/interns. I asked HR and they promised me they were right on it. Nice.


I reported my success to my colleagues in the archive bunker and they were just as happy as I was. All of them had accumulated incredible amounts of negative hours during the pandemic and all seemed well. A small success for the students.


But after weeks of asking whether or not they have gotten an email from HR or if their negative hours had changed, I got frustrated and again asked HR if they were planning on implicating a general rule, which they assured me they were.


But after many more weeks I got too frustrated and broke. You see. There was an Email-list for students and interns that was originally (pre-pandemic) used by everyone to meet up and drink in a fun little group. There were about 800+ people in the nationwide email-list, and from time to time you would get an invitation to meet in a bar. Every student/intern was encouraged by the HR initiation letter to sign up to this email-list, and many did.


So I wrote the most widespread Email I have written in my entire life, to everyone on the list:


Hey, fellow student from x-location here.
All my corona hours were wiped, and here is what I wrote to HR to do it...


With a detailed guide on what to say, and if they did this for me, they sure as shit should do it for you. And an encouragement to tell everyone that may not be on the list.


I was Cc'ed in hundreds of emails to HR within hours. And many more thanked me in emails, that they had the same problems that I did and didn't know how to pay back those hours when their contract ended.


Many more Emails with technical questions, with their bosses and HR in Cc, to which I happily replied with my best knowledge of how I was treated by HR, and that they would have to get the same treatment. 


The next day I got into the office I started my morning with a glorious company wide Email that I remember as follows:


We the gracious HR have considered and generously decided that all students/interns may have their Corona-hours revoked.
Thank me, you peasantry students, please don't email us anymore.....


plz...


I left the company months later with amazing memories and a wholesome goodbye from all my coworkers.


But at the end of the day I learned this:

Fuck the HR, they work for the company not for you...


tldr; Got treated different by HR, sent an email to all Students/interns and encouraged them to do the same. Company folded because of flood of emails.


Edit- The sad thing is, many students were convinced by their bosses to put their contract on hold during the  pandemic.

In primul rand sa ma prezint🙂

Lucrez ca tehnician IT, inca din 2008. In tot acest timp pana acum, am facut mai mult munca de teren decat de birou. Am avut oportunitatea sa lucrez pe implementare si dezvoltare magazine online, pe o perioada cumulata de 4 ani, iar partea de front-end chiar nu ma avantajeaza, neavand atractie de stilizare si design.

Aptitudinile mele sunt tehnice si logice cu inclinatie spre ""problem solveing"".
In toti acesti ani am acumulat cunostinte pe o arie vasta, incepand de la configurari software si hardware pe sisteme de calcul si periferice, retelistica, sisteme de supraveghere, acces control si automatizari, securitate &amp; cloud, administrare server (mai putin pe linux) in special windows server 2016 si 2019 cu active directory, baze de date SQL microsoft server, incepator pe front-end cu HTML, JavaScript si CCS (da incepator, aici chiar nu am vrut sa ma dezvolt mai mult).

In prezent am luat decizia sa invat programare in Python.
Imi place ideea de a imbina pe viitor AI, ML si DL, in special pe segmentul automotive unde in prezent se utilizeaza C/C++ precum MISRA-C/C++. Am inceput sa ma documentez, sa vad pe ce nisa sa ma axez si cel mai potrivit pentru mine, ar fi pe automatizare avand ca pasiune si partea de automotive. Din pasiune, mai lucrez la masinile mele cot la cot cu mecanicul si ma ocup de partea electrica, diagnoza si soft.

De o luna de zile am inceput cursurile de la Microsoft Virtual Training Days pe Security, MO 365 si Azure Cloud, pentru a-mi actualiza certificarile si am primit o oferta de internship remote ca DevOps Junior, la o companie multinationala pe BPO&amp;Services non FAANG.

Din cate m-am documentat am observat ca e cerere mare pe DevOps, ca nu prea se implica nimeni. Probabil in viitorul apropiat o sa dispara pozitia DevOps avand in vedere cloud-ul, docker+ kubernetes si toolurile tot mai simple de CI/CD pipelines.

Intrebarea este daca are viitor o pozitie ca DevOps, unde desigur mai lucrezi in Bash/Python, sau sa merg din start pe programare in Python?

As dori cateva argumente pro/contra, daca e posibil.
Multumesc!"

What I see a lot is people talk about barely getting an internship with a bachelors degree and a few years of coding experience and then I see people get a job right after they get their degrees.


I do plan on improving and honing my skills with Java and to do better and be consistent everyday but I don’t feel like an internship with an associate degree will be an easy thing to accomplish.
I know degree’s do not matter once your are working but company tend to have some crazy standards for resumes and experience over 3 years with multiple languages.

Does an associates degree not have much value to companies or is it just something that not many people consider and just either skip the degree and self teach or get their bachelors instead."

I am curious as to the job opportunities available if I pursue a dual degree in Finance and International Relations.

I am interested in working with international organizations, NGOs, or international banks in the future.

I am also very interested in moving overseas most likely to Canada, Australia, an EU country, or a Western European country sometime after graduating because I am concerned about the direction the US is going in.

I am definitely planning on applying to a master's degree program after graduating and it will most likely be in western Europe. However, I am unsure if it will be in finance or something international relation related (MSc in Global Studies, or something).

So do you think my dual degree will be practical? Or is there something more useful I can double major in with finance or international relations?

Will I have decent job prospects assuming I have decent grades and internship experience?

Will getting a job overseas be difficult?

Which major would it be better for me to get my masters in? Finance or something related to International Relations?

Any advice is appreciated! Thank You!"

20 yo, first-generation American, low income, first semester at community college, dabbled in Python,HTML and CSS, genuinely been interested in tech. since I was a kid, currently attending community college, attended a competitive high school in India, alright with math

**My plan before I learned about boot camps:**

I was born in California so I am a US citizen. At age 1, my parents moved to India where I lived until 18. At 18, I moved to Virginia on my own. The reason I did this was because I planned to work for a year and stay financially independent so that I could get in-state tuition and attend community college for free eventually transferring to UVA or VT to complete my degree. Moving to a country where I had never been and had no support was difficult. It took a lot of hustle. I don't say this to brag, I only say it to show that I can hustle if it is required.

I qualified for in-state tuition and have been attending community college for free for a few weeks now. I planned to take APs in math and comp sci and complete some general eds at community college before transferring in Fall 2023.

**My goal:**

My goal is to retire by 30. I understand it sounds insane but I believe I can do it.

I figure that the best way to do this is to get involved in tech startups either by working for one or by starting my own.

It will take me 4 years to graduate from college with a CS degree. A CS degree will include 3 years of learning (3 fall semesters + 3 spring semesters) + 1 year of work experience (assuming an internship every summer)

It will take me 1 year to complete a boot camp + be hired at my first job at a startup company (3-6 months Bootcamp + 3-6 months job search)

I think it is fair to say that Work Experience &gt; Learning through Bootcamp or college

If we can agree on that, the difference in 4 years will be:

With the Bootcamp route, I get 1-year learning + 3 years of work experience

With the College route, I get 3-years learning + 1-year work experience

I understand that non-degree applicants get screened out by HR immediately. I hypothesize that at a startup company, I can skip HR because I can reach out to top-level management at the company directly.

I understand that this is a high-risk strategy but the opportunity cost of being at college for 4 years just feels unreasonably high.

If I do fail with this strategy, I can always go back to school to get a CS degree.

If you disagree with anything I've said, please let me know. If you have any thoughts at all, please feel free to share. I appreciate any honest feedback because I could be missing something very obvious.

So I got a job offer for around a ~22% increase in pay + a full time job offer (While im still in school). However the current company promises to take me on full time after graduation, and for now just want to extend me on the internship with slightly higher pay for market competition.

Im thinking that this can be an easy in from my internship into getting into a semi developer role, from which I can jump into a full develop role down the road. 

If anyone has experience in this field, let me know."

I am also not enrolled in any college so I do not have any placement support as well. I tried to find a job for the position of Junior Web Developer/ Web developer because I need money in order to complete my higher studies. No one in my family belongs from tech background and all of my friends are still in college, so I do not have any network with anyone from tech background. I also do not have any placement support. I tried to find a job independently by applying on various online platforms such as LinkedIn, Zip Recruiter, Chegg internships, directly from career page of different companies, by sending direct mails to different companies but mostly I do not get any response or an excuse that they have already chosen a candidate or they are not hiring in my location. In simple terms, I do not even get any chance for an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if I am an independent learner with no placement support, family support or friends support, how can I find a lead for a job in tech company. Right now I prefer the position of web developer."
u7ziui,3,2022-04-20,"Bad work environment, or is it just my anxiety?",redlxtj,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/u7ziui/bad_work_environment_or_is_it_just_my_anxiety/,"Hey guys,

I've been working my first full-time role (only did internships in the past) for the past two months and would like to get advice on my circumstances at work. I'm basically here to find out if the problem lies moreso with me or a new manager that's recently come on board. Also wanting to get a general idea on how capable a two-month old employee should be.

**To set the stage about myself:** I graduated in November 2021 and started this job at the end of February. I'm quite the introvert but I can be friendly in social situations, but when it comes to work I prefer to keep my head down and finish my tasks. I would consider myself to let others take charge in discussions - hence that's why I find myself not asking enough questions about things I might not completely understand. I feel that this has to do with the fact that I'm prone to anxiety, which also **affects my work performance, my communication skills, and makes me forgetful at times, and somewhat bad at attention to detail**.

A new Account Director joined the company about three weeks into my job. She's quite an interesting character: one moment she could be giddy and happy, and the next she could be extremely anxious and neurotic. However, I'd describe her as having low EQ: she snapped at another director on her second week, she's openly critical (but not constructively) about how our current work processes and ways of doing things don't work or aren't optimal, bad personal stress management, etc. But overall, despite her occasional tantrums I'd still describe her as **somewhat** friendly (a 5/10 rating).

**The situation**:

Being two months into the role, I've had exposure to some but not to all of the things the company does - but I still haven't had complete exposure to an end-to-end project and so inevitably there are knowledge gaps (as I don't know what I don't know until I have hands on experience with a project).

I'll try explain this the best I can without bogging you down with details: She asked me a question about a task. I then asked another question to another coworker not knowing that it was essentially the same question with the same answer which I already knew (as it was my first time being involved in that particular stage of a project).

She then started condescendingly grilling me asking about what I wasn't understanding and why I kept asking the same question (mind you it was only ONCE I asked my other colleague), and then again giving an explanation condescendingly. Felt like my intelligence was insulted, and my anxiety got the best of me to explain myself, but I tried to suck it up to be better for next time. Had a talk with her the next day explaining that I did not have experience with all the stages of a project, and all would be fine I hoped.

Yesterday, another similar situation happened, but this time it was about me not understanding and wrongly doing a process of a specific task, and I was grilled again (AGAIN because I did not have experience with this stage of the project, and I didn't know what I didn't know). With some coworkers present, she threw a tantrum berating how our current ways of doing things were a complete waste of time and opted to take on the job herself (leaving me with nothing for the day).

At this point my anxiety was flaring up. It didn't help that when I tried reassuring her I'll get it done by the end of the day she condescendingly asked ""Oh but do you know what to do with X? with Y? have you worked using Z?"" With my anxiety still flaring, I had a hard time concentrating and focusing on things she was explaining later that day and at time I didn't realise I was zoning out, to which she would say things like ""Is this task too much to ask from you?"", ""Are you going to ask me ABC yet again?""

Again, not here to disparage the new Account Director, in fact I can see that she's very good at her job and I can learn a lot from her but I just don't feel like all that expertise is being transferred onto me effectively. I know I have a social anxiety problem, which I feel has been affecting how I act in the workplace in social and professional situations even before the new Account Director was hired. I feel that

**My question is this:** Do you think that my workplace issues have more to do with my anxiety issues (affecting work performance, communication skills, comprehension), or that the new Account Director is just difficult to work with? I can't help but feel that I actually might be the problem, and if I weren't so affected by anxiety I would be a more capable employee and hence not being grilled all the time. Also wanting to get a general idea on how capable a two-month old employee should be.

I'd be happy to give more details for anyone willing to give their two cents to explain the situation even better.

**TL;DR:** I'm prone to anxiety which I'm sure affects my work performance and communication skills. Neurotic Account Director makes it worse. I want to find out if the problem moreso lies with my social anxiety or the Account Director.  


EDIT: added forgetfulness and attention to detail to how anxiety affects me"
u7zozk,5,2022-04-20,How viable is finding summer internships for software engineering while pursuing a BSc in Physics?,not1enough,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/u7zozk/how_viable_is_finding_summer_internships_for/,"Hello!

I'm about to finish high school and have been left with two primary study routes - either pursue a longer and more expensive degree in CS, or an affordable one in Physics. I'm quite confident I could do well in both, however ultimately I'm looking to work in software engineering.

As far as I understand, internships are incredibly important when finding a job after graduating. So I wanted to ask, is there anyone who is pursuing a degree in a different STEM field who successfully found internships for software development? A portfolio and personal projects are obviously a must, but how big of an obstacle would I be facing if I were studying Physics instead of CS? I'd be applying all over Europe and speak pretty good German.

I'm quite inclined to pick the option with lower financial strain, but also want to avoid shooting myself in the foot. I'd appreciate if anyone could give some insight!"

He graduated high school a year early and already had 1.5 years' worth of college credit when he graduated. In order to graduate in 1 year at 18, he will need to take a summer semester (which he doesn't mind doing) and a full load during the Fall and Spring semester, but he is the one pushing to do this, and neither he (nor I) are concerned about him being able to handle the load academically.

I am wondering if there are any downsides, career-wise, for him to be a very young college graduate - basically, the same age as most kids are starting college.

His other option would have him spacing the classes out more and graduating a year later, at 19 years old.

His scholarships will pay for most or all of his tuition either way, so money isn't an issue.

Another consideration is his availability to participate in extracurriculars. He has just been elected President of the student chapter of UPE and VP of ACM for the coming year and I assume he would stay involved in both organizations if he stayed at school for another year. And of course another year of college allows room for more internship experience as well. Neither of these ""opportunities"" is motivating enough in his mind to delay graduation for another year. I'm not opposed to it either—not that it's my choice to make—but I want to help him consider all angles of the issue.

Grad school is a possibility but he is undecided about that right now.

Thoughts, opinions, and experiences appreciated!

TL;DR: Are there downsides to entering the job market with a BS in CS at 18 years of age?

Thanks,

Lisa

EDITING TO ADD MORE INFO: 

He is currently 17 years old and will turn 18 this summer. This is his first year as an official college student but he actually started taking classes there as a dual enrollment high school student part-time at 15-years-old and full-time at 16. I will say that he didn't really get involved in campus activities until this school year because he wasn't driving until last summer. 

He is currently doing an internship that is about half IT/half programming. Not the perfect internship but he was turned down for several others due to not being 18 yet. 

He is double-majoring in math and computer science. 

And for those that seemed to miss it in the first paragraph, nobody is pushing him to graduate any earlier than he has to. It's his idea. I'd rather he slow down and enjoy it, but it's not my decision to make.

I know the vibe of startups are much different and there is so much room to explore in terms of marketing in social media.

So basically, I just wanted to ask people working in start-ups how you navigate your social medias? Right now, I'm handling facebook, instagram, twitter, and now I was asked to explore reddit.

I had to go from an internship to being a junior dev with the company to get here and that took about 6 months. It was good at first the pay is above average and since covid I have been able to work completely remote. After some time training I was thrown into being the lead developer for an up coming release of a new project which seems to me is a lot of responsibility to give someone you just hired and is completely new to working in a professional setting like this. I was put on the project because the lead dev left the company shortly after I arrived and I inherited his mess. I was paired with a senior dev to do some extremely hands off training (I have been here about 6 months now and I still have to ask him questions constantly). I always feel like I am overwhelmed and under trained and that they ask too much of me. The team I got put on defiantly seems to be understaffed and overworked when I do ask for help I usually have to wait for someone to get back to me. The whole experience has really made question whether I am right for this role and field, I feel like I am always stressed and anxious about getting this project finished since I have to keep moving the dev complete date back. I also feel like I am not ready to be working 40 hours a week as a 22 year old. Any thoughts on how I should handle the situation?"

u85kl9,7,2022-04-20,Internship with stinky tech stack vs MLH Fellowship??,mangoparty559,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u85kl9/internship_with_stinky_tech_stack_vs_mlh/,"Which one should I do?

The internship is with a company which provides online banking services. Lots of legacy code in PowerOn and PL/1, as well as some more modern stuff in Angular and .NET. It's a small team and I would be the only intern, basically doing pair programming every day across different parts of the codebase,  a little bit of everything.

The MLH Fellowship is for the production engineering track (although I have the option to switch to the software engineering track), teaching devops stuff like AWS, Docker, CD/CI. Modern tech, but it's not an internship, is totally remote, and pays a lot less.

I'm only a freshman so really just looking to do whatever will boost my resume the most. What do you guys think I should do?"

I’ll try to keep this short. I’m a freshman in college, and I’m torn between mech and electrical. 

On one hand, I’m fascinated by computers. I very much enjoy breadboarding and circuit design, as well as electrical systems design. I know this barely scratches the surface of electrical engineering, and I’m uncertain what a career in that would look like.

On the other hand, I’m more familiar with mechanical engineering. I’ve taken several classes through high school, and held a mechanical internship, and very much so enjoy CAD modeling and physical design work. I feel I have a much more definite feel for what mechanical engineering will look like as a profession.

In short, I’m having a hard time discerning which of these are a hobby, and which are something I’d consider pursuing as a degree. I’d appreciate an advice as to what people in the different fields have to say (e.g what projects they have worked on in the past, what their job entails, so on)."

I was super eager to start my career and excited to just get a chance in the industry when I got hired. After being on the team for a couple months I was thrown into finishing the project someone else who had left the company was working on. This would have been fine if I had some sort of help. I can ask the senior dev who trained me some questions but I am usually just left to figure things out myself. 

I have been working on this project for a few months now and I feel completely overwhelmed and stressed out. I keep having to push the deadline back because I get stuck on issues I don’t think I should be having. The internship was supposed to train me for the tools that we are using but my team uses some different tools than I was taught. I constantly am stressed out and anxious I have been dealing with worsening depression since I have almost no free time and I am always banging my head against a wall trying to figure things out at work. This whole experience has made me question wether this role and field is right for me. The money is nice but it feels like my whole life is consumed by this work. I work from home and do not get out much so it feels like I am living in a box with no way out. 

Maybe I am not mature enough to handle this responsibility since I am only 22 and not even graduated college yet. I could use any advice I am not sure what to do."

I occasionally hung with her on weekends and stayed at her house, but since I got a job a year ago i have spent my weekends working. In the next coming semester i have plans for college tours, internships, and relationships. 

My mom called me and told me that she plans on moving and that this is non-negotiable. She sees it as I belong in a house for her, that’s what’s best for me and I “don’t know what’s best for me”. She’s said it’s like i’m avoiding her by working on weekends and that i don’t wanna move and live with her because i don’t love her.   
I’m trying to make her understand that although I love her with all my heart that I don’t wanna throw away everything I worked for just for 1 year of living with her and then have to go through everything again. Maybe i’m just overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. 

I’ve always tried to make her proud by doing the best I could in everything like sports, school, work etc. Am i looking at this the wrong way? I’m very lost and need advice."

After a successful recruiting season, i was able to get offers as a MLE intern for Apple (summer) and SWE intern for Snap (fall). I am interested in returning to full time if given the opportunity and ive been told its likely at both internships as long as i do well. Next year during my senior year, i imagine i will be deciding between both these companies.

However, the problem is i will most likely be getting the apple return offer (if i do) before ill have a chance to get a snap return offer because its in the fall.

As a new grad, which would ideally be the better options? I care about WLB/Pay a lot

I heard for AI/ML interns, theyre usually offered an ICT3 position as new grads. Can someone confirm this? If so, im leaning towards Apple but ive also heard about Snaps massive TC jump when promoted to L4. I want to hear everyones opinions!

Apple team: Machine Learning Platform &amp; Technology (MLPT) Team

Snap team: Lens Studio, Camera Platform

u88naf,3,2022-04-20,Things to do during sophomore summer w/o internship,benzeneorange,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u88naf/things_to_do_during_sophomore_summer_wo_internship/,"So I’m a new CS major, originally studying something in the physical sciences but realized I didn’t want to go to grad/med school to become employable and just switched to CS last semester during my sophomore year. I’m currently in our school’s intermediate class/DSA class equivalent, learning abt C++, unix, and all sorts of data structures and whatnot. 

Admittedly I did not realize the importance of job experience until halfway through this school year because in the physical sciences field, you just tried to keep your GPA up to apply for grad school. But ever since March, I’ve tried applying to a bunch of internships, probably 50+ at this point, and will keep applying to more, but I feel like the chances of me landing a summer internship rn are looking slim, also because I have no previous CS experience lol. 

My current plan is to just take summer CS classes in my college, since our CS department is actually quite overcrowded and those same classes are already full in the fall, so I think it’d be beneficial to take them right now. But I know these classes will probably eat up all of my time during summer and Idk if it’s the best thing to sign up for in case I do get an internship or if I want to start my own projects during summer. The other thing I could do is continue doing research in my college during the summer. I’m currently in a research lab (unrelated to CS) and doing some computational work with my professor. However the pay isn’t much lol and I’m not sure if that’s better or worse than knocking out CS prereqs/start my own project. 

Any advice is helpful, TIA!"
u88ojp,1,2022-04-20,Considering a career change before even graduating...,whyyoustabbedme,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u88ojp/considering_a_career_change_before_even_graduating/,"Long post warning

// Okay, short summary: I've prepared for a career in the business side of renewable energy but now I'm concerned it might not be the right kind of job for me. I'm considering a CS or DS post bacc to a...sort of back-door MSCS via PhD to work in programming, analytics or AI in the same field and I'm wondering if that's a feasible path or if it's even the right thing to do.

Next semester I'm graduating from a...I guess top 40 US university, majoring in economics and political science, with a big quant/statistical bent in both fields.

My plan for the past 2 years has been to go into renewable energy consulting/production/sales/trading. That's extremely broad but my general thought was that my expertise would reveal itself as I worked in the field for a few years.

Now I'm looking for Winter internships to lead into recruiting season, but...I'm having second thoughts. Not about the field, but about my function in it.

For starters, I am a characteristically laid back person. I wasn't really built with executive capacities and the idea of working &gt;60hr weeks is absolutely maddening to me. This is mandatory in the functions I previously mentioned, but I know that most programmers and data scientists work regular hours.

Secondly, I think I may have an aptitude for coding. For a few of my classes I've started using R and Stata, and it's honestly all come very easily to me. I've spent a lot of independent time learning more about the languages beyond their uses in class, and I find the process of problem-solving and building my functional knowledge of the languages is very mentally rewarding.

Engineering is, obviously, something that is highly important for energy production (and at the same time I'm wondering if EE/CE could be a good path, yikes), but data analytics and AI technologies are becoming increasingly important in the field, particularly in newer (read: renewable) technologies. I'm really interested in getting involved in this advancement during its nascent phases.

My question is how I pursue this. I don't want to do boot camp because I'm worried it may be too risky, and also, having no CS background, I want to become both employable and proficient, not just the former.

Tufts has an attractive looking post bacc program, and so does Georgetown, Washington, and NCSU. It looks like a lot of other schools (Columbia, Colorado, Penn, Miami, Maryland, Harvard, NYU...) also have CS and DS post bacc options, but maybe not dedicated programs, and their websites are a little more vague. Any testimonies for any of these?

I'm thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea, if I end up pursing this lead, to complete one of these programs as a lead into a potential CS PhD program--I have no interest in a CS PhD, but as many of you probably know, it's quite easy in the majority of cases to enter a PhD program, do enough work for, in this case an MSCS, and drop out with that degree, no money paid.

Sure, you may burn your academic bridges with some individuals, but I'm doing this for professional reasons, and there's no reason it should impact your relationship with most of your former MSCS instructors, so who really cares?

What do you think? Does this sound like a reasonable action plan?"

I've seen on here that some companies continue to keep applications open even after there are no open spots so I'm wondering if Amazon would still be accepting candidates this late into the application cycle.

In addition, are there any good resources I can use to see which companies are still hiring interns for Summer 2022; I came across a site before which had this info but I can't find it anymore. :("
u896a6,13,2022-04-20,"I Used to Love Bugs Until I Found "" The Mother of Vermin""",Realistic_Treacle384,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u896a6/i_used_to_love_bugs_until_i_found_the_mother_of/,"Most people have religion, art, or some stupid tv show to give their lives meaning. I had bugs. Ever since I was little, I was obsessed with the critters. I’d go out into my Momma’s garden every day just to see which of the little beats I could dig out of the mud. Parents hated it, especially after I got the house infested with ants, but I didn’t let that stop me. I continued with my little obsessions for years and years, but it always remained just that: little. A fun pass time to waste a few hours before getting on with my life.

It wasn’t until college that that changed. Did you know there’s a whole profession of people who get paid to sit around and study insects all day? Probably, but I didn’t. It was like a sign from God. Every day since my discovery, I worked to be one of those people. I even actually studied. Like actually sat down and looked at a textbook. Can you imagine? Stretch that out for four fucking years and you’d be looking out the best Biology student on campus. Believe me, I was surprised too, but didn’t complain.

 I got to see some pretty cool shit as I worked my way up the rungs. First honor student, then T.A., research assistant, until finally, I scored an internship at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Now I know what you’re thinking, and yeah, yeah, big opportunity, real impressive, “wow, you must be so happy,” but that’s not where my mind went. The only thing I carried about walking through those doors on my first day was bugs. And boy did they deliver.

There had to be millions of the damn things, all sitting around collecting dust in these big old cabinets. I don’t understand how any of those eggheads could keep away from them all. There were critters as big as my fuckin head, some with rows of mandibles looking engorged with venom, and a handful that I swear were still alive and looking right at me with these big, alien eyes. Not that they were being nailed in place like they were, but I still got a kick outta them.

And I wasn’t no slacker, either. I worked my ass off at that place. I sorted out files, cleaned up the exhibits, got people coffee, all that boring shit, and you know what, I did it well. So well that eventually, I started getting noticed by people. One of those people is the whole reason I’m writing this in the first place: Dr. Abigail Harrington. Yeah, I thought she sounded like a douche too. Abigail was the head of the entomology department at the university, which she took this weird sorta pride in. I loved bugs too, but this guy acted like that made her king of the world. Her office was covered in those glass cases you see people keep dead bugs inside on display, and she made sure to work that in every conversation. And I mean, every conversation. Most everyone else tried to avoid her when they could. Everyone except for me.

I’d never really know anyone who got me, you know? I knew people who liked bugs, but no one ever shared my obsession with them. Usually, I’d end up chasing them away with some rant about centipedes or the various kinds of indigenous ants, but not the Doc. If anything, I was struggling to keep up with her. Guy knew more about insects and the like than I thought possible. Every time we so much as bumped into each other in the hallways, we ended up talking for six hours straight over some obscure detail about the common house cockroach or something. Half the time, I didn’t even know what we were talking about, just that I was having a ball discussing it. We were each other’s drug, just feeding into our excitement until we slipped into this weird, feverish daze that made hours slip by in seconds. Probably wasn’t healthy, considering most of the time our discussions ate up, but I’ll be damned if it wasn’t fun.

Doc seemed to be enjoying it too, but I think we were happy that anyone was indulging her. The more we talked, the more she wanted to talk, so she started pulling some strings to make sure we worked closer and closer. Pretty soon, I ended up her private assistant working with  her all hours of the day. Although, ‘work’ might have been an exaggeration. We did what we needed to earn our paychecks, and then the rest of the day would be spent tumbling down a rabbit hole of obscure bug facts. 

Sometimes, however, the Doc would stop rambling about insects with me and instead start telling me about her own experiences with bugs. Specifically, all the expeditions she went on to study them. Gal had traveled all over the world, searching out some of the rarest species on the planet, sometimes not even for research purposes. She’d pay thousands of dollars out of pocket and trek miles through harsh jungles, all to catch a peek at whichever critter happened to be her latest passion. Anyone else would’ve thought she was crazy. I, on the other hand, also thought she was crazy but only liked the guy more for it. 

After a few months of this, we fell into something of a pattern. I’d come in, we’d get our work done, geek out over bugs, and if I was lucky, I’d get to hear her fawn over one of her past excursions with the excitement of a little kid on Christmas. It wasn’t until one day, a few months into our little routine, that things started getting a little weird. We were doing our typical shtick, talking about, I don’t know, cockroaches or whatever, when all of the sudden, the Doc starts talking about this new insect that I’d never heard of before. 

“The Mother of Vermin,” she called it with this wild look in her eye. “The rarest species of arthropod in the whole world. It’s only been seen ten times in all of recorded history, and not one specimen has ever been recovered. Local legend says it’s the size of a full-grown man and dwells the deepest, darkest parts of the Amazon, under a tree that never blooms.”

“Riiiiiight,” I said, waiting for the punchline.

“I was skeptical myself at first. Just a regional bedtime story meant to scare the children. That is, until I went down there myself. Until I heard something in the forest. In the dead of night, when all the critters are alive and singing their various songs, something cut through their merrymaking. A call like nothing I’d ever heard before. I didn’t hear it, not exactly. You see, it didn’t chirp like the other insects. Rather, all of the calls harmonized until a single sound thundered through the jungle. A song of something impossibly ancient. It called out across the woods, and all the vermin were made to obey, carrying the rhythm of their Mother.”

Now, for those who don’t know, this is what we call a red flag. It wasn’t just that the Doc was speaking complete madness, but that she was talking about it like she did insects, with a mix of awe, excitement, and this strange look of longing. It was weird before, but seeing her do the same thing while talking about something so insane was genuinely terrifying. The second I heard it, I made up some excuse about having to work on a term paper or whatever and booked it outta there as fast as I could.

The strangest part was that the next day, she’s totally fine. She even took the day off to show me this cool specimen of assassin bug that’d just arrived from Colombia. I figured she wanted to pretend the other night didn’t happen, and I was perfectly fine with that. I didn’t want to throw everything away because of one weird night. So I played along, and pretty soon, we fell back into our same old routine.

Until two months later, when she came to me with big news, she’d decided to hold another one of her private expeditions, this time going straight into the heart of the Amazon in search of one thing: you can probably guess what. At first, I thought it was crazy, but on the other hand, getting to say I went on an actual research expedition would’ve done wonders for my career. That and she offered to pay me 2,500 dollars for just two weeks of work. 

One week later, I was on a plane heading to Brazil with fifteen different tetanus boosters and enough sunscreen to slather a whole city. Meet the Doc at the airport, and then it was off to the middle of the hot, humid hellhole that was the Amazon. Being there really strained my love of insects. Even in the car ride out to camp, I was swatting away mosquitos and the like every few seconds, so you can imagine how terrible the trek through the jungle was. Yeah, apparently, the road’s don’t go all the way to our campsite, so we had to hike through about five miles of moist, sweaty death. Even being under the shade didn’t help; if anything, it felt hotter. And the bugs, my God, the damn bugs. They would just not stop biting me. By the time we reached the camp, I looked like I was breaking out.

Ironically, or poetically or whatever, our camp was filled with all sorts of anti-bug measures. Bug nets, those tents that are suspended an inch above the ground, and enough bug spray to kill a rhinoceros which we smeared all over the place. Once we were sure every living thing in our camp was dead or dying, our work began. Whatever it was. Really, we just wandered around the woods, turning over stones, looking up trees, and just generally scavenging around the place. We found a lotta cool stuff, but no insects as big as people. Thought that might get the Doc to cool off, but no. A hundred herbs and spices of no.

The first sign that things were going wrong was the smell. Not that anyone smelled good being five hundred miles from the nearest shower, but Doc was the worst by far. It was the kinda odor that burned your throat if you took in too much and left that feeling lingering on your tongue long after it had passed. I honestly would have preferred sleeping next to a pile of jaguar shit than her.

It wasn’t long after that that she started looking worse for wear. We all tried to keep ourselves presentable despite the obvious challenges the jungle threw our way. All except for the Doc. Every day she’s dragged herself back to the camp covered in some new mystery stain. Some of them were even smeared across her face, and that wasn’t the worst of it. She started coming back with bruises or cuts, the kind you don’t go running to a hospital for but should at least let recover before going about your business. Not the Doc, though. It didn’t matter how bruised she got. Every morning, without fail, she’d pull herself out of bed and back into the woods.

Eventually, it got to the point where I had to try and talk her out of this, but she didn’t budge. She’d just look at me with this desperate look about her and say, “Not yet. It’s close. I can hear it.” Her answer was always something along those lines, which didn’t help my nerves. There wasn’t much I could do to stop her beyond tying her to a tree, so I just stayed close and made sure she didn’t get eaten by a panther. As the days carried on, though, I was starting to get worn down. I barely had time to eat between making sure Doc didn’t drop dead from dehydration, let alone sleep. She just kept staying out for longer and longer, even past sundown when the real nasty animals came out. I’m still amazed I didn’t get eaten by a jaguar. What did happen was that I lost ten pounds, sweat my weight in water, and was so sleep deprived I swear I started hallucinating. The Doc was spiraling bad, but I couldn’t let her take me down with her.

Stopped following her after a while and not a moment too soon. She started staying out longer and longer, not returning to camp until sunrise and carrying more of the forest with her every time. Mud and shit was just the start. It was the bugs that were the biggest problem. Every day she’d come stumbling back to camp with critters scuttling all over her. Some crawled through her hair, others stuck to her clothes like ticks and darted inside when we tried to pick them off, and some just plain stuck to the side of her face. Not that the Doc noticed, I’m sure. She didn’t even blink when this bigass centipede straight up crawled over her eye. All she did was stare ahead with this dead, exhausted expression and mutter, “I can hear it. I can hear it.”

This all kept getting worse and worse until one day, she stopped coming back at all. A day stretched into two, then four, and pretty soon, a whole week had passed with no sign of the Doc. The guides were convinced she’d gotten lost and fell down a ditch or something and were ready to pack it in, but I couldn’t just leave her out there in the middle of nowhere. I’d already let her march out into the middle of nowhere, and I wasn’t gonna leave her out there. So I took a few days of rations and set off into the jungle.

I didn’t expect the track to be easy, but I couldn’t imagine it’d be as difficult as it was. The heat alone was suffocating and turned my brain to mush in a moment. It was also that moist kind that sticks to your skin until you can’t tell if you’re sweating or if that’s just the humidity. The forest was no better. Everywhere you looked, there were leaves, vines, or some other form of God-forsaken foliage sticking its wavy arms in your face. And they just kept piling on top of each other until I swear they were trying to bury me. I couldn’t see more than a foot in front of me without having to brush aside some shrubbery, making it impossible to tell where I was. It was all so much that I barely spent an hour out there before I was ready to give up.

Then I heard the voice. You see, even at night, the jungle is full of insects all chirping away like there’s no tomorrow. It makes for great white noise, but the further I pushed into the jungle, the more the noise started to take on some sorta pattern. Not that something cut through the clammer like an alarm, but more like something twisted all the noise in the air until a single voice came through. Like the bugs were instruments that finally decided to harmonize. 

“*Jesse.*”

Nearly shit myself when I heard that. I spun all around, hoping it was the Doc I’d heard, but my only company was still the bugs. 

“*Jesse.*” 

It was louder that time, almost like the speaker was right next to me. I jumped away and swatted at where I swore the voice was coming from, only to hit another leaf. I wanted a second for the adrenaline and panic to kick in, but they never did. If anything, I felt calmer than I usually did. 

“*Jesse. Come closer, Jesse.*” 

I could hear the voice clearly by then, and it was downright soothing. Hearing it made my whole body relax like I’d plopped down on the world’s softest pillow. That voice was every sound you wanted to hear in your entire life. It made you feel like a child again, all safe and warm and comforted, like you were the center of everything and it all loved you. I couldn’t think straight anymore. I just wanted to listen.

“*This way.*”

I stumbled after the voice in a daze. Had no idea where I was going but towards that call waving itself through the buzzing of bugs. It carried me all throughout the forest while I was too doped up to care. Not sure how long I stayed like that, minutes, hours, days, but eventually, I found myself stepping in front of this real strange-looking tree. It was fucking huge, for a start, looking like a school bus turned on its side instead of a damn tree. The bark was also odd. It was smooth like stone and had this sickly gray color but was also adorned with these strange, flowing patterns that looked like the kind you’d find on the side of a wasp nest. It also didn’t have any leaves or flowers. Hell, I don’t even think it had branches. It just stretched upward forever and ever until it vanished somewhere in the canopy.

At the base of the tree was this large hole like the mouth of a cave. That was where the voice was coming from and coaxing me down into. Any other day I would’ve taken one look at the thick blanket of darkness filling the cave and ran like a chicken with its head cut off, but I was too doped up to care. The voice had gotten me, and it pulled me down into the tree. The tunnel down into this weird tunnel made from the tree’s roots. A tangled mess of wilted limbs held back the dirt and kept the whole thing from collapsing as I wandered through. The voice got louder with every step until the tunnel opened out into this gigantic cavern some miles below the surface.

I’ll never forget that place, swear to God. First thing I noticed down there: no light. Yet, somehow, I could still see. It’s hard to describe, but it was kinda like the darkness just wasn’t thick enough, like how a light can’t be bright enough. The place itself was essentially this giant dome of tangled roots that’d carved out this big ass empty space underground. I wasn’t alone down there either. I thought the branches might’ve been moving at first, but it turned out they were all covered in a thick layer of insects. They swarmed over the walls, millions of different species all mingling and twisting their bodies past each other. Swear every bug in the Amazon must’ve been down there, but I didn’t pay too much attention to tell.

“*Just a little closer, Jesse.*”

My eyes were pulled down to the floor, or at least what should have been one. Instead, there was this knee-deep swamp of mud and filth stretching from every corner of the space to the next. Regardless of how disgusting that was, I was pulled into the gunk without hesitation and slowly guided through the bog. There was something in there, too, I swear. Every so often, my legs would scrap past something hard only to feel it scuttle away and into the murky depths. I tried telling myself it was just a tadpole or something that’d accidentally made its way down here, but even as zonked out as I was, I knew better. Didn’t stop me, though. Not with that voice in my ears.

It guided me through the water until my feet came smacking against something sticking to the bottom. 

“*Yes. Now reach, Jesse.*”

I reached my hands down into that muck and grabbed hold of whatever was down there. It didn’t give at first, but after a good minute of pulling, I managed to tear the little bastard out of the ground. Pulling it outta the water, I saw that it was a cocoon of some sort, but not like any I’d ever seen before. It was easily the size of my fist and the same color of raw flesh still bloody from a kill. Streaming off from the bottom were these long root-like appendages with the same complexion as the rest of the plant life down there with globs of the mud they had clung to. These ridges were sticking out of it, too, like ribs poking through a gaunt belly, and inside, I could make out something moving. A dark shape that scuttled through the fluid inside and came to rest up against where my hand gripped the cocoon. 

“*Partake of us, Jesse. Our First Born chrysalis. Within you, we may wander far from here.*”

I raised the cocoon up over my head, letting its roots dangle over my open maw. Just before I could eat the damn thing, something came running through the mud and slammed right into me. I was sent flying through the mud and came crashing down beneath the muck, dropping the cocoon somewhere along the way. During it all, I think I must have been literally knocked outta my trance because I was myself again by the time I scurried onto my feet. Couldn’t say the same for my attacker, though.

“Get back!!” The Doc screamed at me, clutching the cocoon tight to her chest. “Get the fuck back!!”

I probably would have said something if I wasn’t so blown back by her appearance. She looked back before, but that was nothing compared to what I saw then. Her clothes were little more than tattered fabric caked in dirt, detritus, and bloodstains. Ripes in the fabric were complimented by cuts along her skin, most of which were swollen with pus. Her wiry hair sprung out in all directions, having caught various specks of leaves and rock in what must have been a terrible trek through the woods. Worst yet were the bugs. There had to be hundreds of them, each scurrying across her bare skin weaving through the tattered remains of her clothes. Some, and I swear I’m not making this up, even poked at her wounds before scuttling inside the cuts. She was absolutely infested with the little demons, and I don’t even think she knew it. 

She glared at me with more hatred than I thought a human being could possibly express and spat out, “I heard it! You hear me!? ME!! Not you! Not anyone! I heard it!” 

Only then she snapped her wild eyes down to the cocoon in her arms and let all that visceral hatred melt away. “You know that.” She said with a voice like that of a Mom talking to a baby. “You know I can hear you. Of course, you do.” A pause followed as if she were listening to something, but all I could hear was the random chirping of the insects covering the cavern walls. A smile crossed the Doc’s face before she raised the cocoon over her own head and, in one swift motion, swallowed the damn thing whole. For a single, excruciating moment, nothing happened. The Doc simply stood there looking like she was trying not to vomit, yet somehow also appeared to be in a state of unrivaled ecstasy. However long it felt, it was still only a moment, and soon, the serenity was broken.

A terrible crack rang out as the Doc’s gut suddenly thrust forward, making the rest of her snap back in response. A quick groan escaped her before she seemed to freeze in this twisted posture. Another crack rang out as her arms twisted in their cocks, breaking nearly every bone within them, eliciting a haunting scream from the Doc. More and more cracks rang throughout the room as her bones broke themselves in every way imaginable. Bruises bloomed all over her skin as the points of shattered bone began poking through and distorting it. It seemed like she was trying to tear herself apart, but I guess that would only be half right.

She looked at me right in the end. There was pain in her eyes, to be sure, but also something far worse: joy. Joy at every twist of her flesh and happiness at the torture she was going through. No. Not happiness. Desperation. This savagery had to be joyful because it was all there was now.

But then her eyes slid out of sync, each one staring off in another direction as a great gash began to run down her body. It started at her head, cleaving her nose and mouth right down the middle, and continued down her body, blood leaking onto her clothes. The gash grew deeper and wider, either side pulling them apart until her whole body was torn down the middle. A great geyser of blood erupted out in every direction, staining the mud with a crimson so deep it was almost black. Her clothes were torn to shreds from the sheer force of the act, except for that which clung to her cervix. I saw the gash stopped just below her gut, where the two halves of her body meet, and expected to see what was left of her organs come pooling down into the bottom of the canyon.

Instead, there were no guts. There wasn’t even a wound. Though her body had been split down the middle, her organs couldn’t be seen on the inside of each half. Instead, there lay a thick layer of skin covering what should have been monstrous wounds. The halves swayed back and forth like the heads of snakes, the Doc’s eyes staring vapidly from them. 

The transformation didn’t stop here. Either half began to quiver and shake as if fighting to stitch the many broken bones within them back together. The skin seemed to ripple as something moved under, an exoskeleton I had so often seen out in the woods and one that fought against the body it emerged from. Sometimes the flesh just melted into the skeleton, but other parts refused to give way to such mutations. Instead, they were violently torn apart to make room for the new body surging from the Doc’s mangled form.

The right half seemed to have the least resistant to the change. Her flesh melted into the hard shell beneath, fingers and joints disappearing into what I now recognize as a long, jagged mandible like a mantis. The shell was the color of meat, but with occasional spots of deep green that seemed like a mocking attempt to appear normal. A boil of some sort took root on the side of the head just next to the ear and was quick to grow, subsuming the surrounding body. The eye acted similarly, swelling to meet the size of the boil as the last shreds of humanity faded from it. The irises vanished into a sea of reflective combs, which housed in them an alien intelligence. The rest melted away into a mess of pincers until the half of a head had grown into that of a fully formed mantis. The rest of the body seemed to have followed this suit, with the arm absorbed into the giant pincer now extending from a rigid, insecticide body.

However, the left side didn’t have as easy of a time. The skin and meat below bulged as the parts within fought for escape. Bones and flesh could be seen swirling within, a by-product of the creature’s struggle; eventually, the pincer within tore through the underarms and extended itself out like the edge of a switchblade springing to full length. In fact, the pincer looked to be extending out of her open palm, which clung vestigial to the upper side of the new limbs. Fingers dangled from the arm, and I swore that I could see them moving every so often. The rest of the left side followed a similar route, with the creature flexing every way it could as it tore through the Doc’s body. 

What I’ll remember above all else, however, is what happened to the head. It didn’t break as easily as the rest. Instead, the skin stretched out to accommodate the mantis head growing within until it looked as those the creature wore the Doc’s face in a demented mockery. Worst of all, I saw it move. The eye, I mean. It didn’t twitch or roll around aimlessly, no. It fucking moved. The eye swung itself all around in alarm, only to focus on me in a silent plea to save her from whatever horror was eating its way out of her. I know there was nothing I could have done, but she didn’t. Instead, she spent her last few moments begging for help that would never come while her body was torn to pieces.

First to go was her mouth. Mandibles pressed against the inside, pushing at her limbs and gums until they burst free and promptly began scooping pieces of the mouth into its own, literally eating their way through her. The skin pulled tight against the eyes finally exploded, letting that thing take its first look at the world around it. But stretching over the shell between the eyes and mouth was a blanket of human skin containing that single eye. It hadn’t stopped moving the entire time. 

By the time it was done, the only human part left of the Doc was her legs. Two mantis torsos sprouted from her hips. The one on the left was missing its right arm, and the one on the right was missing its left, leaving a canyon of empty space between the two. In a strange way, they seemed to complete the other, each taking control of the arm on their respective side of the body.

I, on the other hand, did what any sane and rational person would do after witnessing all that. I screamed. At the top of my lungs and like I was waiting for my Daddy to come and beat the monster up. The creature, whatever in God’s name it was, snapped its head towards me and glared down with this cold intensity. The worst part was I knew it wasn’t angry ever as I cried out like a damn toddler. There was only one thing in those eyes: hunger. 

But it didn’t pounce on me. Not yet. Instead, it turned its head and stretched its pincers towards the ceiling. It let out a cry that sounded like glass slicing through flesh that echoed all the way up to the roof. My ears burned just from listening, and I slapped my hands over them, wishing I could’ve gouged them out instead. When the creature’s howl was finished, the entire cavern began to shake as if an earthquake were tearing through the ground. I could’ve sworn the whole place was coming down on top of me, but something much worse happened instead.

The roots above me began to let a long string of thunderous cracks. I shot my eyes upward as a pair of massive, black limbs came slithering out from between the roots. Each of them was the size of tree trunks and were anything but human. They were long, spindly, and covered in an exoskeleton from which sprouted dozens of hairs. The limbs twisted themselves back up and began pulling back the roots like the folds of a curtain. Bugs were tossed from the rootwork by the hundred, causing them to rain down on the cavern. I’m pretty sure some of them hit me, but I was too shell-shocked at the time to notice. All I could do was gaze up in open-mouthed horror at what came emerging from the dirt behind the roots.

It was much bigger than a man. Not even sure how that comparison was made. All things considered, it could have crushed fifty people under its head alone. The rest of it, fuck, maybe a whole village. It looked like some odd mix between a bee, wasp, and ant, all bundled together in a giant exoskeleton colored a red so dark it was almost black. Its compound eyes had been drained of even the tiniest shred of humanity, looking more like a robot of twisted meat and clicking limbs. 

In place of a stinger, a cluster of roots extended from the tip of her abdomen and stretched off into the dirt. Each of them was identical to the roots, with the same sickly gray coloration and the same patterns running across it. They weren’t even roots at all, and it wasn’t a tree I had been lured to at all. It was her nest, and all it led back to her.

The critters swarming throughout the hive cried out in reverence as the creature from above descended from the ceiling. The mantis creature, a “Firstborn,” as I think it is called, raised its pincers up to its Mother, further tearing through its host’s body. It added its own clicks to the choir that erupted throughout the room, and within it all, I heard the voice come howling out, “*Mother. Child. Siblings. Welcome.*”

Something began to stir in the mud below after those words were spoken. I saw shapes moving within, just barely skimming the surface enough to cause a disruption. Then, bodies began to rise from the muck with only the faintest hint of human traits. There must have been dozens of them in total, each a different species of body, but all growing out of what had once been a human body. Centipede legs burst from the spines of one and forced the body to bend backward as a head slithered out of an eternally open maw. A wasp-like creature in the distance had a human torso with hands and arms instead of front feet, and ahead with the lower jaws torn off from which sprouted an insectoid head. 

There was a fucking family of these things, and I was trapped right in the middle of them. I was beyond scared at that point. I was fucking mortified. My heartbeat against my ribs, trying to flee this nightmare. The fire in my veins burned through my frozen limbs and sent me rocketing forward through the gunk. 

I’m not too sure what happened next, though. Everything after just sorta dissolves into this weird, feverish blur of adrenaline and fear. All I knew was that I was doing my best to duck and weave between those abominations, which worked for a bit since they were too busy talking to mommy. After a while, though, they all started turning towards me with those soulless eyes and mangled bodies. Some of them lunged for me, I think. Pretty sure I had to punch a few too, but I’m not gonna act like that’s what saved me in the end. The cavern was massive, but I was pretty close to the edge, so I don’t think I had to run for long to get out. That and I think those bugs were pulling their punches. I was right in the thick of them. Anyone could have killed me, but I don’t think that’s what they wanted. Heck, I doubt they were even trying to hurt me. Don’t wanna damage the goods, after all.

So I got out. Not sure it was up to me, though. I raced into the tunnel and booked it all the way up and out into the jungle. Didn’t stop there either. I just kept running and running and running, swatting away whatever foliage got in my way. I only had one idea of where I was going: away from that damn tree and whatever nightmares lurked under. Bad idea because, as it turns out, panic running doesn’t mix well with borderline dehydration. Not sure when I passed out, but I definitely did. One minute I’m running through the forest; the next, I’m lying in a hospital bed. 

Turns out, a bunch of the guides from my camp got worried about me and decided to peruse the jungle bit. If you ask me, they were more worried about not getting paid, but regardless, they managed to find me passed out under a tree somewhere. Brought me to a hospital not long after which I woke up. They asked about what happened to the Doc, the greedy bastards, but I didn’t believe any of it myself. As delirious as I was, between the exhaustion and exposure, I still ain’t positive I haven’t made it all up. Anyways, I got better before long, used what money the Doc had left to pay my way back home, and here we are.

No one’s heard from the Doc since, and I ain’t holding my breath. She’s dead, I hope. It’d be better than still being alive, trapped inside whatever the fuck that thing was. Everyone else just assumes she went crazy and got lost out in the woods. Given all that shit she spouted about giant insects, it wasn’t too hard to sell. As for me, I got my old job back, started school again, and just sorta moved on. Not entirely, though.

I’m not a bug guy anymore. Can’t look at the damn things anymore, and it’s not for the reason you’re thinking. I am still haunted by what I saw out there in the forest. Every time I close my fucking eyes, I see the Doc getting torn to pieces from the inside out, but that’s not why I can’t stand bugs anymore. It’s because I can. Stand them, I mean. This rush of excitement floods through me if I so much as see a fly now, more so than before I went into that jungle. And if I listen closely to the chirping of crickets or buzzing of bees, I can hear that voice whispering to me. Every bug I find fills me with that same dopey warmth that the voice does. It makes me want to find that thing again, the Mother of Vermin, and this time, follow through. It’s hard to describe. It’s not like there’s a voice in the back of my head that’s telling me to go back. It’s just me, my soul, or whatever, and I don’t know how much longer I can resist.

It’s gotten worse the last week. Everywhere I go, there’s some tiny insect huddled in the background that doesn’t let me forget about what I saw. Worst yet, they always make me smile because of it. And in their little buzzing’s and chirps, I hear that sweet voice calling to me. I think I’ll go soon. Not sure when, but before I do, I wanna leave something behind. So here it all is. My insane ramblings or final testimony. You decide. Just don’t fall for the same thing me and the Doc did. You hear her voice out in the woods, you fucking run. Because once you’re invited into that family, you’ll never want to leave."
u89rg3,5,2022-04-20,I got ghosted from an internship because I was going to school,mariminami,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/u89rg3/i_got_ghosted_from_an_internship_because_i_was/,"Its almost been a year since this and its made me think a lot. this was a paid internship just fyi

So I am a designer and I earned my BFA last year in May 2021. I decided to get an internship Feb-March of that year. It was for an athletic company in the corporate office. They also had a few stores around the state I was in. (Also sorry im going to be vague on purpose just so I don't out them)

Interview went great. The person I was working under was an alumni of the school I was about to graduate from. I let them know that I was still in school but id graduate in May. They said great and that I can come in and work a couple times a week to help out the main designer and pitch ideas.

the first few weeks were okay. I designed some things for them that were used and they seemed to like my stuff a lot. I was also very fast to giving them ideas and finishing projects I was given. I wasn't given a lot of work to do, but I made the most out of the things I was assigned. I would tend to overcompensate and give them more than what they asked since I had the time.

a month went by, and I truly felt like I was being ignored or forgotten about. I had my own office space, my own email, my own everything pretty much. I would check in on my ""supervisor"" and ask about the week. she would let me know what was going on, but wouldn't exactly give me things to do. Everything seemed to be stressful for her. Like I couldn't do anything she was assigned or at least take some off her plate. Also, every time she ""needed"" me were during the days I had class. I would let them all know to email me what they need even if I had class days.

It got to a point where I felt like I was pulling teeth being there. I would show up and do things they would ask me that just didn't end up being used. I would design things for them that they wanted day 1, and brush it off like I was ridiculous for working on such a thing. I truly dreaded going to this place but hey it was my first job that I got that was in my field other than freelance.

A few weeks before my graduation, and my boss calls me in and says that today would be my last day because of the ""lag"" of communication that gets to me. I didn't seem to understand how she meant since I was able to be emailed whenever. I wish I stuck up for myself that day, but I just held back tears because I felt like I failed and left. However, she did say that she would contact me after I graduated since I'd have more free time and I would come back.

two weeks goes by, I graduate, and I email them. Nothing. I don't even know what I could have done wrong. I have thought about this for so long and wonder if I did something or I didn't show enough eagerness. Has anyone gone though something like this or does this seem familiar to someone else? 

Thanks for reading if anyone does!"

I’m trying to optimize for the resume screening round, and even though Cockroach Labs’ intern projects are freaking amazing, I’m quite afraid of its reputation among recruiters (they’re popular in a niche way).

So after that interview, I was emailed a link to a code test. Code test was phenomenally easy for me but there was only one glaring issue... The code test had language requirements. Now that normally wouldn't have been an issue but the big problem here is that the recruiter never mentioned that there would be a language requirement and also conveniently failed to mention that I needed working knowledge in those languages in order to complete the test.

The code test required a working knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, and C#. I can proudly say the C# part was the easier for me (not to brag but C, C++, C#, Python, Golang under my belt), but I have no working knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JS nor do I have any drive to learn them. If I had known that the internship/code test absolutely required me to having a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, &amp; JS, I would've dropped my candidacy for the internship.

After the rejection email, I wrote back an email to the head of HR about this issue given that I was basically set up to fail. Have any of you guys had an issue like or similar to this?"
u8aqu6,1,2022-04-20,I’ve not been happy the last few years and I know I can change that but I just need my feelings acknowledged.,Anonchovies,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/u8aqu6/ive_not_been_happy_the_last_few_years_and_i_know/,"I can trace the source of my unhappiness to when I started college. I was accepted into two colleges and knew which I preferred over the other. My parents asked if I could go to the one closer to home for financial reasons. Understandably so. My family lives comfortably but our finances weren’t always the best. So I agreed out of respect and courtesy to my parents who I dearly love. This college however was not the college I wanted to attend.

Fast forward to halfway through first year in college, my parents asked me if I’d be interested in changing majors. They were concerned I would need a masters with my current major to find full time jobs whereas the one they proposed could easily start with just a undergrad degree. It wasn’t too far away from my current degree so it made sense and I agreed. So I switched. 

My 4th and final year in college, I received two offers: one for a full time position and the other for an internship. I was more interested in the internship and it was much more related to my degree. My parents suggested I go with the full time as I would be more financially secure and I could always pursue the other career path down the line. I accepted the full time position. I disappointedly turned down the internship. 

In the fall of my graduation year, I went to buy my very first car since I would be working and moving for my job. I didn’t want anything too fancy or even brand new since I was just starting out. My parents who wanted to go with me said I should buy a brand new car especially with safety features. I did so. 

When I moved cities, my parents directed me to the nicer part of town because it was a safer area despite rent being a little higher. Of course this made sense so I agreed.

When my job transitioned to work from home, my parents offered to let me move back in. I was grateful because I would be saving so much on rent money. However, I’m still in debt for student loans, paying off my car, credit cards, etc.

For everyday of my life since starting college, I had been convincing myself that yes I’m on the right track and this is what’s best. I was fortunate that I had my parents guiding me. Deep down I feel that my major life decisions were not my own and it was all to respect or agree with my parents. 

I am beyond grateful to have two loving parents who only care for my well being and for my safety. And for them to support me through college was a blessing. I am thankful. I just wish I had the guts to disagree from time to time and chose paths that I wanted.

Yes disagreeing with my parents suggestions would’ve caused tension (already know that at least one of them gets upset when you disagree) but I now wish I was at a different place in my life. I’m unhappy with my life decisions and I can’t change them. I know I have control over the future so I should focus on that but I still feel like I missed out."

u8cuq1,2,2022-04-20,Remote EECS 281 in the spring,afakecsmajor,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/u8cuq1/remote_eecs_281_in_the_spring/,"Hey, I'm a freshman majoring in math and CS and I am debating whether to take EECS 281 in the spring half-term. I've thought of the following pros and cons:

Pros:

* I've failed to land an internship or research or anything systematic for the spring/summer, so this would be a good formal avenue of giving me something to do.
* I would be needing to start learning DS&amp;A on my own even if I decided against taking 281 in the spring, to lighten a possibly steep fall courseload (looking at 15 credits + UROP).
* Having 281 done would help me greatly in the fall recruiting cycle, at least as I've heard. I would probably be recruiting quant, SWE, and the like, though I don't really have a direction yet.
* Taking 281 in the spring allows me to comfortably take 370 and 376 in the fall and ULCS starting my fourth semester, which makes scheduling courses a lot more straightforward moving ahead.

Cons:

* My biggest worry is that I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle the 30 hour per week workload (CS overload), especially since I'd be a bit burned out following exams and only have a week to recharge. This is a particularly important class, too, and I want to learn it as well as I can and get an A, which I don't think going at double pace is conducive to.
* I do not have any plans to be on campus in the spring, and I don't think that'd be worth it just for this one class. I would likely be taking 281 remotely, in which case I suppose labwork, ease of asking questions, and especially social interaction would be hindered. I live close enough to AA that I can commute for the in-person exams but far enough that I wouldn't be coming for anything else.
* I'm already on pace to graduate exactly one semester early, and taking 281 in the spring doesn't change that, though tbf in the long run $3k isn't much.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

Pros for Georgia Tech:

* Amazing program for my intended major (information technology management) (ranked #5 in the US)
* Great opportunities for top internships/job prospects (elite consulting firms, big tech, and startups all recruit on campus, Atlanta’s opportunities are endless).
* Collaborative classroom environment (students/faculty willing to help/aid with success).
* Amazing campus/surrounding environment, state-of-the-art buildings/facilities.
* More prestigious/brand name. 

Cons for Georgia Tech:

* Cost ($220k total as an out-of-state student, no scholarships/financial aid awarded)
* More competitive academic environment. I will be considered an “average student” at GT, therefore I’m competing with other high-achieving students for top job/internship opportunities.
* Intensive workload (Georgia tech is notorious for a super rigorous curriculum, exams are super stressful with time-consuming work/study schedules). 

Pros for Temple:

* Presidential Scholar (full-tuition scholarship, $60k total cost for 4 years)
* Direct admission into fox honors (super exclusive cohort of business students, around 75 total kids per grade, less than 5% accepted)
* Fox honors = direct/unlimited access to top faculty, professors, and advisors to help effortlessly network for internships and jobs. Can get rec letters from top faculty and won't have to grind nearly as much for top opportunities. 
* Also get smaller class sizes and priority registration (Class sizes are capped at 25-30 students, will never have to worry about not getting a class of choice).
* Location (absolutely love Philly): Philly by far one of my fav cities, good consulting/banking opportunities, and close proximity to other northeastern cities.

Cons for Temple:

* Not as strong for my major (information systems/technology).
* Less opportunity for elite consulting firms, big tech, or small tech startups (ATL def a much stronger tech presence, but big 4 consulting is easily attainable in Philly).
* Not as much prestige or as well branded as Georgia tech."
u8fltr,2,2022-04-21,"For any junior DevOps folks out there, get comfortable with being absolutely clueless :)",lambarlion,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/u8fltr/for_any_junior_devops_folks_out_there_get/,"So I started a DevOps internship with a  cybersecurity firm roughly 5 months ago. My internship is gonna be over pretty shortly and I got the confirmation that they're going to be hiring me on full time. I've been lurking on this subreddit since the beginning of my internship constantly searching the key words ""stress"" &amp; ""too much to learn"" in the search header lol.

I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. DevOps is definitely not a role someone can just transition to in the course of several months. There's so much knowledge and expertise across different domains needed just to be able to do your job decently. On top of that, I had pretty much little to no prior experience doing development work. I did setup a couple servers on IBM cloud and did some small automation stuff to download anime torrents but that was about it.

My internship was extremely stressful. I spent a bunch of time outside of work and on the weekends just to stay afloat. I always constantly felt behind and my manager had very high expectations of me. I went from not knowing how to make a simple GET request to building out an API that connects connecting multiple pipelines and cloud services. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting very miniscule stuff like my script wasn't working because I wasn't in the right directory etc. I didn't get much help from my co-workers because they were always extremely busy so I got a ton of help from a lot of people online and bombarding stackoverflow. 

I still feel extremely overwhelmed with my workload , but I've gotten a lot more comfortable with the process of learning how to find the right answers and asking the right questions. I'm really happy with how far I've came and for individuals out there who are seeking an entry level role in DevOps, I would highly recommend you to read the Phoenix project, study the architecture behind a couple DevOps tools, get your hands dirty by doing some hands off and know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. 

Coming from poverty, getting a full time job doing something that I find really cool and pays well is pretty bonkers to me. Now I just want to wrap up my comp sci degree, continue to learn as much as I can and spend my weekends doing some leisure activities. 

Here's a brief itinerary of my internship experience.

1st Month:

\- Read and update documentation

\- Build some basic pipelines

2nd Month:

\- Shadow with another engineer on building an automated solution

\- Got into some trouble for just shadowing and not contributing to engineers work

3rd Month:

\- Build an automation solution for a niche use case

\- Destroy the automated solution because it's no longer needed

4th Month:

\- Work on building the automated solution again because business needs have changed and create an API for this automated solution for organization to use

5th Month:

\- Configure this API to connect with multiple cloud services. Interview with different stakeholder on different use cases for this automated solution 

\- Bathe in glory

\- Go back to gym cuz I gained a crap ton of weight lol"

I JUST started looking into jobs and applied to a few I wasn't that interested in with the intention of practicing technical interviews but I got one much faster than expected and I'm totally unprepared and freaking out about it. I feel like I forget everything from taking such a long break and I've also never coded in front of people for an interview before. Even though I have had paid internships where I was coding they only asked me culture fit questions or pseudocode on a whiteboard.

I should have studied more before applying but deadlines were coming up and I need a job... I figured I would study while waiting at least a week or so IF I even got a call. I feel like I'm wasting their time but it's too late to reschedule/cancel.

Anyway, my anxiety is winning and I just want to hear that if I can't answer a single question I'll be ok.

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for the support! I didn't expect to hear back from so many people. I didn't do too bad, I guess things are never as bad as you make them out to be in your head. I panicked at the beginning and blanked so hard I somehow forgot how to initiate an array... But once I got over that I solved the problem, it was pretty basic leetcode. I was honest with them like some of you suggested and told them it was my first coding interview ever and they were supportive and told me it was pretty good for my first one. I have a final 'panel' interview which will be 4 hours long. I'm not sure what that means yet but I'm back to studying! Thank you guys again so much it meant a lot reading all the words of encouragement right before the interview. "

The pay method is a w2 as for benefits after 60 days I will be available for some benefits(healthcare by the way of the staffing agency).  There is no mention of temp to hire or anything of the like. I will receive a check every 2 weeks.

My current job is working in a travel center as a cashier, I get full benefits(vacations, healthcare, vision,dental, etc). The pay from the contract job would be a 50% increase from my current payrate. There is no real way for me to currently go up with my current employer.

Gexie was having a shit fuckin' day, to say the least. But he supposed it was a damn good learning experience about ""the duality of Man,"" as Ryan called it. He jes' kinda wished it wasn't by getting dragged out of a vent, tied up and having a gun pointed at him. His shoulders were still sore from the rough handling of his arms, and his wrists were less than comfortable with the inexplicably tough and tight pieces of plastic tied around them. He thought he remembered 'em being called ""zip ties,"" but he wasn't a hundred percent sure on that one. 


After getting dragged out of the vent as he tried (and failed) to escape with Ryan, he was shoved into the corner with the rest. And there he had sat with everyone else, overlooked by a pirate wielding one of the brutal kinetic weapons humans favored. Until gunfire went off on the other side of the ship, distracting the guard. 


*Fuck it,* he decided. *Now or never, Gexie.*


_


Director Hu fumed at the status report. 


""That man is a loose end to Humanity as a whole. If you don't dispose of him, he will end up throwing humanity to the *wolves!*"" she shouted at Agent Bowler over his radio. Things were, irritatingly, not going as smoothly as they should have. Hu could not blame the man for Ryan's surprise disappearance from the sleeping quarters, however she *could* reinform the man of what the stakes were. If Ryan decided to join the Collective, or, more accurately, *when*, then she had no doubt that Humanity's secrets would spill from him like an open wound. 


Whether by his intention or not, the man was a threat to his entire species. As such, he had to be neutralized. Hu had to argue against many a high-ranking former western world intelligence agent to push such drastic measures through in such a short timeframe, but they eventually agreed, or, at least, agreed to look the other way in regards to sending their newly acquired pirates to deal with the threat. Hu listened in to the radios with a growing impatience. Sooner or later, the man would be-...


Her thoughts were interrupted by a gunshot echoing across the radios. A gunshot from a gun that she distinctly knew was not among the pirates' armaments. It was from a Glock-85 that she had thought Ryan had left on Earth. Her scowl deepened. This… This complicated things.


_


Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which had led to him shooting a pirate in the head. 


*Holy shit, I just fucking killed someone,* he realized. He didn't stop and hesitate when he pulled the trigger; the basic training made sure to drill that much out of him. But now… he looked at the blood splatter across the communications equipment, the lifeless corpse bleeding onto the ground in horror. The corpse laid there… and… weakly groaned in pain? 


*Holy shit he's alive,* Ryan pieced together after a few seconds. He sighed in relief before coming to his senses. Ryan quickly kicked the submachine gun away before the pirate got any funny ideas. Whoever he was didn't respond to his weapon being flung away, opting instead to gently touch the side of his head than respond. It was obvious that the pirate wasn't going to die from it, but he certainly seemed out for the count at the moment.


*Okay, it looks like it was a glancing blow…* he thought to himself as the pirate weakly stirred. *Thank God,* part of him rejoiced. Ryan wasn't sure how alright he'd be with his first account of murder. There wasn't any hole, just a deep gash on the side of the man's head that looked to be bleeding. On the bright side, he most definitely wasn't going anywhere any time soon with a concussion like that, so Ryan had time to send out a distress signal. He quickly set to work, calling back to his earlier time here while he got acquainted with the ship. 


*Thank, you, Gexie,* he thought to himself as he sent the signal. The man had made sure Ryan was prepared for an event like this, and evidently, it was paying off. The signal broadcasted a pirate attack out to anyone who would listen. Now, Ryan had to get the hell out of dodge and hope for the best. He sprinted out of the room, snagging himself an MP5 on the way out.


_


Eleanor didn't need any more than the gunshot to know things weren't going to plan. Immediately, he requested backup from Nikolai. Dmitri could finish clearing the place on his own; Eleanor didn't particularly desire to have to watch prisoners *and* his back. 


""Nikolai, get over here. I need you on my six,"" he demanded. Prisoners and hostages were always a wildcard, and Eleanor didn't need a knife in the back right now. He swapped his gun between the prisoners and the door. 


*So far, so good. No one's tried anything funny,* he thought to himself. As a matter of fact… the prisoners were a bit *too* quiet. He looked over, making a quick headcount. Eleanor found himself an embuos short. He growled in frustration. Grabbing a small human from the crowd and pointing an MP5 just under his jaw, he shouted at the crowd.


""Any of you try anything, he bites the fucking bullet, you hear?"" They nodded an affirmative like a group of terrified schoolchildren. ""Now tell me where the fuck he went!"" They all looked around hesitantly. ""NOW!"" he shouted, pressing the barrel of the gun against the poor guy's jaw. One among them slowly pointed to the vent. *Of fucking course*. Looking at it, he saw a glimpse of a reptilian tail flicking out of view. *God fucking damnit,* he cursed. Eleanor couldn't afford to pursue. Not with a prisoner and no backup. He radioed in. 


""One of the lizards snuck through the vent. I need backup ASAP,"" he demanded. 


""Oh, do you now???"" Alexei shouted over the sound of plasma fire. ""Hostiles onboard, stay mobile. There isn't cover good enough to protect you from plasma shots. Sorry, boss, the mission is fucked,"" he apologized insincerely, firing back a few rounds. The distinct sound of an energy shield failing echoed over the radio. ""Got one!"" Alexei cheered.


""*Bollocks,*"" Agent cursed. ""Get to the pods. Don't get left behind. Alexei, sabotage the engines best you can,"" he ordered. ""We'll wait for you, but anyone not here by the time Alexei gets back gets left behind,"" he warned. Eleanor chuckled. 


""Looks like your cavalry's here, folks,"" he informed the prisoners. ""Bon voyage, as Louise loves to say."" He sprinted to the escape pods that the six of them had come in on. He was about halfway to their escape pods when Eleanor realized they had meant the escape pods of the new ship. Oh well. In his opinion, these ones were better, anyways. More human. He expertly set course back to the ship. 


""Takin' one of our pods back. See ya in a bit, boss,"" he informed. 


""Alright. Now. Status report, Louise,"" Agent demanded. All the reply he received was a weak groan. 


""... Enfoiré pulled a gun on me. Thought you said he was going to be *unarmed*,"" Louise complained. ""Didn't know I'd have to keep my guard up."" The man didn't sound like he was in the best of shape.


""You good, Louise?"" Eleanor interrogated.


""Yeah. Took a bullet to the side of the head and can't see straight right now, but I can get to the pods.""


""Nikolai?"" Agent asked.


""Got to one of our pods. Headed back to ship, sir,"" he informed.


""Dmitri's in a pod. Alexei?"" he asked.


""Fending them off, but I've sabotaged the engines. If I remember how all this works correctly, the ship will be sent on a random FTL vector within its database. If we stay within it's warp bubble, we will go with it. Best I could do under the circumstances,"" he informed. 


_


""Good to know. Get back here, now."" Bowler demanded.


The sound of plasma and rifle fire told Bowler Alexei was already on his way.


""Hah! Ten marks, and I got some personal shields for the crew,"" he bragged.


""Good work. Hand me the rest, Alexei."" He quickly palmed Bowler five small discs. As Bowler stuffed them in his pocket, the mob of snakes slithered past the corner, providing a wall of fire in the prone position. Shit. The shots bounced off of Alexei's shield until it broke with the sound of shattering glass. As Alexei scrambled into his pod, a round caught him in the ankle. 


""AGH! CYKA,"" he cursed over the radio as the door to his pod closed. ""FUCK, that shit burns!"" Bowler shot off in his escape pod going a different direction, keeping the targets sparse for any kind of anti-air they could have had floating around. Controlling the alien ship was difficult to get a hang of, but he managed it just in time to duck under a tractor beam. The shouting on the radio informed him that Alexei was not so lucky.


""Fuck, they got me!"" he shouted. Bollocks. Bowler brought out the tablet he had brought with him, selecting Alexei. The small bomb detonated, killing its target instantly in a precise cylindrical blast of plasma.


_


Louise was the last to leave. And he was going to be damned if he got left behind. He waited around the corner as the embuos police… or military? Whatever they were, to move on. Nikolai was still fighting his way out, providing a necessary distraction. A large chunk of the guards split off towards their entry room. Louise brandished his sidearm, making sure the M22 pistol was loaded and ready. Nikolai's antique SAW rattled off in the distance, and from the radio, it was most certainly only him and Nikolai still on board. Which led to the most delightful discovery of Louise's own MP5 peeking around the doorway, failing to check its immediate corners. As the *batard* that shot Louise walked right by him, he jammed his pistol's barrel right under the fuck's jaw.


""Well, well, well. If it isn't the little fucking shit who shot me,"" he taunted. ""Thank you for being such a neatly wrapped little exit ticket for me."" He pushed the man forward as he dropped Louise's gun. ""The pistol, too, while you're at it,"" he commanded, pushing his own sidearm against his hostage's jaw. Slowly, Dirty Blonde threw his pistol to the side, next to the MP5. He forced his prisoner towards the escape pods. The first embuos recognized him as he walked his prisoner through the halls. 


""Stay back or the *tête de noued* gets a bullet in the skull!"" he threatened. The lizards kept their guns up, but gave him room. ""Now get the hell out,"" he demanded. 


""You don't have to do this,"" pleaded one of the soldiers. ""One way or another, we're going to catch you. Just turn yourself in, and no one needs to get hurt."" In reply, Louise fired three bursts into the snake, shattering his shields and ripping into his scaled flesh.


""NO!"" yelled Dirty Blonde in protest, trying to wrestle out of his grasp. Louise tightened his forearm around the struggling *le con*'s neck before slamming open a pod and tossing Dirty Blonde forward. He couldn't help but savor the rage in his eyes as the man jumped at Louise right as the doors closed.


_


Ryan swore at the top of his lungs. He didn't care if there was no sound in the vacuum of space, he was going to shout loud enough that that fucking rat knew what Ryan said.


""YOU FUCKING PRICK! GET BACK HERE! I'M GONNA FILL YOUR FUCKING LUNGS WITH CONCRETE, YOU HEAR ME!?"" He slammed his fist against the glass as the pod shot off. FUCK! Ryan should have killed that fucking pirate scum when he had the chance! He realized the one officer was likely bleeding out, and he refocused his attention. The embuos that had gotten shot was still bleeding across the floor. Ryan slid right to the snake's side.


""Shit! Shit! Hey! You're gonna be alright, yeah?"" he asked, putting pressure on the bullet wound to where the sternum would be located on a human. There was another wound to the arm, but that wasn't bleeding nearly as much as the one on his main body. Ryan kept up the pressure, shouting ""MEDIC!"" to anyone who could hear him. The blood kept coming, gushing more and more through his fingers. He shouted out again.


""MEDIC, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!"" The embuos' eyes began to roll back.


""Hey hey hey, no, stay with me. Stay with-..."" Ryan stopped speaking as he realized the blood had stopped pulsing through his fingers. The embuos' heart had completely stopped."
u8gm9e,1,2022-04-21,Negligent Auto Repair,Turtlevoyager1nova,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/u8gm9e/negligent_auto_repair/,"Tl;dr: Do I have any legal recourse I can take against this car dealership for their repair causing other damage?

I had been away from my hometown for awhile for an internship. I knew I would be gone for awhile, so I had extensive work done on my car earlier in 2021, but my car had not been worked on since besides doing a couple oil changes myself. A week ish before Christmas in 2021, I started the +2000 mile drive home. Since I departed from my hometown earlier in the year, I put 12,000 miles on the car. 

About a day into my drive, my car broke down resulting in a tow to a small town. The mechanic in down determined the repair needed to be done at a dealer so was towed there. The dealer determined it actually just needed a starter and had me on the road within 24 hours. Due to the many days of being broken down, this was now December 23rd. I had about 1700 miles left, so was going to be a long couple days to make it back for Christmas. This was important because just a few days prior, my grandfather had passed away, and my family was mourning his loss, so I was trying to get home ASAP. 

I made it about 300 miles and my car broke down, but entirely different symptoms than before. After waiting for hours for a tow truck, it was 10pm before I got off the highway. After calling in the morning, the dealer in the area would not look at it until after Christmas. The issue was odd and without the proper tools, there was no way I was diagnosing it myself. Not wanting to be stuck 1400 miles away from home, alone on Christmas, mourning my grandfather's death, I rented a UHaul truck to tow my car home and have it looked at back there. 

When my mechanic looked at it after Christmas, it was determined that there was a small piece of plastic that wedged the throttle body open which he said was no way it could've originated from inside the intake anywhere. Given there is a filter, it would've had to have happened when it was taken off for some reason. I reached out to the dealer that did the starter and learned that they removed the intake during the repair. The only other time that intake had been removed was nearly 12,000 miles ago by my mechanic. I know they wouldn't have intentionally placed plastic in my intake, but logically, it's not crazy to believe they were negligent and either had a part fly across the shop, or just weren't being careful with parts around them. I don't know where else it would've came from that wouldn't have been an issue for the 12,000 miles, but just became an issue in the last 300.

Between additional hotel costs, further car repairs, another tow bill and the UHaul, the breakdown that logically was caused by their negligence during the starter repair cost me $3000. Do I have any legal recourse against the dealer for them to cover the costs? And if so, is the argument the fact they had the intake off and my car broke down due to foreign object debris in the intake 300 miles later strong enough?"

Today I got an email for an Atlassian internship position (SRE) for 22/23 summer asking for a phone interview (apparently I passed the coding interview even though I only completed 3/5 ish questions). I took the test at least 3 months ago. 

I guess I’m a bit conflicted because on one hand, I have a great role currently which I enjoy, but I think the general consensus in this sub and the industry is that Atlassian is one of the top places to work for in Australia, and an internship is one way to get a foot in their doors. However, I’m also wary of wasting my time with their super long recruitment process, especially since I’m 90% sure there are at least 2 more rounds minimum, if not more. 

So what do you guys think? Should I give the Atlassian internship role a shot or should I just continue with my current role, which I do enjoy."

I am a Chinese citizen currently working as an Data Analyst intern in a China. I want to migrate to the Netherlands or Germany because I dislike the current sociopolitical situation and work environment here. I plan to start by study Data Science at a local university, then find a job in that country and obtain Permanent Residence.

I obtained Bachelor of Science degree from a US University in 2021 (4 years of staying the US, not remote) and has been admitted by Leiden University (MSc Statistics &amp; Data Science) in the Netherlands, and have already submitted my application to the English Data Science masters programs of multiple German universities.

I have to decide between going to Leiden University or one of the German universities, because the deadline for confirming the application is June 1st for non-EU citizens (for the processing of resident permits), and the offers of German universities are only arriving after that date.

(Theoretically, I can choose to delay the offer for Leiden to the next semester, but I'd rather not do so since I would like to leave the nation soon because of absurd lockdown regulations and my current job does not offer a lot of room for personal improvement.)

Some information about me or my school choices that would be important for making decisions-I am only fluent in Mandarin (Native) and English (C2). I have only 1 year of education each in German and Spanish (probably not even enough for A1), although I am willing to learn a new language.

\-I have never visited Europe before so most of my information are from the internet. I do have a friend from Germany who said Germany has good work-life balance, but he knows little about the Netherlands.

\-My parents want me to only study at universities with a high world ranking (Top 200) so my degree could be recognized *in the very unlikely event* that I have to work back in China again. I do not plan to work here anymore but I would have to at least agree to that as a possibility to be allowed to study abroad in the first place. Among all universities I applied only TUM and LMU Munich have higher rankings (and thus higher reputation for Chinese employers at least), but I doubt I would qualify since I barely scraped their EC requirements--I took some, but not a lot of probability statistics and programming classes during my undergraduate studies.

\-My city is under lockdown (I do not plan to specify which in case the CCP net police are monitoring my account), so visa processing may be an issue, especially for German where the university does not handle the processing on behalf of the students.

\-Dutch student visa does not come with a work permit, and it was said many employers simply deny recruiting non-EU students because they have to apply a permit for the student. Would this hinder my ability to network with an employer through internship? Because I need to guarantee that I get a job after I graduate so I can continue to stay and work towards enough time for permanent residence.

Thank you very much for helping!"

Am lucrat cu majoritatea tehnologiilor: php, wordpress, angular, react, node, python, mongodb.

Acum cateva saptamani am dat un interviu pentru un post de frontend dev la o companie mai mare, au fost cateva intrebari despre angular super ok. La partea practica era o problema basic (javascript) care trebuia rezolvata in timpul interviului cu screenshare, fara google etc.

Trebuia parcurs un array si folosite cateva functii de js, aveam deja tot planul in minte, nu era nimic complicat insa efectiv aveam brain fog, nu imi aminteam exact care erau functiile (niciodata nu le-am memorat cap coada), le incurcam intre ele, in panica mea am incercat sa folosesc inclusiv din PHP. Timpul s-a scurs si nu am reusit sa scriu mai nimic din ce aveam in minte. Evident ca dupa interviu, cu putin google, am rezolvat problema in cateva minute.

M-am demoralizat complet dupa ce am primit raspunsul, nu am mai aplicat la alte joburi desi primesc zilnic mesaje pe linkedin de la recrutori. Nu ma simt in stare sa trec de partea tehnica la un interviu nici macar de internship/ junior. Nu mai am motivatie sa continui cu programarea, inainte invatam si in timpul liber, faceam si freelancing pe proiecte mici, acum astept sa se faca ora 5 sa rup usa."

u8ruuf,1,2022-04-21,Choosing between the ideal research internship or the (almost ideal) non-research full-time job,mister_AV,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/u8ruuf/choosing_between_the_ideal_research_internship_or/,"Hey all!

I am about to graduate from my Master's degree and am super interested in applying for a PhD in the future. For the next couple of years, however, I am more interested in working in industry and recouping some of the costs of Master's degree (and I don't feel ready mentally to do 5 years of school). One thing that worries me is that, although I think I can get some great letters of rec and have a pretty tight rationale for grad school (I am currently writing a research proposal that I would love to turn into a PhD thesis at some point and have got endorsements from my current faculty members to pursue this), I am concerned about not having enough lab/research experience.   


I am currently in talks to do a research internship at a super renowned department for the summer. The work is ideal and directly related to what I want to study in the future. However, being an international student, the internship does end over summer and I am worried about going back to job applications right after.

Simultaneously, I have also received an offer to work in a super high growth startup with fantastic pay and most boxes ticked (they're willing to sponsor, the team seems amazing, they are fully remote). Most importantly, this option allows me to go live near my S/O, something that I have not been able to do for a very long time.

These are amazing choices, and I am really grateful that I even get to make such a decision, but I am still debating the next move. I am leaning towards the job, but I really want to validate a few things with people here:  


1. I am afraid that leaving the bubble of the university will make it more difficult to find research positions in my field later (I work in HCI/Media Studies/Communication). It's hard to say no to this internship when it would, in any other circumstance, be a dream path for me. How true have people found this?
2. At the same time, my instructors at my current university are trying to convince me that in my field (HCI/Media Studies/Communication), having a solid research topic, having ""life experience"" and good letters of rec all matter more than trying to add one more internship underneath one's belt. Can anyone weigh in on this?

I would love to hear your thoughts on this if you have any!   
Cheers"

One is my state university which I never thought I would legitimately consider until a few weeks ago, and an out of state university that gave me similar aid that has historically been a financial safety for many people in my school that chose to go there over better universities, so I would still know people there. Under any normal situation I wouldn't have much of a problem deciding between the two options and I would go to the out-of-state university just to get away from my hometown and live the ""college experience."" However, due to my concurrent enrollment in a bunch of classes at my local community college, I get my associates degree with my high school diploma, meaning that if I go to my state school I could graduate in 1-2 years with my bachelor's, but the out-of-state school barely takes any of my credits, meaning that I would have to go there for a minimum of 3 years in order to complete a bachelor's degree. To add fuel to the fire, the company that I will be interning for this summer has told me that if I choose to go to my state school they will offer me an internship throughout the school year which would pay my tuition and then some. Also, I don't necessarily think I would want to do grad school right out of undergrad because I've heard that it's best to go straight to the workforce after undergrad for Computer Science, but if I go to my state school I will 100% try to transfer to UIUC(In-State) my first year whatever my chances may be. 

Should I go to my state school and graduate quickly with my bachelor's within two years alongside an internship or spend a bit more time at an out-of-state university and experience the ""college experience."" Any advice would help right now because I am absolutely confused as to what to do."

I lost my very first shot getting into a female network club during freshman year because I missed the application deadline and now I'm paying for it. Every single possible women committee or clubs or network that I try to apply, ends up rejecting me and its soul-crushing right now.

I come from a small country with little to no prior experience in programming because my high school has no funds for that, work my way into getting a scholarship to study in the us, then being a TA for multiple classes, leading software teams, and i hv an upcoming internship this summer. I know I'm not the best candidate there but I know how tough it is to work through things alone so I want to be in a women's network. But apparently I'm not good enough for them.

I understand I don't have to seek people's approval to be decent at something. But it's just frustrating to see myself being rejected by a group of people who are supposed to understand these rejections by society."

I've almost finished first year at university studying Computer Science. The question is, what should I do over the summer?

I did Java in both semesters (OOP in the second one), HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript and PHP. 

What should I do over the summer that can go well with these? I've only got one project in Java so I will for sure spend some time making another project/improving the current one as I really loved working on the last one (although it was time pressured because it was for my module), but what should I learn alongside what I know? I was thinking about React but not really have a reason as to why React.

Around a year ago I had set out on the goal to get into Google CSSI, which got derailed now because of family vacation plans that prevent me from staying in the country, which is required by the program.

I've pretty much been working with python on and off for around 2+ years by now and I'd consider myself at least an intermediate in that language.

It has been 2 months, over 70 applications, and just 2 follow-ups with the drop after the first interview screening. 

Ideally, I am trying to get into IT project management (with no IT experience). From what I understand, I need to get into IT Marketing \\ Marketing project management first. What skills do I need to acquire for my resume to become noticed? Any advice on how to up my resume? What would you consider the most important things to highlight?  
It gets more complicated because my partner is in the military, and I can only consider remote jobs.    
Any feedback on my resume will be greatly appreciated.

u8xf01,4,2022-04-21,[Canada] Fruitless Job Hunt even with 2 years of full time experience in mid-office and a Masters Degree; would appreciate any resume critique and time you can provide,YippyKaiYay999,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/u8xf01/canada_fruitless_job_hunt_even_with_2_years_of/,"[Resume](https://imgur.com/a/G90gsmC)

Finished undergrad in '19 and went straight to a master's for the top rated non MBA Finance Master's in Canada at Rotman. (MFRM)

Was very fortunate to basically get a return offer from the internship I got during the program and started during the worst time for job hunting in spring of 2020. Only 4-6 classmates out of 60 had jobs at graduation due to cancelled offers thanks to early covid.

Would have been making 90-100k pre bonus based on historical class stats but due to covid I counted my blessings and accepted a role paying 70-80k with a 10k bonus.

I wanted to get into FO trading but again due to the early pandemic situation had to pick my battles. Don't see myself staying in Treasury or mid office and I've been trying to apply for jobs and at first would target for front office roles or mid office but now I even blanket apply to even back office and I have gotten zero interviews even after 300+ applications. Started hunting in the fall as it was the 1.5 year mark of my role right now and I don't want to get silo'd by staying past 2 years as I'm already 25 and sometimes feel behind. 

I've had 3 interviews for positions friends referred me to at their companies/teams and their managers all loved me and even tried going to bat for my requested salary expectation but HR would shut it down and I wasn't willing to leave my current role for the same pay or only 10% more given that right now people can get 30-50% pay raises by changing jobs. This leads me to believe that something is wrong with my resume as when I've had insiders put me in the interview chair they've all told me their managers thought I was the best candidate by a mile.

Would really appreciate any advice as I'm really starting to get demotivated and it's starting to affect my state of mind and self-esteem as I continually hear of friends or LinkedIn job updates from connections that seem to be huge jumps meanwhile I can't even get to the interview stage.

Thank you kindly

u8ydzg,1,2022-04-21,"Is anyone here considering getting out of their career in dev not because they hate coding, but because the pandemic has pretty much destroyed the social aspect of the dev career?",techsavvynerd91,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u8ydzg/is_anyone_here_considering_getting_out_of_their/,"A little background about me: I am a student on a 16 month internship that started in May 2021 and ends in August 2022. I work as a Software Developer and this is my first ever dev job. So far the entire internship has been virtual and will probably be until the end.

Yesterday, I went to visit my office for the very first time and wow it was depressing. At the company I work for, going in-person is not mandatory. It's optional and I decided to go to experience a change of scenery and try to get some of that ""in-person"" experience I've always wanted. I remember back in 2015 and 2016 when I used to watch Google's and Microsoft career videos on YouTube where head office would show what a day in the life of a developer would look like at one of these companies. It looked really great and fun!

Now in my area of the office where my team would work before the pandemic, there were like 40 cubicles and I was the only one there. No one else from my team, no one else from the department. We've had the in-person option since the beginning of March and I think only one other guy from my team of 15 has actually gone to the office, so he's probably experienced the same thing as I did today.

This shit felt no different than being at home. The whole ""change of scenery"" only feels nice for like at most the first hour of the day, then after that you're just sitting there like ""wtf am I doing here?"" It's literally the same routine. Wake up, open my laptop, do some work, go to my daily scrum meeting that's 15 minutes long where I speak for like 2 minutes, do some work again, lunch, work, log off. Repeat next day unless it's the weekend. The only difference was yesterday I had to wake up early and drive 20 minutes before opening my laptop. I know, 20 minutes is not a long drive. That's not my problem/complaint. My problem is as someone who is extroverted, loves to socialize and meet new people, I didn't get that kind of human interaction/social environment at all. The thing about being a Software Developer is as long as you have a laptop and an internet connection, you can literally do the job anywhere. And the ability to do the job anywhere is why head office won't force anyone to go in-person. There's like no logical reason that makes sense to force a developer to work in a specific environment.

When I went for lunch, I sat in this big ass cafeteria alone. My company has employed 3000+ people and somehow I'm alone. I'm looking outside and thinking ""Is this it? Is this my life for the next 40+ years and then I die? All alone already at the age of 22?""

Before you say, ""Well you should try doing virtual stuff with your co-workers to make your day more fun!"" No. Virtual human interactions are nowhere near the same or even as fun as in-person human interactions. I don't get why some people have trouble comprehending this. I can remember some in-person memory I did like 10+ years ago and easily recall the conversations and emotions that I went through, yet I will completely forget some kind of virtual shit I did the day before. Yes, some virtual activities can be fun but the bonding experience just didn't feel the same if it were in-person.

I know some people are reading this and are completely against everything I'm saying and I'm totally fine if you hate what I'm saying. Maybe it's because I don't have children? Maybe it's because I'm not old and my health is deteriorating? Maybe it's because I don't have to commute 40+ minutes? Maybe it's because I'm an intern and this is my first job in my field? I don't know, everyone has their reasons for virtual and in-person. The preference of either one is extremely subjective.

Before this job, I worked in retail (pre-pandemic). I was making minimum wage (I live in Canada), I had no paid holidays, and my duties were tedious and boring at times, but weren't too bad. It was a tiring job as you know I had to do a lot of physical shit. My internship on the other hand, I make double what I used to make an hourly in retail, I do get paid holidays, no benefits or paid sick time (just like retail) but you know it's because I'm an intern, I love my coding duties way more than my retail duties, and I don't get physically tired since I just sit on my ass all day. But the one thing that makes retail far better for me is the social aspect of it. The simple ""Hi! How are you?"" from coworkers goes a long way. Most people act like that shit does mean anything, but trust me, after two years of being locked inside saying ""Hi"" can mean a lot. And it isn't just that. Conversations with my co-workers about life in general, cracking jokes with one another, even small talk with some of our best customers, that kind of stuff always made my day better and made the job less sufferable. I want those types of conversations/interactions at the office. I want to see my co-workers and be like ""Hey! How's it going? Heard you went to the cottage over the weekend, how was that?"" Shit like that is how you bond and begin to develop a relationship with the people you work with. People don't wanna just think and talk about ""work"" related shit all the time, no matter how passionate they are about their job. There's more to life than work and people want to talk about the other stuff. And I know I'm not the only one who feels like this.

The point I'm trying to get across is this: I fucking hate virtual. I fucking hate sitting on my laptop 5 days a week from 9-5 in one spot not being social at all in that time period. Dead silent because who else is there to talk to other than me? I need something more consistent. I need the social life I had in retail with my co-workers 5 days a week from 9-5. Not a ""let's get together!"" team bonding exercise once every quarter. So yeah, I can deal with this right now because I'm an intern and I have to go back to university to finish my final year of university, but once I graduate, work will be...well my life and I don't think this is the life that I want to live. The pandemic has most likely made it impossible for companies to force developers to go back to the work lifestyle they had pre-pandemic after working 2+ years at home showing that virtual works and there's no need to go in-person."
u8ypfx,0,2022-04-21,Would you start your first job out of college fully remote?,MeatMechanic321,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/u8ypfx/would_you_start_your_first_job_out_of_college/,"I graduated from university last May 2021 with my degree in electrical engineering. I received two offers from MEP firms, which is the industry I would like to be in. 

One firm is in a relatively large city, and the firm has been nothing but forthcoming about growth, opportunity, and their support system for new engineers. Sounds promising. 

The other firm (about 1/5 the size as the other firm) is here in town where I live, and the position is 100% remote. Now this firm sounds helpful in terms of growth and learning as well, but all interactions will be on Microsoft Teams. I’m a little weary of this as I’m new and inexperienced, and I’ve had internships (Not in MEP) that were remote and they were unfulfilling and frustrating to say the least. I wouldn’t want to step on any toes or aggravate people with project questions, design questions, etc, over Teams. 

What do y’all think? 

Thanks so much!"

Recently I got a mobile app dev internship offer from Hawaiian Airlines for $25/hr with a free intern trip to Hawaii included.
The problem is, I've already accepted an offer from a company called DriveTime as a database developer intern for the exact same pay ($25/hr). DriveTime offered me a possibility to hire me as a remote part time worker after my internship (depending on their resources, needs, and my performance during the internship). 

The reason why I accepted the DriveTime offer is because they responded super fast a few months ago, while Hawaiian just responded in the last few days. 
(Note: I applied to both at the exact same time). 
I didn't expect an offer from Hawaiian so I didn't expect this to happen:(

I can't decide if trying to afford Berkeley is worth it in the long run.

Berkeley EECS

Pros

* Prestigious program
* 1 for CS(tied with the other big four)
* Nice Weather
* Priority to classes in CS
* If I want to double major, pretty much all the majors there are highly ranked
* More people end up at the FAANG

Cons

* OOS tuition
* Cost of Attendance: 65k (tuition, room, board, personal expenses) 
* Overcrowded
* A little bit unsafe area

Colby College Pros

* Full ride with a part-time job
* LAC - &gt; More attention
* Less people
* It's building an AI Lab
* Presidential Scholar

Cons

* Not known for CS
* More difficult to land at FAANG
* It's isolated
* Bad weather
* A lot of athletes

My family can help me pay the first year at Berkeley and also a portion of the other years. I will be taking internships over the summers and working on campus. There is also a loan program for internationals at Cal with low interest rate that can cover another portion.

I've also applied to 4 external scholarships that can help me pay for the full tuition or part of it.

I make $15,500 per year and work from 1:00pm-6:00pm. Today I was offered a job at the county courthouse. This new salary would be $29,000, include benefits, and the hours are 8:30am-4:30pm. I get holidays and weekends off. My lunch would be an unpaid hour. I am also enrolled in a paralegal program and my classes are at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my current job. I get to stare at my phone for five hours a day and the work isn't super intense. My boss is super supportive and friendly. I enjoy interacting with the students and my coworkers. With this job, I get to stay up late since my shift doesn’t start till 1:00pm and the upper management for my department often brings in snacks or candy. This job allows me to keep in touch with friends and my boyfriend who lives on the west coast. 

&amp;#x200B;

The new job fits my school schedule more, is full time, and comes with benefits. However, it is a non-union position and I have yet to receieve any emails about it as the offer was made this afternoon. I don't have anything in writing either. This new job would give me a foot in the door for a career in the legal field. It also fulfills my internship requirement for my paralegal program.  

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I have accepted the offer I am very nervous. I feel like I am making a big mistake. I have only been working at the community college for three months; I just had my post nintey day evaluation and passed with flying colors. I expressed my interest to become a full-time employee and my boss let me use her as a reference for a full-time opening within our department. However, the posting keeps closing and opening. I feel guilty about leaving and I don't want to burn any bridges with the community college or my boss. I only applied to this new job because the dean for my paralegal program sent out job postings to students in the program in order for us to gain experience with interviews.

I'm a freshman CS Major and I'm trying to get a good job to make use of the opportunity I have, and I already feel like I'm doing it wrong. I don't think I'm qualified to be in the college I'm in, and I'm probably not. Everyone is more attractive than me; I can barely even stand being out in public. Going on Instagram and TikTok and going out in public and seeing people much more attractive than me genuinely makes me want to cry. I've barely been talking to people and I don't have close friends like other people do. My room selection lottery number is probably going to force me to be in a double room in a shitty dorm. Everyone around me has accomplished more than me - compared to them, I'm completely useless. Going to the gym with almost everyone in better shape/more attractive than me reminds me of that. Exercise genuinely does not benefit me in any way - I feel the same and look the same as I did before, except worse. My parents are supporting me through college, which I cannot be more grateful for, and I acknowledge how much privilege I have for them to even give my enrollment in college a thought. Right about now, you probably think I'm a spoiled loser, and you are entitled to think that way – I have no redeeming qualities. If I don't make enough money when I graduate, I feel like I would end up wasting their time and energy on me. I really don't think I'll ever be good enough.

Sorry for venting,

I feel dumb making these mistakes. I'm told that I need to be more independent, but when I think things through and make choices, I'm told I made the worst possible choice ever. And people get tired of me asking for advice. I thought about every possible outcome (including damage control), but I end up failing in the process, and regret everything in the end. It really feels bad when someone tells you to ""think things through"" with ""logic and common sense"". The lectures are really triggering, and I ruminate over them for days, and sometimes they pop out of nowhere. That's the one of the only things I can easily commit to memory and attention. Here are some of the worst things they say:

* ""Remember when we talked about \[X\]? You should have paid more attention and took notes. 
* ""You should have more aware of the people and things around you.""
* ""Tell me exactly what I said.""
* ""We've been through this over, and over, and over again. Honestly, I'm getting irritated. I don't know what else to tell or do with you. It seems it goes into one ear and out of the other.""
* ""Why don't you use logic and common sense? It's NOT THAT HARD. You're a grown adult. You should know better.""
* ""You should have waited and thought this through. Why didn't you ask me for help?""
* ""I can't hold your hand forever. You need to take the initiative and roll with the punches. Make good choices."" 
* ""No, I don't think I can trust you with that. I don't want to risk it. You're not ready.""
* ""You messed up big time. now I have to fix this later. Nope, don't say anything. **I'll do it myself**. Get out.""
   * **THIS IS THE WORST ONE.** I hate it when I screw up, and someone has to fix the mess I made, probably out of their own time while they're doing something important. I freeze up in the moment and have to take every second of their lecture (especially if they're complaining about me out loud in the open). I just stand there and take it like a punching bag out. I get scared if I don't. I feel that I'm a little kid getting sentenced to a penitentiary. 

It's like those interactive cutscenes in video games where you either make the right or wrong decision, and you have no idea what's in store in the future, like Until Dawn. 

I'm trying to control my sporadic behavior. When I have a problem, I feel that I need to solve it ASAP (aka, right NOW, before the point of no return). Especially if I'm asked to make a decision right at that moment. And I feel that no matter what I do, it's going to be wrong. It's a no-win situation.

For example: We have really old sponges and scrubs (a Scrub Daddy, and two soft scrubs) that were the point of breaking, and so I threw them away and replaced them with new ones. My mom yelled that those scrubs were special (which I didn't know), and you couldn't get them anymore (although she asked her friend for more).

Another one would be my job. I taught an elective class, and I told the person in charge (which they told me to talk to if I had problems) that the kids hit each other. And then, my boss said that this might damage the relationship between us and the school, so they let me go of my internship without warning. Apparently, I didn't respect the ""chain of commands,"" even though it's not the first time we did it. Thankfully, my college supervisors agree I did the right thing (and they're going to file a report, so ***fuck*** them) and I have my hours, so I'm good. But I still mull over it. I'm scared that I'll be at a job and screw up again and again.

I feel that I've always had a problem with decision-making, problem-solving, and common sense. I've been told that I need to go through with interacting with others and experiencing life, but I'm tired of pretty words and being sweared at. I'm tired of having to explain myself, over-apologizing, and taking blame (even for stuff I didn't even do, but I have to take responsibility because SOMEONE has to). 

It sucks."

u93dxk,179,2022-04-21,"For any junior DevOps folks out there, get comfortable with being absolutely clueless :)",supasopa,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/u93dxk/for_any_junior_devops_folks_out_there_get/,"So I started a DevOps internship with a  cybersecurity firm roughly 5 months ago. My internship is gonna be over pretty shortly and I got the confirmation that they're going to be hiring me on full time. I've been lurking on this subreddit since the beginning of my internship constantly searching the key words ""stress"" &amp; ""too much to learn"" in the search header lol.

I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. DevOps is definitely not a role someone can just transition to in the course of several months. There's so much knowledge and expertise across different domains needed just to be able to do your job decently. On top of that, I had pretty much little to no prior experience doing development work. I did setup a couple servers on IBM cloud and did some small automation stuff to download anime torrents but that was about it.

My internship was extremely stressful. I spent a bunch of time outside of work and on the weekends just to stay afloat. I always constantly felt behind and my manager had very high expectations of me. I went from not knowing how to make a simple GET request to building out an API that connects connecting multiple pipelines and cloud services. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting very miniscule stuff like my script wasn't working because I wasn't in the right directory etc. I didn't get much help from my co-workers because they were always extremely busy so I got a ton of help from a lot of people online and bombarding stackoverflow. 

I still feel extremely overwhelmed with my workload , but I've gotten a lot more comfortable with the process of learning how to find the right answers and asking the right questions. I'm really happy with how far I've came and for individuals out there who are seeking an entry level role in DevOps, I would highly recommend you to read the Phoenix project, study the architecture behind a couple tools like kube/aws code pipeline, get your hands dirty by doing some hands on stuff and know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. 

Coming from poverty, getting a full time job doing something that I find really cool and pays well is pretty bonkers to me. Now I just want to wrap up my comp sci degree, continue to learn as much as I can and spend my weekends doing some leisure activities. 

Here's a brief itinerary of my internship experience.

1st Month:

\- Read and update documentation

\- Build some basic pipelines

2nd Month:

\- Shadow with another engineer on building an automated solution

\- Got into some trouble for just shadowing and not contributing to engineers work

3rd Month:

\- Build an automation solution for a niche use case

\- Destroy the automated solution because it's no longer needed

4th Month:

\- Work on building the automated solution again because business needs have changed and create an API for this automated solution for organization to use

5th Month:

\- Configure this API to connect with multiple cloud services. Interview with different stakeholder on different use cases for this automated solution 

\- Bathe in glory

\- Go back to gym cuz I gained a crap ton of weight lol"
u93ol9,133,2022-04-21,Can I avoid having a tenant when I have a guest for a long period?,InteractionNo7059,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/u93ol9/can_i_avoid_having_a_tenant_when_i_have_a_guest/,"We’re in California. 

A distant cousin will be in my city for 10 weeks for a summer internship. She’s in law school and will be working for the local DA. When she applied for the internship she had expected to say stay with her step brother, but he’s now moving to Texas two weeks before her internship is set to begin. She reached out and asked if she could stay with us for the 10 weeks. 

Although we’re not close (we only ran into each other at family events once every year or two) I remember being in school and I did well in life because I was supported by family, and given things like a place to stay during internships from my parents. I feel bad that her parents aren’t able or willing to help in those ways, so I said sure.  We haven’t discussed and I wasn’t planning to ask for rent or to have a written agreement. We have a guest bedroom for her to use.

My hesitation is that, we have young children, and we’re very different from my cousin. She is (was?) a born-again Christian type. She’s very pro-Trump, anti-Feminist, pro-Life, etc. We’re not any of those things. I suspect (and hope) nothing comes up, but I’m worried that if I become uncomfortable with her in the house, I won’t be able to just make her leave - that she’ll have rights as a tenant rather than a guest. If she started telling my kids to love Jesus (knowing we’re Jews) it would be a huge problem for me.

Can someone help me understand what my rights in this context would be? Anything we can do in advance to give us better leverage to get her out?"

I have just accepted a tech support summer internship upon completion of my CS degree in May. I just got reached out for an interview for a mid technical analyst role. I don’t know if this role will align with my career path. My initial thought was to jump from tech support - system admin - network engineer - cybersecurity. Is this a reasonable career path to get into cybersecurity? If not, please advice. Below is the job description of the technical analyst. Does it make sense to get into it? Thank you all in advance!!

I am an undergrad CS + STAT student that really enjoys algorithms, math, statistics, and theory overall. Given my interest, I am convinced that graduate school (Ph.D) into industry research positions may be a good path. However, I don't want to make a rash decision without knowing what is out there. There is a obviously a bias in the career paths I know as an undergrad. Does anyone know of tech/SWE roles that regularly incorporate mathematical thinking? I would like to target my applications towards those types of internship for next summer as a rising junior. I would particularly like to hear from anyone who enjoyed/studied MATH/STAT/related-fields as an undergrad.

For context, I don't really enjoy data munging, so a lot of aspects of data science (mostly the cleaning part) is starting to bore me a bit. I enjoyed discrete math, algorithms I &amp; II, proof-based linear algebra, and various statistics courses I have taken thus far. Looking at Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, or Probability Theory next fall. I also have software development experience using React JS with a student organization for the past year. 

As for prior experience, I was able to secure Amazon SDE offer and AI Research REU at a Top-5 CS university for this summer. So, I would be open to study hard for positions that are interesting and competitive. I am taking the REU, hence directing the attention to industry next summer to have an experience both for academia and industry."

Ever since second week I've been extremely overwhelmed with work and because I'm such an overachiever and of course I don't know when to say no. Just when something big finishes I have no time to breathe, it's exhausting. I literally have been sick three times in the last month, missed a menstrual cycle, and lost my voice,  it's been that stressful.

Anyways I guess my post is just to figure out how you all do it, after a new job and starting out after graduation, how do you balance life and work. I find myself struggling a bit and trying to find my footing, but I am so overwhelmed...it is freaking hard. I guess it is busy season for me (as my company is non-profit and we rely on donor relations for funds) so maybe it'll calm down soon since Summer is coming?? 

But anyways I am in communications and I get so many people coming to me with stuff they need help in last second and as a new person it's hard to say I really am swamped and can't do it when my superior is in the meeting. (She definitely appreciates me and recognizes my hard work, but as a newbie I can't help feel like there are expectations for me to uphold) *****literally I had come down with the flu, felt horrible and worked 16 hrs in one day at my worst because there were deadlines, and I'm not getting paid for those extra hrs bc I'm salary.

Ugghhh, can someone lend some advice, give me some words of wisdom, help me not feel like a bad person for drawing a line so my time at work doesn't encroach on my personal time??? I'm gonna be honest, I do not live to work, I don't want my job to consume my life because I am more than just my career, I am a human being that requires human activity to function!! I see coworkers with children and sit and ask myself how tf they do it?!?! Like how the hell am I going to do it one day of I can barely stay healthy enough to take care of myself(considering my track record so far)!!!


And just to clarify, I am not trying to complain I am grateful for having a job and having a steady income, I just feel like for the work I am doing and how much I am being compensated don't quite match. I just want to know how to manage, and how I can draw that line! Help me say no!!"

I can't decide if trying to afford Berkeley is worth it in the long run.

Berkeley EECS

Pros

* Prestigious program
* 1 for CS(tied with the other big four)
* Nice Weather
* Priority to classes in CS
* If I want to double major, pretty much all the majors there are highly ranked
* More people end up at the FAANG

Cons

* OOS tuition
* Cost of Attendance: 65k (tuition, room, board, personal expenses) 
* Overcrowded
* A little bit unsafe area

Colby College Pros

* Full ride with a part-time job
* LAC - &gt; More attention
* Less people
* It's building an AI Lab
* Presidential Scholar

Cons

* Not known for CS
* More difficult to land at FAANG
* It's isolated
* Bad weather
* A lot of athletes

My family can help me pay the first year at Berkeley and also a portion of the other years. I will be taking internships over the summers and working on campus. There is also a loan program for internationals at Cal with low interest rate that can cover another portion.

I've also applied to 4 external scholarships that can help me pay for the full tuition or part of it.

So, basically, i'm looking for advice on subjects/programming languages/online courses/or other topic to learn this summer. 


We learned the principles of OOP in Java on our classes, so I thought already of doing something like Web Development (TOP or CS50web) or even getting an intensive course in English to get a Cambridge Certification (might be useful in this field of work).

What are your suggestions of stuff to learn in summer? Something related to my field or something entirely different?

I basically applied ""by mistake"", I was sending applications for Summer Internships, and judging by the name of the position and a rather vague job description I thought I was indeed applying for an intern position.

Then interviews began and the Interviewer told me it's a full-time position. The Company relies heavily on the Quant Analytics team, the Analytics Lead is basically on the same level of the CTO, but they keep the team relatively small on purpose to have faster decision making, they want to be kind of like a ""racing team"".

I explained my ""mistake"", but they decided to advance me to the next round anyway. Round after round I kept explaining that I wouldn't stay long term, to be as honest as possible, and yet they kept advancing me. 
In the end I got the job, starting next June, with some sort of ""informal"" agreement that I would be able to resign after 3 months if I wanted to, or continue if I decided not to pursue further studies, entirely up to me. Keep in mind that I'm sure I will continue my studies, and I will be moving to another country for my Master's.

At first I was ecstatic: I really like the company, the position is great and it sounds much more ""interesting"" than the usual undergrad internship, a perfect learning experience. However I finished the interviews in October, and since then I've seen a few new hires for the same Quant Analyst position I was hired for.

The Quant Analytics Team now is roughly 15~20 people, just about the size they told me back in October, but almost all the new hires for my position are Maths PhDs or Post-Docs, many of them from high ranking Universities, most of them with previous relevant experience, I'm an undergrad at my first real work experience.
Now that June is right around the corner I've been wondering: what do I bring to the table? How can I really be useful compared to my ""peers""? Gosh why did they even hire me?

Have you ever felt so ""underqualified"" compared to your colleagues? If so, how did things go from there? What did you do? Any suggestions on how to make myself ""useful""?"

**Letters of Recommendation - weren't even accepted for the most successful stretch of my college list lol**

**Pre-Calc Honors Teacher:  8-9/10 ish.** Was in their first period during their first year of teaching. Maybe that counts for something. They also were the staff member that served as an advisor for one of my med clubs. Probably a solid letter.

**APLAC Teacher:** **9-10/10.** Got along really well with them, and they were very enthusiastic to write my letter.

**T20 Med School Prof:** **10/10.** Ok here's the catch. They basically let me write an initial draft because they were busy (testament towards our relationship ig). So yea . . . that was a fire letter. Though given my results for any non-UC schools, which were the only ones where his letter went, idk why this letter didn't make that big of an impact.

**Pediatrician I shadowed with: 7-8/10.** Had a good time working for them, especially given that I was doing important logistical work for them even during lockdown. However, the letter was definitely generic and based on past ones they've written. They also got somewhat upset at me for my follow-ups over winter break requesting them to upload the letter to Common App, but that's a story for another time. Decent-ish LOR probably lol. Though, given my results for outside the UC system, it probably didn't make a big impact. 

**Interviews - didn't get a lot, and they were pretty straightforward**

**UMich:** Great. Super friendly interviewer working in the Biotech industry. The conversation was lengthy and honestly quite fun.

**Rochester:** Pretty chill. Involved the interviewer spending a good amount of time answering my questions about pre-med and the research environment at Rochester.

**Case Western:** Pretty much same quality as the UMich one, except the interviewer was a current pre-med student so the conversation took a turn in that direction instead of BME.

**Essays**

**Common App:** Honestly pretty good imo. Wrote a genuine explanation about how being the child of H-1B parents (skill-based visa for context) involved a great deal of fear and identity crisis from 3rd - 8th grade. Learned to channel that uncertainty about our visa status (given the sporadic nature of visa denial in the H1 program) into motivation and a work ethic. Idk the essay could've come off as soppy, but I put a good amount of time and effort into it.

**UC Essays** were based mainly on anecdotes from clubs, orgs, other work-related ec's, and how those shaped my character/provided opportunities for problem-solving. Similar pattern for supplementals.

**Additional Information (very long I know, my weird ""intl"" status as an applicant is covered here)**

I**nternational status:**

As mentioned in my Common App topic, I'm technically an H4 visa holder (dependent of H1-B visa holders). That complicated things quite a bit. Despite living in the states for a decade,  I was an *international applicant for admissions purposes* (even for UCs even though we are California residents) for pretty much all these schools. My dumbass also said ""yes"" to the requesting financial aid question on Common App for some of the privates, not knowing what it means, though I followed up with those schools and confirmed that me filling out no financial aid paperwork would mean I'm not an applicant with the ""requesting aid"" label. In the context of tuition for UCs, **I've looked a LOT into this. Filled out an SLR and thankfully UC Berkeley (and pretty sure every other UC) follows a separate set of rules for** ***residency for tuition purposes (separate from the admissions rules).*** I should qualify for in-state tuition, but that's actually a TBD in the next few weeks depending on the results of my SLR. Wish me luck :)

**SLU mEdiCaL SchOlarS proGram, thoughts pre-Berkeley, etc:**

OK so let's talk about this SLU Medical Scholars program. In my quest for BSMDs that accepted ""international"" applicants, I came across this program. After getting accepted, I was hyped because the stats online from different sites showed that it's pretty much just as competitive as any BSMD (which equated to the program's legitimacy in my mind at that time). **Here's the catch (and something future BSMD applicants should note): unlike a typical BSMD, meeting the academic requirements while in the Medical Scholars program (only GPA for SLU, other BSMDs require some level MCAT too) does NOT guarantee admissions to the SLU medical school. It only offers the opportunity to APPLY to the medical school during your sophomore year (no stats can be found regarding SLU med school acceptance rate through this path).**  This REALLY caught me off guard (and truthfully pissed me off), because from what I can tell this really isn't the norm in BSMDs. **It also was never specified on the SLU informational pages that I read** during the application process. So yea, just some food for thought. As for my overall results, I'd say I'm satisfied. The total wash from the east coast was a bit of a surprise since I imagined I'd land one big-time private. However, given geography and my school being more so a UC feeder, I'm not beating myself up over it. I've heard a lot of not-so-good things about how Berkeley's College of Engineering doesn't really mesh with a pre-med's aspiration for a high GPA. I am quite set on medical school as Plan A, so I guess I'll have to work my way through those challenges at Cal. I do find some comfort in the fact that Cal's percentage of pre-meds who get into med school is decently high for a large public school (56% ish). Prestige isn't everything, but nevertheless, I can't complain about landing a brand name like Cal. Feeling grateful and excited :)"

Currently I'm in first year of CS Master degree, next year I will pursue my studies with a specialization in cybersecurity (for the second year of Master).

So my question is as follows:

**For an apprenticeship or an internship, which questions can be asked to me during an interview?** I've an interview with a CISO on monday for an internship. Therefore, **what will be the technical and non-technical questions which he will ask to me?**

I'm an infosec enthusiast, I've already resolved some challenges on THM, HTB or Root-Me for example, I follow the news of this area on social medias, dedicated blogs, podcasts etc. so I already have some cybersecurity basics.

I'm looking for some job advice and figured I might turn to this sub. For background: I'm an international student (from the US originally) studying for an [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). in software development at QUB. This is a one-year programme that wraps up in September. As a student, I am able to apply for a two-year post-study work visa, which would enable me to work anywhere in the UK. At the moment, I am facing a dilemma, because I can't decide which route I should take. My ideas are: 

1. Apply for the visa and get a job in Belfast or maybe over in England. I have had a casual offer from a company here working as a Salesforce developer, and the work looks sort of interesting, although I know that taking this role might pigeonhole me a bit. Also, I am not thrilled with the idea of paying around 2000 pounds for the two-year visa and then having to continue forking over money to the Home Office each time I apply for a new visa. 

2. Move home for a few months after my programme and apply for a one-year working holiday visa in Ireland. This visa would allow me to work down south for a least a year. This idea appeals to me a lot, even if it brings more uncertainty to the situation since I am not guaranteed a job. But it would give me the chance to go home for a few months and hopefully secure an internship as I wait on the visa to come through. Also, my boyfriend lives in Dublin, so this would enable me to be closer to him as well. 

My long term goals are to move and live in Ireland/the EU. I'd also (not immediately, but eventually) like to secure a remote position where I could WFH. If anyone has any advice or ideas, I'd love to hear them. Reading this sub has been an eye-opening experience for me... super helpful as I try to switch careers. 

TIA!"
u9hfm6,2,2022-04-22,For anyone who’ve worked jobs they were not necessarily qualified for…,adroberts91,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/u9hfm6/for_anyone_whove_worked_jobs_they_were_not/,"Have you ever started a new job or been in a position professionally, where you had to learn on the job because during previous years of experience, you did in fact faked it till you made it?

How did you learn the skills necessary for the job you were/are on when we were getting in your own way and learning those skills seemed impossible? 

I just started a new job where the position itself is something I’m familiar with, but there are some basics that I should have known over the course of my previous years in my industry, but with the way that I’ve worked and the way that I am working in this current job, I am having to retrace my steps and I’m doing or we doing much of my work, the slowing down other people in my department and other departments that depend on us.

During the free interview process, which before that I was contacted by headhunter who definitely blew my skills out of the portion and was trying to make me look better than I probably am on paper, I did not lie or say anything false during interview, I think they were just assumptions made on both sides that now has me knee-deep in position I don’t feel qualified for.

I think I know what I’m supposed to learn and what I’m supposed to do, but every time I actually try to sit down even for a few minutes and learn the necessary things I’m supposed to know, it seems like an impossible thing that I can’t seem to absorb and I’m struggling to translate a few things I do absorb to my work in an appropriate amount of time so that everything continues to move forward smoothly.

Typically I will either stay late or stop clocking hours while I’m still at my desk just trying to fix my errors so that no one else has to suffer for the delayed in their deadlines.

Technically I’m in a senior position now, but there’s stuff that I should have known from my previous years in this industry, but I am almost completely self Todd minus an internship and wearing on the job in the past. 

I do ask for help when I can, but I also have this tendency to just sit and stew in my own confusion and frustration and eventually because I lose track of time while I’m stressed and anxious and stuck in some thing that too much time has passed and I can’t gather up there “professionalism” to ask for help or to admit that I don’t know what I’m doing.

Now I, as well as probably a bunch of you have a tendency to overthink things and worry about stuff that isn’t always the case or is worse in my head than it actually is. But for as much as I try to push myself and learn stuff, there seems to be some kind of invisible wall between my ability to learn absorbed things and actually caring said things out.

Has anyone else been in a situation similar to this or am I just dumber than I actually think I am?"

I am 20 yrs now. I managed to find an internship in my first year in a SE role and I have been working since then with the same company (working student). The company isn't small tho and it is considered the best in the category of physical products they manufacture.

I have also worked on a lot of personal projects in different areas (mobile dev, ml/ai, web) and got into a couple of hackathons and used languages I am not comfortable with to create cool apps.

I want to take it to the next level personally and apply for any of the FANG companies. My issue is that I don't know if I am ready for these companies or not. I want to give it a shot because I always have a feeling that I am better than most of the people in my circle (students studying with me, people I have worked with, even sometimes better than full time SE in the company I am in atm). I am aware that this might be completely wrong and does not give any indication about how good I am to fit into these companies,  that's why I need help/advice here. How can one know if he/she is capable of joining a big tech company or that he/she has all the skills they require."
u9jm7o,24,2022-04-22,Should I prepare for coding interviews for internships or learn web development?,bhenchod420,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/u9jm7o/should_i_prepare_for_coding_interviews_for/,"So, I am going to complete my bachelor's in computer science degree in May. I am coming to the US for my master's degree in computer science this fall.

Since we have to apply for internships in October or November, I am in a dilemma now.

I suck at coding interviews. I am weak in DSA. I know only arrays, hashing, stack and a little bit of binary search. On the other hand, I only know Python and made 7 projects using Python.

So, here is my question.

Should I start preparing for coding interviews right now? I will have at least 5 months of preparation time. I suck and it will take me some time to prepare.

Or, should I start learning web dev and make projects to showcase during interviews? I hate web dev but have some experience in it.

Also, if you have any good resources or roadmaps or advice on preparing for coding interviews, please share.

Thanks in advance!"
u9kbrl,82,2022-04-22,My networking advice with my personal cold email templates,stankyboi3000,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/u9kbrl/my_networking_advice_with_my_personal_cold_email/,"Hello everyone, I wanted to make a post discussing my experience with networking and what I have done as I have been reached out to by a few different individuals regarding my templates. A little background about me – I am currently in my first year at university at a big state school studying Finance. I personally am pursuing a career in the Commercial Real Estate Industry. I found that cold emails have the best response rate compared to LinkedIn messaging. I will try and break down everything I do the best I can into different parts.

I am still learning and critiquing my methods, but this is how I personally am networking currently and wanted to share as I have received lots of messages regarding it. I am also relatively new to networking so please critique and give advice regarding networking.

**Email Subject Line-**

What you subject the email is the most important aspect of cold emails as it is what intrigues the receiver of the email to take the time to open and read your email. I always try to customize each subject with something that is specific to them. My general subject like is “Interested in learning from your success in (industry or specific job)”.

**Email 1-**

Below is the template that I use as the foundation for all my cold emails. This is the email that I personally use so you can 100% craft your own. The bolded sentence in the cold email you ideally switch with “**I came across your LinkedIn profile as we have a few mutual connections.**” whenever you have mutual connections. This will intrigue them to either look you up to see who your mutual connections are but will also make them more inclined to speak with you as you have spoken with their colleagues previously. I kept my email short and to the point, as many of the people don’t have the time to read your life story so save it for the call. Remember that they are doing this to help you and they receive little to no benefit by speaking to you so be courteous of their time. I never send emails on Fridays or weekends and try to schedule them to send in the mornings or after lunchtime as that is a big time when people check their emails.

Hi (Name),

I am currently a Finance student at (University) with a focus on Real Estate. **I came across your profile while I was browsing** **(Person’s Company)** **LinkedIn profile.** I am trying to learn as much as I can from people's experiences and success in the industry. If you have time, I would love to set up a call to discuss your career and particularly speak about (something you are particularly interested in). I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

**Follow up 1-**

Follow up emails are the most important thing when cold emailing to try and set up a call. I like to keep the follow ups short as the big reason you are sending the follow up is to get the email you sent previously back to the top of their inbox. It is common for people to open email and forget to respond or it just gets lost in their inbox, so it is good to send a follow up. I send the follow up by replying to the email I sent previously. I send my first follow up 3 days after email 1 and never send follow ups on Fridays or weekends and try to schedule them to send in the mornings or after lunchtime.

Hi (Name),

Hope you are well.

I just wanted to follow up regarding the email I sent on (Date you sent the previous email). I would love to set up a call with you to learn from your success in the CRE space if you have the time.

**Follow up 2-**

This is the last follow up email I generally send but you can send less or more I just prefer 2 for no reason. Once again, we are just trying to get back to the top of their inbox.

(Name) - I wanted to reach out again regarding the email I sent on (Date you sent Email 1). I understand you are busy but, if possible, I would love to set up a short call to learn from your success in the industry. I look forward to hearing from you thank you

**Follow up and thank you email-**

I have no template for the thank you email as I customize each thank you email 100% to the person I have spoken to. Also, I send the thank you the following day.

**General and Tips-**

·  Treat every call like you are on a call with the President of the United States. Be respectful, thankful, and do not waste their time. I try to not extend my call beyond 30 minutes but try to keep it closer to 15 minutes

·  Don’t fear rejection. You will constantly get no replies but keep going and making yourself uncomfortable.

·  **Don’t ask for internships.** In my quick little summary about me at the beginning of the call I will mention I am currently looking for an internship.

·  Get onto every call with the intent of learning. Always keep an open mind and constantly ask questions.

·  Keep everything organized it will be much easier and less stressful if you stay organized

**Excel Tracker-**

I have attached the excel template that I created to keep track of all my emails and connections.

u9lqgs,3,2022-04-22,Tips to secure my first IT Job (mainly repairing printers),FilGoncalves,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/u9lqgs/tips_to_secure_my_first_it_job_mainly_repairing/,"Hey guys.

I'm going to work for a week (experience, to see if they like the way I work) mainly as a printer technician but also some other IT stuff like repairing PCs, etc... 

This is a very important opportunity for me because it means I can stop working as cook and do what I love most (and maybe getting out of my parents house... You don't wanna know what's going on around here). 
I was actually the only one candidate who knew more things about printers than the other candidates, mainly because I had an internship in a selling and repairing printers company when I was at school. It looks that they really liked the way I spoke and the experience I had. 

I'm still at my early 20's and I really wanna succeed at this but I'm afraid I may not know some important things mainly because, as I said, I've been working as a cook for a while now, for paying the bills and because of some dumb decisions I've made when I was younger. And this will be my first real ""rodeo"" in a company like this with more responsibilities. 

So, IT Technicians of Reddit , what are some useful things that you learnt that I should know to secure that job? Thanks :)"

**The world was falling apart around me.**

When I was a kid, I was proud of my heritage as a human. A Descendant. Now though, with the Constitutional Crisis and all the unrest, I'm not sure. I had been serving the Emperor for six years now. I know he is one of our best. One of the best people the Empire has to offer. It didn't matter. The decades of Emperor Michaels' rule was coming to an end. The once prosperous Empire that I grew up in was falling apart in a matter of a decade.

A knock sounded at my door. I sat up from my chair and went to the door. I opened it.

""Yes?"" I asked.

A young man was on the other side, likely an intern. ""Sir, I have news of the Zayon vote to secede from the Empire. They voted in favor.""

""That's unconstitutional,"" I said as I swiftly grabbed my coat and beckoned the intern to follow me. I began walking down the hall of my apartment toward the elevator. Once inside, I began questioning him more.

""What was the vote margin?""

""I heard it was large enough not to call a recess and revote among our pro-empire folks in Zayo,"" the intern responded.

I grumbled and walked out the elevator as I hopped in my car. I had the intern get in the passenger seat.

""We're going to hang that piece of shit Kaunchin and his little cabal of traitors,"" I said as we backed up and left the parking garage. The streets on Profectum were a mess right now. Many people were hoarding supplies. The mineral resource scare from the Sirius and Zayo independence movements were causing fusion plants to enter rolling blackouts across Sinclon and many other star systems in the Empire.

As I continued down the city toward the Profectum Palace, I noticed multiple riots occurring in the streets as people were losing money, jobs, food, and more. A sight that I never though I'd see.

We finally reached the grandiose palace. The marble protruding from the ground was wonderous, but nowhere near comparison to the grand Palace in Sinclon, our capital. I parked in a lot nearby and walked with the intern. The guards knew me, so they let us in. They were panicked as the riots seemed to be making their way to the Profectum Palace. After nearly five minutes of walking, we reach the Emperor's briefing room.

I bowed on sight, ""Emperor,"" I stated.

The Emperor was a little despondent, ""Charles. It is good to see you.""

""My Emperor, it is time to crush this insurrection in Zayo and show Sirius and the other star systems that their place is within the Empire. Without us, foreign threats would pervade human-occupied star systems and slowly annihilate our race,"" I urged him.

""Charles,"" he said, his voice a little sharp, ""I will not tolerate xenophobia. They would not annihilate our species. Back to what you were saying... I hold the opinion that we should hold a referendum to dissolve the Empire.""

I widened my eyes, shocked, ""My Emperor, that's a horrible idea-"" I was interrupted by a series of the Cabinet members walking in.

He repeated his idea to them and they had the same reaction.

""Milord! We can't let the Empire dissolve. We all know the Masren are just *waiting* to take the nearby star systems that we occupy,"" Jesse Trout, the Director of Foreign Affairs said.

""If the people wish for freedom, should we not give it to them?"" Emperor Michael responded. He sat down and his suit crumpled a little; he stared out the window.

To his question, many of the Cabinet was silent. I would not be.

""My lord, it is of my strong opinion that this referendum must not take place. Instead, we must restore the stability of the Empire by crushing these rebellious politicians in Zayo and Sirius.""

An urgent knock sounded at the door. Two guards burst in after a few seconds.

""My lord, esteemed Cabinet! The rioters have currently reached the outer gate. It is our recommendation we move you to a safer spot in the building.""

Everyone complied. I followed close with the Emperor. I heard the crashing of glass on the walls outside. The guards looked panicked as they listened to their earpieces. They hurried us and we passed by a window. A molotov entered and burst the halls into flames. The Emperor was on the other side with a small security detail. I didn't know what to do. I stood there. A guard had to drag me off. I heard gunshots and snapped to attention. I served in the Descendant-K'Myr war. I suffered from it. 

I followed the guard as he brought the Cabinet to a safer location in the building. It was a safe room. They secured it and the guards created a killbox at the door. Meanwhile, guards were defending the wing we were in. I wasn't worried about us. I was worried about the Emperor.

There was a television in the room. I was allowed to use it, but only with subtitles, no sound. I turned it on and went to Profectum news. Multiple aircraft were covering it and the media was dubbing it,

***Unrest at Profectum turns into revolt.***

I sat watching, silently. Many other Cabinet members did as well. As time went on, more gunfire was heard and the guards entered a different portion of the saferoom to communicate with guards outside.

Ten minutes passed. Twenty. Then, the guards walked into the main area.

""The building and surrounding area is clear. The military had to be used for assistance,"" one of them said.

What a disaster.

I walked out of the room and walked around the palace. The place was destroyed by the very people that it served. The marble and wood was spread across rooms. Furniture destroyed. Government documents. All I could think was how destructive humans were. 

I started thinking about the Emperor. I began looking around and asking for him. Most had no idea. One guard referred me to the Head of the Royal Protection Force. She was on scene as part of the military response to the attack on the Profectum Palace. I began looking for the Head of the RPF and found a series of tents outside the palace. There was a variety of military and police assets present. I entered a few tents looking for the woman as I noticed EMTs treating many for injuries. I checked that area before happening upon my intended target talking to some military officers.

""Sheila?"" I asked her.

She turned around, crying a little. Surprised dawned on her face, but it was still tinged with sorrow.

""Charles!"" she said coming to hug me, crying now, ""Michael.. he died.""

A sorrow plunged into my heart and soul. I expected it at this point. The Emperor wasn't one to hide away after an incident like this. I asked her how.

""His detail and him encountered armed protestors. It wasn't even them that killed him. The structural integrity of the building was weakened by the fires,"" she said, catching her breath, ""and an oven fell through the floor and crushed the Emperor. It was just horrible luck."" She continued to sob.

All I could do was hug her back.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

With the death of Emperor Michael, the Descendant Civil War started. The federal government only kept control of two star systems. The Federal District of Sin and the new Federal District of Centurion, where planet Profectum was located. A large memorial was built on the former grounds of the Profectum Palace.

Senator Kaunchin and anti-imperial politicians voted to breakaway from the Empire. Without a strong central government and massive upheaval, nothing could be done about it. This was soon followed by the Sirius systems and most of the Descendant Empire.

Sinclon was declared under martial law for the 'foreseeable future' as the military created a junta in the Federal Districts. Foreign nations sent aid to various human star systems. Some governments were unwilling to leave their pride and refused the aid.

Within the ensuing decade of civil war, over 728 million Descendants would die. This is nearly 14.5% of the Descendant population.

However, a unifying force was coming from Earth.

At this point, I'm expanding a broad universe with a bunch of one-shot stories. I don't want to start any series because I want to explore all of these different perspectives and stories. I will rarely, if ever, follow the same character in my stories."

I was also taking classes during the summers, so I wasn't able to get an internship then. I live in southern Mississippi, so there aren't too many tech jobs around the area.

The reason that I haven't had time for the job search is because I changed majors starting in the fall of my junior year, so I've had to take double the amount of classes, so between my work-study job in the school's enterprise services department, going to class, and studying, I haven't really had the time to do anything. I was also taking classes during the summers, so I wasn't able to get an internship then. I live in southern Mississippi, so there aren't too many tech jobs around the area.

u9nre3,1,2022-04-22,"Changing major from CSE to CS. Is it possible? If so, should I do it?",bostonlobstergang,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/u9nre3/changing_major_from_cse_to_cs_is_it_possible_if/,"I got accepted to UC Davis for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and while I haven't committed to Davis just yet, there's a high chance I'll attend here. 

I am wondering if it's possible to change major to CS from CSE. The reason I want to do so is because I didn't particularly do well in science classes (physics, chemistry) in high school and didn't enjoy much either. I did well in Computer Science and Math classes, however, so I'm thinking maybe I should take CS that doesn't require as much science credits as CSE. I also heard the requirements are lighter for CS, so I could maybe spend more time working on personal CS projects / work on leetcode (which would be beneficial for internships), rather than spend all my time working on problem sets for the science classes. 

Is it easy to change major like that, given that I'm current CSE major? Would you recommend doing so? If I can't change I would still honestly be happy with CSE since I'm still studying CS, but it seems like majoring in CS best aligns with my goal in college."
u9ntst,41482,2022-04-22,TIFU telling my parents about my inheritance,TIFUwhyyyyyyymeeeeee,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u9ntst/tifu_telling_my_parents_about_my_inheritance/,"TLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now they’re gonna sue me. 


My 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so it’s been pretty difficult to deal with. I’m in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. She’d be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She would’ve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first. 

When she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had an extremely large amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I was unaware but she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired.  She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She had explained she wanted to use this house for college housing eventually. This was all extremely overwhelming to hear. She left nothing to my parents but as they didn’t know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and I’m very low contact. We are their only two children. 

At the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them I’d continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didn’t know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them I’d be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them it’s my home and it was willed to me. They couldn’t sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time. 

Cue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now we’re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this. 

just some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.

Fixed spelling mistakes

edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. I’ve gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. It’s fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, I’ll be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so I’ll be continuing her business too and I’ll need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I don’t know it’s overwhelming.

edit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didn’t know they’d even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesn’t say anything about them but I’m leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.

Final Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but won’t push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and I’ll give an official update at some point."

Immediately after, I got a part time job as a TA at Michigan State University's full stack web development boot camp (different boot camp than the one I graduated from). I feel incredibly lucky and blessed because not only is Blockchain development a dream job for me, but after hearing how difficult it is break into the tech field, I was worried it would take me at least 6-8 months to land my first job/internship as a developer. I was lucky enough to land two programming related jobs within less than a month. The best part? They are both remote!"

Any advice is greatly appreciated bc I am torn between each one. For a bit of background I am a TS/SCI with FSP cleared person.

Job 1: EV company that I previously interned with. WLB is virtually nonexistent and I put in 70 hours/week pretty often during my internship. High growth company but my clearance would go inactive.

TC: 105k in a high cost of living area. 

Job 2: Federal government Intelligence Agency. Pretty cool team with a very unique mission. WLB would be great but I am not sure about career progression.

TC: 94k and I could live at home with almost zero expenses.

Job 3: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. WLB would be good but I would be the sole engineer inside of a SCIF for 10 hour shifts. A SCIF is basically a cubicle where I cant even access the internet. Clearance would stay active.

TC: 175k in a medium COL area that is very up and coming.

I am the first person in my family to go to university and get an opportunity like this. Any advice/insight is appreciated."
u9qccw,0,2022-04-22,I’m going to lose my 4.0 and this semester. How can I compensate for this loss?,walrusdog32,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/u9qccw/im_going_to_lose_my_40_and_this_semester_how_can/,"First off before you downvote, I don’t see my 4.0 in a sense to show off or an award, sort of. But the feeling I had when I hit my 4.0 just made me feel really good, because I wasn’t like this in high school and now when I hit it- I had this sense of motivation to try each semester, then halfway 3/4 this semester I slacked so badly in some classes and it bonked my exam scores.

However, I do want to shed some light and improve myself in becoming a good stem student. I’m in a couple clubs myself (athletics) and they don’t really relate. But I guess I was wondering what are things you can do that might be good in the long run possibly? Internship opportunities I can take in the future summers, learning python or doing some coding? Working on some projects?

I hope I’m not giving a bad impression on the statements I’ve made, but I am accepting my loss."

u9rwcj,8,2022-04-22,"Uhhh, what?",AdamJadam,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/u9rwcj/uhhh_what/,"Job Type: Internship

Pay: $10.00 - $15.00 per hour

Schedule:

* 8 hour shift
* Monday to Friday

COVID-19 considerations:Remote work

Experience:

* Marketing: 3 years (Preferred)

Work Location: Remote

First, I thought it was absurd that they want someone with 3 years of experience in marketing at $10-$15 an hour.  Then, further down they called in an internship.  Um.... you want an intern who has worked in marketing for 3 years and will take less than some states give as minimum wage?  Yeah... ok sure...

u9s6m5,7,2022-04-22,How much does research/internships offset bad gpa?,SNOSOO,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/u9s6m5/how_much_does_researchinternships_offset_bad_gpa/,"Hi guys, I’ll be applying this cycle and I just want some feedback if it’s possible to get into a computational biology/bioinformatics PhD program with my stats or if I’m being ridiculous.


2.71 gpa, molecular cell bio major
2 years experience in an applied genomics lab
Harvard biostatistics internship (this summer)
Just got accepted into a new lab on campus to get more bioinformatics/biostats experience on current research
Few presentations at symposiums

I have stellar letter of recommendations as well which is what really helped me get into the new lab/internship 

I worked full time (40+ hours) during the entirety of my academic career. It took me almost 10 years just to complete my bachelors (community college to university). I’ve been homeless while trying to juggle classes and work. It’s no excuse, it’s just been stressful.  

Any advice or anything I should expect for admissions? Should I only apply to MS programs? Any ideas on how to get MS programs fully funded?"
u9sezs,277,2022-04-22,I BSed my way into a 35$/hour internship in linux yet i don’t know much linux at all. Help,TravelTraditional755,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/u9sezs/i_bsed_my_way_into_a_35hour_internship_in_linux/,"The title says it all. I somehow BSed my way into an internship that pays 35$/hour that starts in about 6 weeks yet i don’t know a lot of Linux. I need to learn linux so i dont embarrass myself at this internship and so i can hopefully get invited back next summer. 

I would do best with something that’s either gamified or online modules. I’m not good at just looking at commands and then executing them or understanding. Unsure how much I’m willing to spend, preferably under 100.

Edit: thanks so much for all the replies. I’ll probably look into linux journey or udemy. A reason the pay is so high, in my opinion, is because I’m a grad student.

Edit 2: comments saying “just google it” aren’t helpful. As i stated in the post i can’t learn that way. Hence why i ask for other methods of learning.

Edit 3: thanks again for all the advice. I’m writing it down and gonna start on the Udemy course first. I also want to make it clear that i do know some linux and I’ve done a decent amount of programming before. However none of my previous internships were in programming and when i learned Linux in school, i had personal things going on. I couldn’t dedicate everything to my studies so i don’t remember a lot. I’m trying right now to get better and it honestly is disheartening to see some of the aggressive or hostile comments. Anyway, thanks again for all the suggestions. I really appreciate it."

But if your trying to go for normal companies that's not FAANG for fall, you should start now, correct?"
u9v40x,1,2022-04-22,Internship or Family?,PolyglotAndONCE,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/u9v40x/internship_or_family/,"Hey everyone, I’ve been stressed about this decision for a long time, and really need some different opinions on the matter. I (18M) recently got a research internship where I’m paid to continue a project in-person that I started with a professor a while ago. It’s very unlikely that I’ll receive this opportunity again because it seems rare that first-years (me) get it. I could always work on this project remotely and unpaid, but I’ve been itching to do this project in-person and on my college campus (housing and app provided as well). The program starts on June 6 and ends on August 12. The conflicting factor is a family gathering that is happening in India (a coming-of-age ceremony for my nephew) as well as my parents buying an apartment (and the house-warming). This will probably be one of the last times I see my extended family in a while (even though I feel not as connected to them being from the US), but I care about them deeply (especially my grandparents). I could always go to India for research and be paid to do so next summer, but I will miss all of these cornerstone family events. My ticket is with my family on the 29th of May, and I even got permission from my summer research program to extend my start date to the 8th of June 2022. This obviously doesn’t do much for my case, and my parents think it’s a waste of money for me to fly for basically four days (and alone coming back). The jetlag would be extremely hard to deal with as well, but not impossible maybe. I would feel guilty if I chose either option, as I would love to see my family, but also work in an internship that I’m passionate about (and even have one my freshman year, as at my school there’s an expectation for such). I’m really confused and lost, any advice would be really appreciated!

TL;DR - should I go abroad and see my family (as I won’t be able to later on most likely), or take a summer research position?"

How will this job look to recruiters when I apply for internships next year. I will probably stay with this job for around 2 years as I only need to work 12 hours a week during the school year and 20hrs a week during the summer. Will it increase the number of interviews I get, will it be a good talking point? I'm just trying to figure out what potential opportunities this position may give me. 

\*In specific the position uses PHP, HTML, CSS, javascript, Drupal cms, Linux, and maybe some python scripting.

Any input would be appreciated."
u9x6hw,6,2022-04-23,Is an Associates degree enough?,Encrypted_Zero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/u9x6hw/is_an_associates_degree_enough/,"Good evening, I am 20 and in the last 4 weeks of a Software Development Associates program. I have had 1 remote unpaid internship that lasted 3 months. Now I am starting an Java internship for $25 an hour (pretty solid for my area/age). If I do good they will hire me. My question is do I need a Bachelors degree? I have already been accepted into a 4 year college and I have credit transfer so I’d be going in as a junior. I don’t particularly want to go to school for longer, as I’m passionate about programming but not school. Most jobs in my area require a Bachelors or equivalent experience. I have a friend who is at the end of his Junior year and he isn’t familiarly with half of the languages/frameworks I use (C#, Asp.Net, and Kotlin). To me it seems silly to go and take a bunch of gen-eds and math for a few upper level CS classes. Although this job said I could take 1 day off of work a week for school if I got hired. Should I just slow play it and take a few classes at a time, or just go into the field?"
u9xf4b,6,2022-04-23,"In embedded systems engineering, what's the relationship between unit testing code via a testing framework and hardware testing, such as using an oscilloscope/logic analyzer to see if information is being sent successfully?",dcfan105,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/u9xf4b/in_embedded_systems_engineering_whats_the/,"Context: I'm a firmware test engineering intern and my project involves using the I2C communication protocol to test a bunch of FTDI I2C library functions and then use them to read information from an accelerometer.  At this point, I'm  pretty comfortable with how to use the FTDI functions.  I tested the single byte read procedure on the accelerometer's WhoAmI register and it worked.  I then copy/pasted the test code into the body of one of my wrapper functions, I2CMasterRead, removed all the test asserts and modified the code to read from the register that the function takes in instead of the 
WhoAmI register specifically.  Then I put that into my ReadOrientation function, which, as the name implies, as supposed to read the value giving the accelerometer's orientation from the register the documentation indicates holds that information.  However, this functions gives some really strange results as shown when I used a logic analyzer to check what was being written and read.

I know the single byte read procedure between the FTDI test device and the accelerometer works because I tested it separately, so I'm guessing I did something wrong in either modifying the code to put it in the I2CMasterRead function or in setting stuff up to read specifically from the orientation register.  My question is, what type of testing/debugging procedure is generally considered best practice for this type of situation?   My original plan was just to separately unit test each of my wrapper functions, since I wrote the functions such that changing one function definition shouldn't require any changes to the other functions.  But as I was working on the unit testing last night, I realized that, a. it was a lot more work than I anticipated and I ended heavily up modifying definition of my Read/WriteSetUp function to make it easier to test by making its side effects more transparent, and b., it wasn't necessarily going to give the information I actually care about anyway — whether the correct data was successfully read.  I did complete the full unit testing of my set-up function, since that was just calling all the FTDI functions that get the relevant info from the FTDI test device and the logic analyzer would be no help with checking that.  But I'm unsure if it's worth the hassle of setting up the tests for the I2CMasterRead function though.  I obviously need to test if it's doing what I want it do to narrow down if the problem is what it or the ReadOrientation function itself, but I think it'd be easier to just use the logic analyzer.  But then, since I'm still pretty new to code testing in general, I also feel that might be short-sighted and that I'll miss something by relying only on the hardware testing."
u9xn5j,20,2022-04-23,UCI or CAL (Math major) as a transfer?,Altruistic-Use-948,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u9xn5j/uci_or_cal_math_major_as_a_transfer/,"Hi everyone! Before I explain my situation, I want to take a second to just take in the fact that I'm actually on this sub saying I got into Berkeley. I truly never thought this would happen to me, and I feel like a different person than I was just 6ish hours ago now that I have this huge opportunity in front of me. 

That said, I have no idea if I should actually go to Cal. So let me compare the two for you so you can see what I value, and don't, about each school

UCI \~

\- pro: close to family and my pets (I'm from LA); I also have extended family in orange county and san diego. I like the idea that UCI is just a drive away from home if I ever need or want to be there. 

\- pro: a very familiar campus; I've visited UCI many times since I had a sibling who went there

\- pro: a lot of friends who go there and I already have off-campus housing lined up for if I chose UCI. I also have friends at UCSD that I can drive down a couple hours to see once in a while

\- con: math program is ranked #147 in the U.S

\- cons: the rest of the cons would just be academics and career-related. I'll of course do my best with the opportunities I have, but what if I just won't have many opportunities?

Cal \~

\- pro: math program is ranked #4 in the U.S.

\- pro: I love how well-known cal is for being outspoken about political and social issues, even if it can sometimes seem dumb or too much. I've visited once, and also love how the campus looks

\- pros: I think the rest of the pros would just be academics and career-related. I'm assuming Cal would give me quite a boost in finding and acquiring internships and EL jobs

\- con: I only have one friend there who's been there as a freshman and has her own friend group. I'm pretty social and it would prob only take a few texts to catch up with her and meet up but I'm still freaking myself out about it like she wouldn't want me to hang out with her and her friends, even though she's like the nicest friend I have from high school

\- con: soooooo far away from home. I'm not familiar with the area at all. A part of me thinks I'll be homesick a lot. 

So all said and done, I think my cons for Cal are just that I'm scared. But I'm also worried that, if I choose UCI for being convenient, I'll always wonder what could've been. My mom really prefers UCI bc of all my pros, but she understands my pros for Cal too and my parents will definitely support me if I choose Cal. Also, side note, if I get into UCLA (which is a HUGE if, considering I never thought my application would get me into Cal), I would choose UCLA because it's familiar and has an awesome math program too. What do yall think?"
u9yl9l,3,2022-04-23,I am burnt out 1 month into classes,UseOrdinary8195,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/u9yl9l/i_am_burnt_out_1_month_into_classes/,"It’s barely been a month and I’m struggling to stay afloat and I need advice. 

I’m taking 5 classes (1 PE) 4 regular full-credit classes. 2 of them are hard STEM classes, and one of them is a math class that is damn near indecipherable to me. Normally I can understand math by reading the textbook copiously and I am fine with doing that and putting in lots of work - that’s generally how math classes go. I could’ve done that with this class and I would’ve probably been ok if I had been able to do that - but because of my other classes, I don’t have enough time. And my GPA is already not very high so it’s not good that I’m barely passing at this point. I can’t really afford to get all Bs or Cs this term, and I’m definitely tending towards that, since I would like to get internships and possibly go to grad school.
The other classes are not much better tbh - it’s simply that I have too much work to do well in them. 

I also commute to campus so there’s that extra back and forth with parking that takes up time. 

And physically, I’m suffering a lot. I’m getting tremors throughout my body from the stress of it all and yesterday I slept for 9 hours and still was struggling to stay awake during classes because I’m so exhausted from working all the time. I have to drink coffee as well otherwise I can’t stay awake and it makes me extremely jittery but it’s the only thing that’ll keep me awake during class. 

I work/study 24/7, no time for other things. My only “free time” (it’s not free, I just take it because I have to) I use for naps because I am so exhausted from working and cramming on half the nights. No free time even on weekends. 
I am unable to engage with my peers properly because of the physical and mental symptoms I have from overworking and stress, even ones I would normally be able to. 
And lastly, it’s affecting my wellbeing.
The major problem is that I have quite a few Ws on my transcript already and if I drop any of them now I will get a withdrawal or W on my transcript.
I really don’t know what to do. Is this normal for college? This is the first time I’ve taken a full load of classes (more than 12 credits).
I am so caught in my head trying to figure out how to stay afloat real life is getting very hard. 
Can someone advise me on what to do? 
Should I stick it out?
Or drop the math or other and get a W?"

* Asian male, born in US
* Current Junior at T15 UG Business School | Business Major with Business CS Minor
* GMAT: 750 | GPA: 3.6/4.0 (GPA excluding freshman year: 3.95/4.00)

Work Experience:

* Incoming summer internship in investment banking, Goldman Sachs TMT
* Summer internship in investment banking, lower MM firm - received return offer but declined
* Founder of Startup that raised six-figure pre-seed round at multiple million dollar valuation and had $10K MRR
* Founder of Startup that grew to almost $1M in ARR and was acquired my freshman year. (Also why GPA is low this year)

EC’s

* Founder and President of an Entrepreneurship committee that centralized all of the entrepreneurship organizations on campus under one centralized platform
* President of Entrepreneurship Club
* Co-Founder and President of a Chapter of a non-profit focusing on curating the next leaders of finance at different Universities across the US
* President of Club that provides mentorship and lessons in financial literacy and personal finance to underprivileged high school kids
* Previously founded Non-profit Foundation (501c3) helping over 500+ homeless people in high school

Goals:

* I want to pursue entrepreneurship specifically within Tech and having a deferred admission would allow me to take more risk after my analyst stint in IB, I could potentially join a either early stage (Series A) or later stage startup in a operation/strategy role to further my understanding for operations and have industry expertise to hopefully start something during my MBA with the resources they can provide and the network.

Questions/Concerns

* Worried my GPA is low for target schools H/S (maybe W)
* Is an MBA even worth it for entrepreneurship?
* Will interning at a startup/startup accelerator (YC/Techstars) during the fall/spring next year help my application or waste of time? "

I was told by my friend to ask the company to work around my schedule, and I thought this was a great idea. I’m set on transferring, so I have to take the course.

I'm 19 just faced A level and have no prior professional experience except freelancing. Although I'm a bit educated on the theoretical side and have a history of good performance in competitions even competing with under grads. Founder and one employee of the startup comes from the same background as me so i thought that's why they gave me the job. 

About the pay, i expected to be get paid like an intern. So let's say X. Then they offered me 10X. No exaggeration. I expected intern pay and they offered me an above average SE salary. So I'm not complaining and got to work. And this is flexible timing and remote. We meet up like twice a month.

My problem is, I don't do much and i feel guilty about getting paid that much. I wanna do alot but my progress is slow. Like i code something, then push it wait for comments then Submit a PR and i got nothing to do while someone reviews it. For 2 days i was working on touch gestures of a pdf reader.  Kind if having the imposters syndrome i guess. 

Sorry for the rant and so how much do junior devs work normally? How bad am i?"

ua1mzr,23,2022-04-23,"My life has imploded. Apartment is a disgusting, horrible mess where I can't find anything. Important deadline approaching. I feel trapped &amp; lost. Support, encouragement, empathy needed :&lt;",Late-Virus,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ua1mzr/my_life_has_imploded_apartment_is_a_disgusting/,"I'm really in need of support :( I'm 31, have studied at three different universities but never got a degree out of any of them. My life has always, a l w a y s been a chaos - ever since I can remember, my room was a horrible mess. I was always forgetting things. I hyperfixated on school &amp; books, so that's why no one ever thought of ADHD (being a girl is also a factor...). My parents were awful to me. They called me disgusting, they loathed that I stayed up late and then couldn't get up in the morning. They couldn't handle my temper so dad used to hit me with a belt, drag me by my hair, once he locked me out of the house without any shoes during winter. I grew up with zero self-esteem, hating myself, not seeing how I could be valuable, or how I was also allowed to pursue happiness. Depression, self-harming, problems with alcohol in my mid-20s.

I have worked *so hard* these last few years. Sometimes I'm amazed at how much more empathy and kindness I have towards myself, compared to my early 20s. I'm now really, really trying to finish my bachelor's. I'm so embarrassed to be thirty-fucking-one and people over a decade younger than me are faring better. But this is my journey, my growth. Compared to my peers, I'm so far behind. But compared to *me,* oh how much I've grown! 

But I'm really struggling now. Really really really bad. I have an important deadline next Wednesday for my bachelor's thesis and I haven't done anything. I also have an exam that day that I can't skip (literally won't graduate without passing that one exam). I was so determined at the beginning of this year, I made all these schedules, all these plans on how I could achieve this. But these last few weeks I've just.... imploded? I can't do shit. I've skipped lectures, been sleeping in my day clothes &amp; make-up. I feel stuck in my apartment, it's such a complete mess. Last week I took out the trash - took me FIVE trips to get it all!! You can only imagine how out of order everything is. Clothes everywhere. I have a lot of arts &amp; crafts supplies and I get these impulsive projects, so I take out the stuff I need, start the project, never finish it and yeah. A mess!! My kitchen table is full of stuff, literally piled up. So is my desk. My sofa. I've been meaning to re-organize for probably months now, I make such good plans but when I open the door... I get so defeated. It will take *days* if not *weeks.* I can't study in this mess. It has worked well for me to go to the library, but for this deadline I need the resources I have at home. But I can't....... I also have bulimia, and it has been really bad these last few weeks. I've wasted so much money on binging and purging and binging and purging. I come home, I think ""now just open the file. Just do something. Just open the file and then go on youtube, but just open it"" and I CAN'T!!   


I don't have anyone I could ask to help me, they always comment on how much stuff I have and I can't fucking handle it now. I can't!! I know I should get rid of stuff, I know I know I know I know all of it!!  
I'm not diagnosed yet, a doctor who's never met me or never even spoken to me decided that since there were no indicators in my childhood health care files, I must not have ADHD. He said that alcohol use etc. could explain the symptoms. So alcohol, that I started consuming at the age of 16, could explain the symptoms I've had *ever since I can remember????* I'm so tired. I know I need to fight this and get a second opinion, because my life can be so unbearably hard and the idea of there being an explanation to all this and maybe medication that could make me a functioning human being has been a lifeline. And it's been taken away. How can I explain to my thesis instructor that yeah I might have ADHD but no diagnosis so I'm just a lazy piece of shit idiot fuck and that's why I haven't done anything hahaha

I wish I had the money to hire a professional organizer. I just might take some out of my savings, because I feel so stuck, trapped, disgusting... I can't invite anyone over, getting ready to go anywhere is a struggle because I can't find my clothes, my makeup, my bags, my anything in this mess. It's a struggle. 

This post is a mess. I really need some empathy, some kindness, some gentle words. I feel so trapped. Outside of all this I'm doing an internship at a really awesome place and I also work at my regular job. Then there's the lectures and everything. Somehow I do have a lot of free time that I use doing *fuck all*. I think I've lost perspective. Maybe I should just splurge on that organizer thing? I feel so so so so so lost otherwise. If anyone can relate I'd love to hear it. I think I have internalized my parents' absolute disgust and disdain about my lack of organization so badly that I'm absolutely spiraling at this. I also haven't been taking my meds (for anxiety, depression &amp; sleeping issues - the medication works wonders in keeping these symptoms at bay most of the time) as I should this week since my sleeping schedule has been so irregular. You can probably tell haha...

I (22F) have been studying and getting good grades, winning awards being a good student, tries to be a good daughter my whole life until now. I can’t do it anymore. 

I can’t seem to put myself to study. I don’t enjoy the things like I used to. All those years I gave up extra activities I was good at: singing, volleyball and art, I only focused on studying getting good grades. I managed to get into good schools and now I’m an engineering student. 

But I’m a total failure. I don’t seem to enjoy coding I can’t put myself to study. I have total 13 subjects fail (backlogs).  I can’t seem to learn new skills, I can’t seem to do anything properly. 
I am not motivated all I do is feel sad and cry. Feel hopeless. It’s too late to drop the course or pick something new, financially not an option. 

I don’t blame anyone else but me. My parents have sacrificed a lot and provided for my little sister (16) and I. We’re a middle class family, having to give these exams over and over again costs money, as the older daughter I want to help them provide for my family in any way including finances. I don’t want to make them worry so I can’t tell them the truth I can’t show them how pathetic I feel. I’ve never cried in front of them, I’ve never complained it was difficult for me or I was having troubles, I tried my best, I have to be reliable for my parents and sister. Yet it still doesn’t motivate me to be better. 

I have done some part time jobs and internships which are over now. With these many subject failures I’m too scared to apply for jobs in tech. I feel like I’m not good enough, no skills seems like I can’t learn any or perfect any. 

I need to talk to someone but I feel like there’s no one. Not my family, or sister ( she had an anxiety attack last time during her exams), so I pretend I’ve got everything under control. Like I’m managing everything, like I’m the reliable daughter and sister. But it’s a lie, I’m faking it. 

I don’t have cousins, my dad’s side of the family, we don’t talk ( cause they tried to hurt my mom and I when I was 5 : a diff story) and my mom’s side of the family well they took her in, exchange for her services like house work, taking care of her siblings ( she’s the oldest) etc they gave her food shelter education. My mom always says her side of the family now shows her respect, treats her well because of how her daughter is so good in her studies and perfect. ( I am not sadly) 

I can’t show weakness, I can’t talk to anyone. All I do is cry, we share a room so I don’t have privacy at home and I have to cry softly not making a sound, I have brown skin so it takes about 5 mins to look normal and not puffy. 
 
I’ve cried so much I feel numb. I have an exam tomorrow, re test for one of the subject I failed which I’m skipping because I can’t remember anything I studied, I am wasting my life , my time my family’s energy and money. I feel like a spoiled brat yet I can’t get up and make myself do anything. 

I want to see a therapist like even for one session but financially that might not be available at the moment. I have no one to talk to. I feel alone. Friends, I have friends who can’t relate my problem at all, I want to escape reality I don’t want to live feeling like this. Anime and kdrama give me a tiny bit of happiness but it’s not real. Watching those make me feel like I’m wasting more time. I’m hopeless not good enough my self esteem is low as ever, affects my thoughts to hate myself and my body, wishing I was different, happy, or even pretty. 
I’m too comfortable I hate myself.

ua5o3y,2,2022-04-23,I need advice on my situation with my submission paper on my 6th semester before I get to the written exams,Judgingyou98,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ua5o3y/i_need_advice_on_my_situation_with_my_submission/,"Hello to those who are reading this. I would like to receive some advice, please. I already posted this thread on r/advice beforehand.

Here's the situation:

I'm in my 6th semester at my training course to become a nursery nurse/daycare teacher and I submitted my paper on April 8th of this year. I'm putting myself the blame here and say that my time management is the worst as I like to push everything on the last minute to hope something good happens now. In this pandemic, it worked when I had to write my internship papers (a separate thing from my finals). It kinda got through somehow for the past few times and I'm really anxious about the last paper now. I, as the other papers above, bullshitted my way on the 7th to write my pages in one night. The requirements to submission are 20-30 pages and I only got to 19 (not including the index, sources and cover/Title page). It's under the requirements and if I'm being honest, I just wrote whatever came into my mind in order to fill out the pages without knowing what I'm writing there in the first place. Now, I have difficulty getting my thoughts to paper, especially when I think it's correct for myself, for others it might not. I wrote both my homeroom teacher about my concerns that I might be failing this course and might have to repeat the last year. I already did repeat a year in my 1st and 2nd semester (before the pandemic) and my school has the rule that you can't repeat again this course, unless you change the state that offers the same thing.

I wrote my homeroom teacher a mail that I would like to submit another page so that it'll meet the requirements and she told me it's fine, as long as I talked to the teacher that's correcting it beforehand if it's fine. She also told me that due to the pandemic conditions I wouldn't be able to change the state and would start in a different class so that instead of graduating in July/August, I'd be graduating next year in January/February.

I also talked to the teacher that's grading it and he told me the date for submission already passed on the 8th of April, where I submitted in time thankfully, and that there's no way I could submit a new one that shortly if the results are discussed on the 29th of April. In his words: It wouldn't be that dramatic. 

Now, I'm not only anxious, but also feeling furious about his answer. Yet, I'm mostly mad at myself here. 

I'm royally screwed in this case, I'm anxious, crying my eyes out as I'm typing here and just want to throw myself out of the window just so that I don't get my results back to tell me that I'm not passing. In the past days, I've been trying to re-edit some pages, but the sources and contents stay the same afterall. I planned to email him the newer version and print it out for him by Monday morning with the added pages. It's just two pages, instead of just 19 it would be 21 pages with corrections on grammar in every page, but the actual content stays the same now. 

I talked to my friends in my class about it, as we all share the same fears of not passing. They tried to encourage me but I still don't get the image out of my head that I'm a failure and dooming my future because if my incompetence to write sentences correctly.

I'm really scared of receiving the results on May 2nd and about my future. I don't want to repeat the grade, live with my parents longer and disappoint them even more than I already do. I just want to go to work already and earn my income to be a full functional adult.

Update: I wasted ~400€ in panic mode on scribbr.com regarding my paper as well and I'm getting my results of the correction hopefully by tomorrow morning. I added as a feature a red-thread-check to see if everything makes sense writing everything as it is. Then an understanding check, automatic Layout-Check, editing and proofreading everything. I'm not sure if I did make the right decision or not now..."

Or I can try to get a developer job to count as an “internship”.

I was even thinking of joining Revature to get experience if it’s difficult for me to find other developer jobs without a computer science degree because I already have a bachelor’s degree in another major (accounting). I heard bad things about Revature though so I’m hesitant to apply right now.

My plan this summer was to get better with leetcode in probably Python and learn React. I already kind of know html, css, and JavaScript. I’m pretty good with Java and c++. Now, I’ll have to apply for internship or a developer job. It kind of makes me want to drop out of college because of the requirement for internship.

ua8o4g,5,2022-04-23,Big Tech internship vs great local FT offer,BrakeDiscLegend,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ua8o4g/big_tech_internship_vs_great_local_ft_offer/,"Hi, 

I understand I am in a pretty odd and privileged position. And I know it is my choice to make, but maybe someone has some perspective that can change my decision for the better. 

**Context**: I am graduating this summer from a Masters in CS in western europe. I have already done a Big Tech (FAANG) internship last summer. I was still debating if I wanted to study one extra year, so I didnt accept the return offer and applied for another internship at several companies. 

I got accepted in an arguably better Big Tech company for another SWE internship in the upcoming summer (july-september).

However, I also started applying to new grad jobs in my local area, just to see what offers I could get. I was not expecting anything to come from it, since my area is not known for massive CS compensation, and I am open to move to large cities where I can make more money. This week I received an unexpected great offer, it is 30% higher than anything I've gotten before and what I've heard from my friends.

I have a feeling that if I want to stay in my local area, then I won't get anything better than this for new grad. However, I also want to gain experience at the other Big Tech, because it opens doors and I don't want to renege. But it the internship job description it mentions that applicants must have at least 1 semester left to complete (which I only have if I continue to study for 1 year).

My options thus are:

**1)** Dont accept great local FT offer. Do BigTech internship and study 1 more year. Possibly accept return offer.

**2)** Accept local FT offer. Renege BigTech internship.

**3)** Do FAANG internship and immediately after start at local company. Ignoring the extra semester rule. Possibly few years later move to BigTech using network built. (Is this acceptable? Is this not done?)

&amp;#x200B;

I think I prefer option 3 but I don't know how important the minimum 1 semester requirement is and maybe I'll get blacklisted at the FAANG company or whatever. The most important question I have is thus: ""How important is the 'minimum 1 semester of school after internship' requirement for an internship?"".

Any perspective or opinion is welcome. Thanks."

uaa59c,7,2022-04-23,"Graduating in mechanical engineering, discovered that I am not hands on or mechanically inclined at all",DieSchungel1234,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/uaa59c/graduating_in_mechanical_engineering_discovered/,"I graduated in December 2020 with a bachelors in mechanical. Prior to that I was studying physics and I dropped out of it because I did not believe in myself. I decided on mechanical because it was STEM and because I could graduate on time due to the overlap in classes. I took summer classes every summer so that I could graduate on time. 

I ended up graduating with no experience (internship canceled due to COVID), and luckily I managed to end up as a manufacturing engineer in a large multinational in early 2021. Well, let's just say I SUCK at it. It's been a year and I can barely turn a wrench. I even had trouble reading engineering drawings at first and also I find that I have trouble visualizing mechanical assemblies in my head. I am amazed when some technician starts talking about a machine or how something would/wouldn't work with just their mind. I was thinking about dropping out of engineering altogether but I decided to stick it out. Now I'm in my second year of the job and my role has more or less transitioned into a project manager kind of thing. 

However, I get super bored filling out excel sheets or doing mindless work, so I need a middle point in engagement between ""braindead"" and using my hands as the primary function of my job. There's days where I do nothing or very little. There's a couple times I really clutched and got some do or die projects done, but for the most part I would say that I am not really a ""manufacturing engineer"". All the technicians make fun of the engineers because they do most of the work.

I started getting into coding just to try and see if I would be good at it, and I am enjoying it. I was afraid of touching it for like 4 years because I failed my freshman level intro to programming class. I think that's a possible career. There are lots of things about electrical engineering that interest me as well. So let me make a list of my strengths/weaknesses and interests and I would love to get some input into some engineering paths I could be successful at. By the way, I've had 3 managers and I made clear to all 3 that this was probably not my best fit position and they all were cool with that, they always told me that finding your stride takes a while.

**Strengths**

* Highly analytical, can spend hour reading texts which other people would have a hard time
* Very persistent and learns new stuff day in and day out both in work and outside of it
* Good interpersonal skills and can easily mingle with blue and white collars workers seamlessly
* Able to break down projects and dive into them, can explain everything with ease to anyone, which I think is great because I notice that engineers tend to be very poor communicators

**Weaknesses**

* Poor organization (this needs to be corrected for any job either way)
* Poor dexterity
* Hard time imagining physical systems working, or finding improvements on a machine
* Can suffer hard impostor syndrome at times

**Favorite classes in college**

* Fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer
* Electricity and magnetism, physics
* Accounting elective, economics

**Classes I hated/did not care about in college**

* Anything manufacturing
* Machine design

**Classes that I liked but were not my favorite**

* Materials science
* Statics/Mechanics of materials"
uaabib,13,2022-04-23,Summer Opportunities,8lurpex,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uaabib/summer_opportunities/,"I have wasted the last summer, I do not want to waste this summer. So far I have learned basic algorithms and data structure, web design with web-based applications, and discrete math. I want to be ready for an internship next summer.

I have looked at some places and I found Android Development certificate program by Google. It's free apart from an examination fee and I can finish it before my classes start. How helpful will this be in helping me get an internship? 

I also want to take another course in C++ because most of the courses in my university are taught in it and it will help me get a head start. Do you have any recommendation on where to learn C++? A certificate or an equivalent would be nice, and as cheap as possible."
uaavgj,0,2022-04-23,Internship device question,iTzzKoLT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uaavgj/internship_device_question/,"So I got my first internship as a software engineer for a somewhat large company.  It is a remote internship and they told me they will be providing a laptop for me over the summer.  I am going to call them next week to see if type of laptop it would be but I was wondering if MacBook Pro would be a strong possibility.  I am more of a Windows guy but I really do like MacBooks, the build quality and screen, macOS I could get used to easily  and I see many people here using MacBook pros for their swe jobs.  So for internships, do they provide you options?  Maybe they only use Mac or Windows, I don't know yet but I am interested at what interns usually get or decide on if they are provided with options."

Long story short, I applied supper reach heavy since I got into a pretty good school early **(Rutgers New Brunswick)**, but after visiting and thinking for a while I'm having serious doubts that It's the school for me, and that I probably shot too high and too low at the same time. 

I didn't get in anywhere else but I did get waitlisted by NYU Tandon which makes me kind of hopeful I could get in to other places? 

I am not the typical A2C kid, I only really started looking into college apps last summer after two years of isolated quarantine. So I'm left with high stats but only really my own creative/passion pursuits in terms of ECs.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here's my overview:

**Income bracket: $140,000**

**Intended Major: CS**

**Sats:**

Copetetive-ish public HS (Average sat is 1200)

GPA: 3.9 uw, 4.4 w

Rank: N/A but told I was at the top my my counselor so lets say top 10%

SAT: 1530

9 APs by the end of senior year, have a 5 in APCS and a 4 in AP phys 

Took literally the most rigorous path course-wise possible at my school. 

**Awards:**

FIRST robotics - Inspire award 

**ECs:**

**Freelance 3d modeling work** \- Connect with clients to create customized 3d character rigs for their professional/personal use. Gained online presence/funded $5000 for my dream PC.

**FTC Robotics club (Robotics Engineer/Co-builder/Team Artist)** \- Assisted my team in assembling robots for FTC competitions/served as team artist in designing our posters/shirts. We qualified for state championship.

**Personal Zoological Research/Taxonomy Enthusiast** \- Self-directed research into biology, phylogenetics, and paleontology. Frequent reading of scientific journals and partake in online discussions. **(Wrote my commonapp essay on this, on how fish don't really exist and why that's everything to me.)**

**Multi-Medium Artist**\- Create art ranging from traditional sketches, digital illustrations, 3d blender models, and animations covering robot concepts to speculative zoology

**Family Chef** \- Support my parents via stovetop cooking for my brothers when my parents are too busy, I also usually cook for myself daily. 

**Physics/Math Peer Tutor** \- Responsible for aiding struggling juniors succeed in physics through private sessions. I also frequently coach my brothers in algebra.

along with:

**Weightlifting/Intramurals**

**Digital Content Creator** 

**Housework** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays:**

Pretty solid I'd say, spend a long ass time on them, wrote extremely personally, and got as much criticism as possible. A Cornell student once said my Cornell sups were engaging and a good read if that means much.

**Recs:**

Both from teachers I've known for 3 or 4 years so I'm sure they're alright

I just feel so overwhelmed and like things are passing by me so fast, I'm an eldest sibling, my parents are immigrants and my family mainly goes to CC, so I was not at all ""set up"" for collegeapps and feel so scared and confused. Rutgers will cost me 27k a year, I didn't get into the honors college and get no merit aid since I'm in-state. I'm also not dead-set on my major and have been thinking about mechE as much as CS. On top of that, I'm an artist and a frickin animal nerd, I am SO CONFUSED.

If I did take the gap (for which **I have 0 solid plans for** other than looking for employment, continuing freelance work, grinding on LinkedIn, looking for an internship and going on road trips, fishing, relaxing, and really thinking about my major), I'm looking at applying more realistically, you won't catch me applying to t20s this time around:

**University of Virginia - reach    (OOS tuition doe..? O\_o )** 

**University of Michigan--Ann Arbor  - reach   (OOS tuition doe..? O\_o )**

**Boston University - low reach/high target?**

**New York University - reach (again for funzies since I got waitlisted)**

**Ohio State University--Columbus - target?**

**Penn state - safety?**

  
I'd be more inclined to transferring if it wasn't for the fact that transferring looks like **such** a hassle, and that transfer students usually aren't eligible for honors colleges, get less aid/scholarships, and might be at a slight disadvantage for gradschool? 

Is it worth it to take a gap to apply smarter, think, and unwind, with the possibility of getting in somewhere with more opportunities and somewhere I like more, or should I go with Rutgers NB and dorm with my closest HS friends and maybe transfer depending on if it grows on me or not?

Thank you kind reader."
uacbgw,11,2022-04-23,Microsoft SWE internship as a 2nd year Maths student,Invisible-Discipline,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/uacbgw/microsoft_swe_internship_as_a_2nd_year_maths/,"I applied for a SWE internship at Microsoft (for summer 2023) earlier this month and recently received an invitation to a first round interview + codility test

The issue is that I'm a maths student, not a CS or SWE student, and I'm wondering how big of an issue that will be. I have coding experience (\~5 years of Python + C modules taken in university), but my course is mostly focused on raw mathematics, so I simply don't have the same experience or knowledge as someone who is in a course that is more laser-focused on a role like this.

Realistically, how much of a disadvantage am I at compared to a Computer Science student of the same age applying for the same role? Are there any people who were initially maths students and landed jobs in software development, how did you go about getting the position?

I've started doing easy+medium Leetcode questions in preparation for the codility test (absolutely no idea what to expect to see there), I can get through the easy questions with no problem. The medium questions sometimes require a bit (occasionally a lot) of Googling to get right which worries me, after doing some research on the specific problems it turns out that I need to use arcane algorithms which I've never heard of before. They make sense once I know of them and study them for a bit, but there's absolutely no way I would have randomly recreated the optimal algorithm in an interview situation. Is that what interviewers expect me to do?

This will be my first real-time interview and it's pretty nerve-racking, any comments or tips are much appreciated. Many thanks in advance &lt;3"

I posted on a different subreddit, but I see that this one is more active. I'm in state for UF, I live in south Florida and have family relatively nearby in Orlando. I toured the campus a bit once a few weeks ago, but I was really sick and sleep deprived, we also did not have a guided tour, nor did we see the entire campus or town of Gainesville so I am not really informed. I am sure though that it is very nice. Planning to go back up in a week or so to get a more informed decision and a better feel. For Virginia tech I got into the honors program and the engineering school and am intending to at either school, major in Computer Science or Computer Engineering with a heavy software/programming focus. I visited VT yesterday and I really liked it. At UF I would know a lot of people and at VT I would not really know anyone and at UF I would enjoy the fact that I would know a lot of studious people that I like. I know that each school is big, but I don't see myself being in a frat. I see on the rankings, even though I know that they don't mean much, that VT is like 10 spots ahead on average for engineering/cs for various sites, which does not mean much but UF is ranked much higher overall. I do know that employers look at the department, not the overall school though. Do any of you guys have knowledge of either engineering/cs program at either school along with clubs, research, internships, coops, and general knowledge about what each school is like? I also do not want financials to be part of my personal decision. Thank you."

One of them is with a defense contractor in SD. It is 26 an hour, my title would be mission engineer (though they are willing to let me put software engineer on my resume), and I will be programming in Lua. They also provide intern housing and my girlfriend is interning there too as a machine learning software engineer (she goes to UCSD, so it would be nice to spend 10 weeks together)

The other one is with a start in LA. They pay 30 an hour and I will be doing machine learning in Python probably. 

My main concern is that Lua is too niche for me as a starting point for my career. But if I take the one in LA I will loose money since I need to find my own housing and I won't get time to spend with my girlfriend. What would you guys choose?"

I work for a bank in the information security area.  I started about a year ago in a rotational analyst program. So far I've worked in PCI DSS and in Physical Security. I now have a choice to place permanently, or do another rotation. For the past few months I've been thinking about placing in PCI DSS, because I liked my time there and I was good at it. However now I'm starting to second guess it, since I'm not sure if I'd like it there long term; I really liked the people there, but the work itself is just ok. Currently I'm doing physical security support, which is basically intern work so I don't like it. Now I'm thinking about trying another rotation, but I only have one left so I need to choose wisely.

I majored in Cyber Security, but I never really clicked with that stuff. I liked coding a lot because I liked problem solving, but I've only done a small amount for actual work in my internship (I build some SQL script to generate a report). I have no idea where to go though. I have the option to stay in security or just go over to our normal tech department, where I could do any job. Having plenty of options is great but leaves me clueless and confused. I also want a good career potential and future, which I don't think PCI can give me.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? I know its not very specific, I just want to hear people's thoughts. Thanks guys!

The job description is pretty vague too:

Help build and deliver applications that keeps the world’s largest family owned winery running with leading edge technology

* Develop code for web and mobile applications
* Debug, test and troubleshoot code
* Work with various databases and systems
* Write technical documentation
* Develop system diagrams and workflows

I have been working at my job for about 4 years now and I am underpaid and overworked. I hate being asked to do OT, or having my boss call me and moving me to another post to cover that is half way across the city, or being asked to work on weekends. Ever since the pandemic I have been looking for remote jobs to do since I get to work where I am most comfortable. Hell, even if they did ask me to do over time I am at least in my own city or I don't have a boss saying that I need to go half way across town to cover something. The problem is I have been doing mostly blue collar jobs and a lot of these jobs need years of experience or a college degree to do. I also don't want to do any jobs relating to being on the phone. I would much rather do a typing type job like data entry or IT. Plus, the real benefit of working remotely is if I could get my work done quickly or if there is a slow day I could spend time on my leisure time or hobbies. 

My experience: Before doing security I worked as a unpaid intern at a computer repair shop. I would clean computers and hard drives, removed viruses, installed anti virus software, did Q and A over the phone. I did go to community college for 3 to 5 years but that was for a history degree or a general studies. I dropped out because I was not doing well in my classes. I can also type around 85 to 100 wpm and I do not MS office programs with the exception of Excel (though I could freshen up learning them from YouTube). 

I want to know is it possible to go from being a security guard to doing remote work or have you had a similar blue collar job and went remote?"

My project partner did absolutely no coding (nothing that was shared with me) and consistently made excuses about trying something to no avail. He contributed (somewhat) to his share of the other assignments but always at the last minute. I tend to want to get things done well before the deadline but understand that everyone has different working styles. But sharing credit for this project where he's done nothing has been really difficult for me to digest. I told him that I'm going to indicate the contribution as 70% for me and 30% for him and he started to protest saying that he'll do the last graded assignment we have left on his own (which is not nearly as much work as a whole project). I've addressed this with our teaching assistant and he basically washed his hands off the problem. He said I had to get my project partner to be okay with this contribution split. 

This person is a friend. We've talked about how unfair these types of situations are because HE was stuck in this very same situation last semester. There's so much I can say, there has been no end to all the bullshit excuses.

I know it happens all the time. Life is unfair. This semester has been so stressful because we're all trying to get internships as well. I've been told this happens all the time in the workplace too. I feel like I'm the one who needs to manage my expectations now? How do people deal with feeling of unfairness?"

It seems that I can't stick to a single program because I feel as if there isn't a high enough demand for what I am teaching myself. I started learning Python as my first programming language, after some time teaching myself it and doing research, I came to the conclusion that Python was not going to give me a good enough job. Now I understand that I may be wrong about that, but besides being a programming engineer, I did not see much use for this language. So I decided to switch and began learning web development (Html and CSS) which came to me pretty quickly. 

I began building pretty basic websites, and once I wanted to advance my skills, I understood that I needed to also learn JS and other languages (Node and all that good stuff). So I decided to do research and read subreddits to see people's experience with trying to make money with web development, but I have come to see that it is not worth it. The thing is, I already spent a considerable amount of time first learning Python, and after deciding to switch to Html and Css (which I spent lots of time learning), but from my own research, it seems that it is not easy to land a job because you have to have professional experience with web development or be a guru at it.

I have also learned that you can make websites for small businesses, but what I'm aiming for is an internship. I've tried to apply for an internship with my Html and Css skills and got past the first 2 interviews, but had no luck with landing an internship because my skills were not needed. I am now at the point of wondering if I should learn another language or if I should develop my web development skills. I just do not know what programming language I would need to learn to land an internship and begin developing skills. Should I go back to Python, stick with web development, and learn JS to improve my skills, or should I learn another language that would be more relevant to today's demands?"

I was accepted into both universities for mathematics but have recently taken interest upon the data science major instead. At Berkeley, I could easily declare data science as it is incorporated in the college of letters and science, but at irvine I would have to take 3 prerequisites to be able to switch, one of which(ics31) is nearly impossible for non cs majors to get into. With that being said Irvine also has specializations for their math major, with one being data science. My only worry with that is it not being enough preparation for a career in data science because of its heavy focus on mathematics and just brief learning of actual data science like computing and statistics. So that is the major situation, but also I really like how I could clear so many courses with my 12 AP classes at Irvine, that I wouldn’t be able to do at Berkeley. But also I figure the opportunities for internships and getting involved are great at Berkeley. Lastly, I loved the feel of the Irvine campus and I didn’t hate Berkeley, but the love there wasn’t the same. Just really in a predicament trying to think of which to choose, any input is appreciated!"

My current internship is looking to hire me Full-Time for 65k a year, we'll call this Job A. 

Job A is a start up, My current boss knows that I have another offer for 73k(Job B) which also provides Clearance but he said currently he can't match that. Right now Job B is clearly the better one, the only reason I am considering Job A is because my boss in order to persuade me to stay made some interesting points. He said Job A will have more growth and in potentially two years I could get to 100k+ salary. He said soon there will also be stock options. Job B is a typical government job and I can get to at best 85k in two years in my area. 

Job A I can grow more as a developer but does not have as much job security. 

Job B has job security but I am not sure how much I can grow there.

I can't seem to decide which option is better. I would appreciate any insight and your experiences. 

Also I don't know if I should consider each Job's 
benefits package (401k, insurance etc)


Edit: Thanks everyone for your responses, I still am not sure but I have gained a lot of knowledge for when I do make the decision. 

I generally do feel like I would learn more at the start up but the government position is the safer bet. I am early in my career and I should take risks now but I have taken upon certain responsibilities(helping parents) and if I put those into account I really need to have a safe job. I also want to learn more and in time have better offers. 

For now I think I am gonna try to learn more about more government position and maybe attempt to raise that 65k.

Edit 2: Gonna go with the Government job. Gonna let my boss tomorrow morning. Thanks everyone for the responses.

Although I learn various topics through school I don't have any real experience in cyber security, just some experience doing helpdesk IT work. I feel like I don't know enough. 

I passed the interview process which was some basic questions such as ""difference between white/black/grey hat hacker?"" or ""which port is HTTPS?"". I know this sounds kinda dumb but I'm not even 100% sure what a cyber security team does day to day. 

This job is at a bank and so I feel like there is this pressure to know what I am doing and I don't want to mess anything up. But don't get me wrong, I am extremely grateful I have this position and will take this as a learning opportunity for sure.

uaihbx,12,2022-04-23,App Season in Review: Switching Majors is Hard,Couch-Commander,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/uaihbx/app_season_in_review_switching_majors_is_hard/,"Tldr: Lower your expectations if you're trying to switch majors for a Master's (especially CS-related)

I've gotten a lot out of this sub, so I figured I'd give back a little and hopefully provide some insight from my experiences this past cycle (also venting a bit).

Profile, so y'all know what I was working with:

* UG: Georgia Tech (ChemE, CS minor)
* GPA: &gt;3.9
* GRE: 335
* Research: 3 years, 3 pubs in engineering journals applying computation (neural networks, convex optimization)
* Work experience: 2 internships, 1 general engineering, 1 data analyst at a F100, also 1 upcoming data/BI engineer at FAANG
* Extracurriculars: a few awards for data-related projects, president of a data-oriented club
* LORs: All 3 writers were very positive in meetings going over notes (2 were research profs, 1 was prior internship advisor)
* SOP: worked with a lot of resources from WriteIvy. Got it reviewed by multiple advisors and they said it was unique, efficient, and convincing
* Application timeline: made sure to get each one in \~2 weeks before the deadline (since many programs read apps in the order they receive them)

Applications (all Master's programs, 6/7 industry-oriented):

* Stanford Computational &amp; Math Eng: Reject
* Harvard Computational Science &amp; Eng : Reject
* MIT Computational Science &amp; Eng: Reject
* MIT Master of Business Analytics: Interview, Reject
* Berkeley MEng EECS: Reject, admit to 2nd major
* CMU Computational Data Science: admit, no aid
* Georgia Tech Computational Science &amp; Eng: admit

Because CMU offered no aid, cost of attendance came out to \~100k while GT was \~40k (not to mention opportunity cost of the CMU program being longer). With similar career outcomes, I could not justify going to CMU and chose GT.

While GT is a great school, the season was a disappointment for me. Being an undergrad there with a GPA over 3.7 and any research connections pretty much guarantees admission to most of their MS programs. Frankly, knowing you could have tried way less and gotten the same results sucks.

Trying to ID what happened, I had excelled in every CS and Math class I took, but I didn't have a lot of the senior/grad-level courses that applicants majoring in these subjects would have taken. I met every qualification posted on websites, dug through curriculums and made sure I hit all the equivalent pre-reqs for each course I'd take, but the most obvious answer seems to be that top programs aren't as accepting of major-switchers as they may claim. It probably doesn't help that I'm another male ORM applying to CS-oriented programs.

So yeah, if you're trying to switch majors, even if everyone says you're gold in every other aspect, you may want to curtail your expectations."

I really like the social aspects of being in university like easily being able to make friends, going to parties, being a part of clubs and sororities, having an endless source of mentally stimulating convos, and just being surrounded by a bunch of really smart and talented professors. I think i’ll really miss having access to them when I graduate but I’m also really burnt out from the workload and stress. 

I’ve heard the social aspects of university basically disappear after you graduate and I was wondering if there was any truth to that for the cs majors here. I was wondering for all the FAANG(or adjacent) interns who got new grad offers and are making ~$200k: 

1. Do you think you have a good balance of all the elements in your life that are important to you?

2. Do you feel happier now that you’ve graduated? 

3. Does the amount of money you make influence any aspects of your life? (Basically do you think your high salary matters?) 

4. What does socializing look like for you now? 

5. Is there anything you regret not doing while you were an undergrad?

6. Were there any decisions you made as an undergrad that still positively or negatively affect you?  


I’m really just trying to get some insights cuz i lowkey feel really lost right now and I noticed people just sort of disappear in these types of subs after getting a FAANG new grad job. Thanks in advance for your responses!"

I am a 23-year-old Italian guy who has been studying self-taught since September to become a programmer (I like the front-end, but in the future, I would like to do more).

In February, after following the program proposed by The Odin Project (without having done the Nodejs section), I did an internship as a front-end programmer. During the internship, I used a lot of CSS / HTML but hardly ever touched js (much to my chagrin). On May 1st I will finish my internship and I had intentions to study Js + React and then look for another internship where I can use them. My plan was to dedicate 3/4 months full focus to study and focusing on the realization of personal projects to put in my curriculum.

You suggest continuing TOP with the Node section, or deepening JS and React (perhaps with the paths proposed on frontendMaster) I'm not very satisfied with my knowledge of JS / React and for a frontend position Nodejs at the moment seems to me like overkill. What do you guys suggest?

I had a very horrid experience just recently (now graduated): I was asked to implement some compute shaders for work. (Compute shaders are essentially small programs that run on the GPU for non-CS engineers) During college I took a semester course in optimizing programs for a specific hardware architecture, in it we designed various expensive matrix operations specifically for the architecture of the device given. First this was writing really hacky assembly by optimizing the code for the specific use case and later the exact same trick only in CUDA. I and the person I worked with did a great job at this, and got rewarded no less than a 90% grade. I felt like I learned quite a lot here.

Then college continued. Robotics, thermodynamics, functional programming and image processing ensued. These all being courses notorious for taking a lot of work and effort to chew through. After that I needed to do a master thesis and an internship. Fast forward and I'm sitting behind a desk at work. I remember *almost nothing* from my experience during the course. I blame this on just being constantly overloaded by different poorly connected topics. My brain just isn't allowed to take in what we learned, it is put in a perpetual state of having to learn more without being rewarded for retaining any of it. I'm looking at the CUDA documentation and GPU specifics and I recognize the topics again, but lost almost all knowledge of how we tackled things like pipelining issues, memory partitioning to favor warp access, hell - even what data we put in registers and the regular GPU memory. It's awful and just feels so bad. This is the first time I actually felt like I just wasted my time studying."

So.. its a warm Sunday morning , you lie in your bed thinking what went wrong , let me guess you were a small town , above average kid who had promise in school ,maybe even became a city topper or something .

Your parents expect you to become an engineer or doctor, so they enroll you in some random coaching class , nothing top notch . You being a thoughtless idiot grind for 2 years like you have your whole life coz , hey .. you have no friends , or hobbies , girlfriend nothing .  

Well boom you clear JEE advance with a an average rank . Your parents enroll you into a second rate IIT  (again average) , but hey you have CSE .From the get go you indulge in movies games , and every indulgence you find ,except for well , good grades , coding (WHICH YOU'VE NEVER DONE IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE) . 

Then COVID comes along and you go home , back to where it started , you keep fiddling around , getting below average grades , avoiding contact from your friends , trying to forget this whole ordeal  , running away from life , f\*pping till you are tired . 

Then comes the end of third year where you are full of backlogs , design credits , loneliness , crippling depression , anxiety about facing your peers , your parents who once believed in you    

all your peers have wonderful internships , PPOS , girlfriends , direction in life , a basic sense of purpose .Everyone used their 2 years of lockdown being productive , while you were scared even to change your life a bit.

you have nothing . Maybe ADHD all along , maybe not but you sure are messed in the head , because IITians are successful right ? but you aren't , you copy you cheat you leech off of everyone around you , maybe that's why everyone leaves you  

Now after years of grinding endlessly you are just a fine mockery on the whole topper stereotype . Cynical &amp; depressed

I need someone to please calm me down. I'm on antipsychotics for months for a possible diagnosis of bipolar (before that I've been on various types of antidepressants and benzodiazepines). I've been on a depressive episode since february, it's been hell on earth. I stopped college, my internship, I put it all on stand by, thinking ""Imma quickly fix this and I'll be back"" but I'm not getting better, it's suffocating how much everything hurts. I'm so tired of being tired and sad. My hope for the future (even the close future) is almost non existing.

Everyday there's less and less things keeping me from ending it all, since I no longer believe I will ever be content with my life. The only thing keeping me alive is my boyfriend (for whom I became quite dependent during this difficult time) and the pain I would cause to my family.

I don't have the courage to admit to anyone that I'm having suicidal idealizations again, that's why I'm asking here for a word of confort. I don't want to die, I just don't want to be in pain anymore, please help me."

I have very very minimal interview experiences (for my internships) and at that, time I only asked about some feedback, the culture inside and how work usually goes by the day. What else would be good but safe, non-aggressive questions to know more if it is good or not?

Basically, do you know any question that you recommend to ask the interviewers?

If experience level and industry matters to this question, I'm aiming for entry level roles in the IT/software industry. Currently I am undergrad.

This is my first post. I am an international student &amp; currently in a high school. Recently, I got admitted to all three campuses of UOFT but I am not able to choose between UOFT St. George &amp; UTSC. I am interested to major in Computer Science. I don't have any specific preferences. Also, as of now, I don't have any intention of PR and citizenship, I just want to work for 3-4 years after graduation to pay back my education loan. Can someone point out the merits &amp; demerits of both over the other and help me decide a campus? BTW if you could answer the following, it would be very helpful:-

1. What are the significant differences between UOFT St. George's PEY and ASIP (Arts &amp; Science Internship Program) like salary, affect on 4 year graduation, time duration? Which is better?
2. Is there any significant difference in St. George's PEY (Professional Experience year) &amp; UTSC's CS Co-op in terms of salary, affect on 4 year graduation, time duration? Which is better?
3. Does PEY or UTSC co-op or ASIP increase your graduation time from 4 year to 5 years?

I need to decide by the end of this month, so please help with your valuable advice as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance!"

First post but figured I’d reach out to the community for some advice.

I work in retail banking at one of the big five banks.

I’ve been in my role as an intern for almost 9 months now and my graduation from my program is coming up. I currently take home 45k. 

When the program graduation happens a bump in pay is given. It’s only about 1-4K on salary.

I’ve recently been head hunted on linked in for a similar role at another fi.

55k starting.

I’ve built a great relationship with my team and my managers rock. However it’s hard to justify staying if another fi wants to pay me 22% more plus an additional week of vacation. I’d have to learn their systems from scratch and build new relationships. 

I really want to stay at my current employer and would like to use this offer to leverage my current salary and situation.

What would be the best way to approach this situation with my boss when positioning a competitive offer? 

This is also a time sensitive situation in which my other employer would like my to start mid may.

My coding skills flat out suck and it's giving me a lot of anxiety. I don't have anything of value to show in terms of a personal portfolio / resume.

Am I better off spending this summer interning or busting my ass learning DSA and and building a portfolio with a couple legit projects?

Some considerations:

\- The internship would likely be at a startup that works with blockchain tech

\- I am worried that since my skills are so low, I won't be able to get much out of the internship and will be entering the fall semester only marginally better off than I am now

\- I live in the NY area and my goal is to do the big tech thing for at least a couple years -- that being said, what would be more likely to help me achieve this goal?

Any insight is much appreciated"
ub0ryh,2,2022-04-24,Graduated with my BA in Geography 6 years ago and haven't done anything with it since. About to start a Graduate certificate program at Utah State. What advice can you give me to help launch my career?,cyanide_girl,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/ub0ryh/graduated_with_my_ba_in_geography_6_years_ago_and/,"Honestly, I'm just really nervous. I feel like I missed my chance not going into my field right away. I'm glad I'm doing this program, but I've been working service industry for the last 6 years and have concerns about entering into the professional world.

Any words of advice from fellow GIS professionals? Is an internship the best way to gain experience to get a job? Do employers really mean it when they say an entry level position requires two to three years of experience?

Any advice or words of encouragement you can give is greatly appreciated! Thank you :)"

ub2lpp,38,2022-04-24,Should I stay an extra year for my Master’s or should I go for a job with my Bachelor’s and go back for a Master’s later?,OddAtmosphere6303,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ub2lpp/should_i_stay_an_extra_year_for_my_masters_or/,"My school offers a program for EE where you can take graduate-level courses for your electives, and they will count for credit towards your Bachelor’s and Master’s degree simultaneously, allowing you to get a Master’s in EE with only one more year of school, and there’s no grad school application. 

I’m stuck on whether I should stick to undergrad electives and get into a job asap, or if I should hold out and get my Master’s before going into the industry. 

If I get my Master’s later in life I will have to reapply to school, and it will take at least two years to complete, but I can (hopefully) land a real job much sooner. If I stay in school now, I will have to rely on summer internship money, and grad student lab instructor job during the school year. 

What are your thoughts?"
ub2n0h,2,2022-04-24,Bachelor's,InboxIzzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ub2n0h/bachelors/,"I am currently a BS student think of switching to BA because I will be able to graduate earlier.

 The only way to graduate with a BS within the same time frame of a BA would mean I would have to take 4 classes this summer, 2 during winter break, 5 in fall and 5 next spring or 4+ internships if I land an internship for fall and spring. I have no idea how hard it would be to juggle an internship plus 15 credits a semester and not having any breaks for the next year.  I also plan on taking 3 masters courses over this year in order to finish a masters degree quicker if I choose to do that after getting a job. 

SO my question is if you get a BA do you have to put BA in your education section of your resume or can you just but Bachelor's of computer science instead of specifying if it's a BA or BS? 

Because from what I have herd at the end of the day it doesn't matter all that much if you are a BA or BS student as long as you are good at whatever job you go for. 

Also are there any drawbacks for most people who got a BA? Do you wish you would have gotten a BS instead?"
ub2n9r,54,2022-04-24,Looking for an EE job as someone in their mid 30s,rivyro,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/ub2n9r/looking_for_an_ee_job_as_someone_in_their_mid_30s/,"13 years ago I graduated with a BS in EE. Immediately after college I was hired as a programmer to test and develop software for medical imaging equipment. I enjoyed the work but the pay wasn't very good so I left 5 months later and accepted a higher paying, but non-technical job at a marketing firm.


I've decided I want to get back into the field, but I've forgotten everything about EE including math and coding. I'm concerned employers will favor recent grads over someone like me because my resume doesn't look good. Should I even bother listing my internships or my 1st job?"

ub4knc,9,2022-04-24,Backend engineer open to mentoring people,cssegfault,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ub4knc/backend_engineer_open_to_mentoring_people/,"I have made this post in thanks to u/punchedchuck34 
post to break the ice. 

I only have a computer engineering degree but  have 6 years of developer experience (1 year from internship). Worked at both a small and large dev teams. Experience includes Koitlin, Java, c++/c, python (quite weak on front end stuff) 

I have dipped my toes in a lot of topics, though not all are professional experience, so I can offer some general career advice ( for students) and guidance.

 However, I would ask if you are a professional then to consider visiting cscareerquestions instead. Though be mindful of the armchair folks sometime.

Open a chat with me, dm or what not and I'll be sure to respond. I'm even open to do some exercises and a mock run of what a developer day looks like. We can struggle together on leet code and/or google new concepts. Let's do a dry run on git (I know this can be tough for newcomers despite the tutorials online). 

I will NOT be answering your hw questions.

I'm a computer science student. I've been straight A's since freshman year and have taken an adequate amount of aps and honors classes as necessary. I'm pretty skilled in programming and engineering and such, and I've done 3 internships at companies on top of multiple projects with professors. I'm mostly good in the extracurricular side of things, but the one thing I really lack is awards. I don't really have many awards in CS. I've done USACO, and have gotten to gold. I've looked into doing topcoder and codeforces and will likely be doing them this summer. However, I don't think those are enough to bolster my resume on the awards section. I don't do fbla or deca or debate simply because I find those extremely boring, but that's where a lot of people seem to get their awards. I was wondering if there were any competitions or things I could do to recieve more awards and validation for my work. Thanks"
ub81ii,98,2022-04-24,I hate how stressed i am. i just wanna go to my 50% acceptance state college man.,axacrity,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ub81ii/i_hate_how_stressed_i_am_i_just_wanna_go_to_my_50/,"I have so much anxiety about getting rejected even though i logically don’t think i will. it’s not super prestigious or fancy but it’s perfect for me, and i’m really not sure what i’ll do if i don’t get in. 

 i have a 3.93 UW 4.46 W, in all the national honor societies, taking 14 AP classes by senior year and so far i’ve gotten A’s in all of them, i’m getting an internship with the national security agency, part of our school’s student-led community service club for 3 years and hoping to become a leader next year, legacy, feel very confident in what will be my essay. 

I’m hung up on my SAT and LORs though. i’m not super close with my teachers, and my SAT reading score is literally a hundred points better than math. as a girl who wants to try going into comp sci, it freaks me out. i have a ~1360 average. 

i feel like i would be accepted if i applied for anything OTHER than comp sci. the SAT range is 1270-1480 and the comp sci major is VERY competitive. i am not super passionate about computer science anyway, but it’s the only thing i can see myself doing for the rest of my life that will actually make me money. i don’t know if i should just apply for something else at this point… i feel like i would LOVE to do something like a vfx/film animation/immersive media design major, but in my state i doubt i’d have any good job opportunities and i’d be wasting me and my parents’ money. 

i think i just needed to rant. i hate how much stress there is in america to get into a good college and figure out your life when you’re still a baby and go tens of thousands of dollars in debt just to get a job you don’t even like to even be able to live, meanwhile my dad gets 6 figures for barely scraping by. i know im not the only one going through this but god, it sucks."

If I went to another university and did everything that Waterloo students do to get co-ops, ex.

Are higher-end internships like FAANG in particular much more accessible to Waterloo students than those of a similar calibre elsewhere?"

***We are looking for contributors like you!*** **Please contact the moderators of** r/I_A **if you are interested or directly submit your article to the sub.** 

***Thank you.***

List of good ideas rcvd so far. 

* 1	Sources of income as a 1st year student / Sources of income in any year of undergraduation please.
* 2	How to search for internships? (Field specific advice)
* 3	How dependency on colleges is decreasing when it comes to computer science.
* 4	design education in india
* 5	Research output in India and how it relates to entrance examinations and the auxillary systems (like coaching classes).
* 6	How to excel in Indian law schools
* 7	Off the beaten path subjects like Materials Science , good colleges for this, scope of field
* 8	Mathematics and computing branch in Engineering and science.
* 9	Good Institutes in India for Linguistics, Archeology, etc. ie, courses not many people take, and job opportunities in India and Abroad
* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)
* 16	Sports Data Analytics
* 17	Masters abroad (preferably from people who have completed their masters abroad)
* 18	does anybody know how to take good notes? From a textbook and during a class/lecture....
* 19	Undergrad overseas or foreign universities and Hybrid courses (Few Semesters in India/ and Few abroad)
* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.
* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids
* 24	Alternatives to medical for PCB kids
* 25	Stuff/programmes to do in India as a gap year student
* 26	MSc in quant Econ Vs MBA in terms of ROI, job opportunity etc
* 27	MBBS from foreign country
* 28	How to prepare for SAT
* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios
* 36	BCA vs B.Sc (Computer Science) vs B. Sc (Information Technology) vs B. Tech (Computer Science Engineering)
* 37	Which engineering branch is right for you? This is so that people don't blindly run after cse and actually choose the branch they would enjoy and can excel in it
* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!
* 43	The unequal relationship between Profs and students with no safety net for students

Prospective student looking at UTD! I was just wondering what it’s like studying computer science here. Am applying to UT Austin but it’s very competitive there and A&amp;M has the ETAM that I don’t want to do. So just wondering about the campus. Compared to A&amp;M, what’s the student life like here? I know it’s not as good since there’s no football team but honestly don’t care that much about football. Also are there internship opportunities? And if so, are they good? And finally could I get a job in Austin after graduating here? I know these might sound like dumb questions but I live in a very small town and have never coded but just really want to learn and major in it. Thanks!!!"
ubaqdx,10,2022-04-24,How am I supposed to get a job in the field after self-teaching myself within my own scope?,UglyStru,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ubaqdx/how_am_i_supposed_to_get_a_job_in_the_field_after/,"There are plenty of free resources online to learn certain programming languages, technologies, platforms, whatever you want to call it. The problem with most of these is that they just teach you how to write certain algorithms or sequences, not necessarily how to build a utility that would impress an employer.

So I can sit there and write my own little programs that beginners do, or to do little things that may fall within my own scope, but how do I expand from there without actually having a job? How do I learn things like working with a team with version control, or how all of the stacks interact within a company's software? Universities remedy this by placing you in internships or throwing you into group projects, but I can't really do that on my own. My fear is going into an interview after feeling confident with a certain plethora of knowledge under my belt, showing off my work, but then getting the question ""Well, how would that benefit our company?"". For example, I bought a Java textbook which teaches some neat algorithms, and how to make some little utilities that can operate a vending machine or something like that. But that will not translate well to landing a role at a company.

For people that self taught themselves into a software engineering role, how did you do it? How did you get the knowledge and experience to land you a role in your company? Any help or discussion would be appreciated."

For context, I am a 2nd year (out of 5, doing a 5-year M.Sc program) CS student that is also working part time at ~25%, and I will also be working full time over the summer. The company and project I am on are okay and will look great on my resume, but for next summer I am looking to find something that's more interesting. I am aiming for an internship at FAANG or some other well known tech company at a similar level.

From what I've heard from friends, most local companies here are very interested in the projects you do in your free time, and frequently ask about these during interviews. From this subreddit however, I've gotten the impression that the top tier companies rarely care about these kinds of things unless they're very impressive? 

I prefer spending time doing CP problems as I find these fun and rewarding, but I also feel like that is very hard to leverage in your favor whilst job hunting as opposed to personal projects. It feels way easier to stand out from other applicants if you can actually show something you've built, as opposed to just mentioning ""Yeah I spend some time here and there solving algorithmic problems."" I have a few small projects on my GitHub which have gotten me interviews in the past but nothing too impressive. 

**TL;DR What do you guys think is the most efficient way for me to spend my time, grinding leetcode or filling out my github page?**

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!"

I have recently got a internship at one huge company and after 3 months if I will be good they can offer me a junior position.

Want to grow here and become a value member which will bring something rly good at company.  
So already passed like 2 months and one week and I get notice that I always have that impostor feeling behind me. Like I do not do so much. I don't know a lot of yet even if learning still. And feeling sometimes when I do not know what to do. For example: I got task from lead, do research and than get that I just do not know what to do next. And when I write to lead and ask help - he came to me only after 2-3 hours. I know, we are all busy, but I felt at that time totally lost with no way to go or to do. And I'm just sitting and trying to do smt, but when lead came to me, he do it so fast - on what I have spent 3 hours he spent only 10 mins.  
So I wanna ask some advices for what to do if felt struggling. Will be glad to hear any advices and just some similar stories and how you are feeling and how to go through it."

To NUSC offerees, congrats!

Here's an overview of the pros &amp; cons of NUSC and stuff I recommend you consider when deciding to accept/reject your NUSC offer.

To be clear, I'm not some disheartened USP/Yale-NUS College (YNC) student/alumni who's trying to convince you to stay away from NUSC. I'm also not an NUSC marketing representative trying to sell you the college.

While the unhappiness of some in the USP &amp; YNC communities is valid and I have nothing against NUSC's marketing team, I'll try my best to be neutral and present all sides.

I've also cited sources to back up my points and checked that everything here's accurate. However, I'm an imperfect human. If I made any errors, please point it out in the comments and I'll edit my post!

Importantly, **you can accept your offer to your NUS course while rejecting your NUSC offer.** In other words, you can still go to the NUS major you were admitted to even if you're no longer interested in NUSC. (Source: this [26 Feb post](https://nuscollege2021.wixsite.com/nuscollege/forum/admissions/enrolment-process) and this [7 Mar post](https://nuscollege2021.wixsite.com/nuscollege/forum/others/nus-college) on the NUSC Open House 2022 forum)

I hope this will help yall make a more informed decision on where you'll end up for your next 4 years!

# Cost

Sadly, money matters and university education can be expensive. **NUS College may make your uni education even more expensive.**

All NUS students, will need to pay [tuition fees](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/administrative-policies-procedures/undergraduate/undergraduate-fees), which will be around $8-9k for most NUSC majors and almost $13k for Law (for Singaporeans), and more for PRs &amp; International Students.

There are **two main additional fees** you'll need to pay as an NUSC student:

1. Residential fees: According to [NUS OSA website](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-services/hostel-admission/undergraduate/hostel-meal-plan-rates), the cost *each semester* will be around $2.5-3k (for hostel) + around $850-1,000 (for meal plans). Meal plans are *compulsory*. Additionally, residential fees **increase every academic year**. In total, this can be **an extra $13.5-17k** for the 2 years you are *required* to stay on campus.
2. Overseas costs: NUSC has a [global experience requirement](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/learn/global-pathways/), requiring you to go overseas for at least 6 mths. One great thing about NUS Student Exchange Programmes (SEPs) is that you continue to pay NUS tuition fees and you don't need to pay the other uni's tuition fees! But **there are many other things you must pay for yourself, like airfare, accommodation, and insurance** (Source: [NUS GRO](https://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/global-programmes/student-exchange/outgoing-exchangers).

NUS does offer financial aid, but they have strict income requirements and some are repayable loans. Unlike Yale-NUS, NUS doesn't promise to cover all demonstrated need. (Source: [The Octant, Sep 2021](https://theoctant.org/edition/issue/allposts/opinion/the-new-college-fantastic-hopes-and-how-it-probably-cant-achieve-them/))

If you need financial aid, check out [NUS OAM on financial aid](https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/financial-aid/overview-eligibility-for-full-time-undergraduates), [NUS GRO on financing](https://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/financing/), and [NOC Awards &amp; Scholarships](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/apply/awards-and-scholarships/). See how much aid you qualify for, and check if it's enough.

I'm sure for some of you, the extra fees are worth it for the extra opportunities that NUSC offers. After all, this isn't money just going down the drain, you are getting extra stuff in return for the extra cost.

Or maybe you have a scholarship that reduces/eliminates this cost! (Congrats on getting your scholarship!)

On the other hand, for others, the extra cost may be quite a significant burden, not worth the extra stuff NUSC brings, and/or NUS's fin aid may be insufficient.

Please discuss these costs with whoever is sponsoring your education (e.g. your parents).

# Curriculum

The NUS College Curriculum will replace:

* All of your General Education (University-wide) requirements
* All/most of your college/faculty/school's Common Curriculum
* Some of your Unrestricted Electives (UE) space

(Sources: [NUSC Learn Overview](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/learn/) and [NUSC FAQ](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/faq/), 2nd qn under ""Majors and Curriculum"")

The NUSC Curriculum spans a wide range of subjects, from Data Science to the Humanities.

**However, I'd advice against joining NUS College just to have access the content/subjects taught in the Foundational NUSC mods.**

There are other ways you can access these topics:

* All students (except those in Law) must take mods on Data &amp; Digital Literacy as part of General Education (Source: [NUS Registrar's Office](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/general-education/for-students-admitted-from-AY2021-22)). Those in Law must take mods in Quantitative Reasoning and Law &amp; Technology (Source: [NUS Law YouTube](https://youtu.be/XJIlZppNKP8?t=101)).
* All NUSC majors except Law already have required Writing module(s)
* [CHS Common Curriculum](https://chs.nus.edu.sg/programmes/common-curriculum/) has mods on Integrated Humanities, Social Sciences, and Science. Students in SoC can also take these mods as part of the new [SoC Common Curriculum](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/soc-22-23/#appendix-b-interdisciplinary-id-modules).
* If you want to explore subjects beyond your major, you can always reading modules from other subjects via your UEs (Source: [NUS Registrar's Office](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/curriculum-structure)).

Also, for some programmes like Law and PPE, you will have modified NUSC requirements (Source: [NUSC FAQ](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/faq/), 7th qn under ""Majors and Curriculum"").

This can be both a good and bad thing. On one hand, it helps make your workload more manageable. On the other hand, it means that you will be taking less NUSC modules, so you might not get to take some of the NUSC modules that you want to take.

*Side note: Perhaps the main exception to the above would be for Law majors. For Law students, you can read up to 12MCs (typically equal to three modules) of non-Law mods w/o getting prior approval. You will need approval if you want to read &gt;12MCs non-Law mods. (Source:* [*NUS Law website*](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/llb_prog/non_law_subjects.html)*)*

*However, with NUS College, you'll likely be able to read more than 12MCs of non-Law, NUSC mods.*

*There are also other opportunities for Law students to read more than 12MCs of non-Law mods (see the ""Other Special Programmes"" section for more info).*

What you should join NUSC for is the **small group seminar-style of NUSC mods**. The small class sizes allows there to be more lively class discussion and makes lessons more interactive.

It's a great opportunity to learn how to better express yourself, build a closer relationship with your profs &amp; peers, and to hear different perspectives.

If you are introverted/shy, I'm sure there are other such students who've still had a great time in Yale-NUS, USP, and other places with small class sizes.

However, **you should be willing to take advantage of this kind of classroom.** If you just want to go to class and be spoonfed, then NUSC isn't for you.

You must be willing to step out of your comfort zone, speak up in class, be engaged in classroom discussions, and listen to and learn from your peers.

Here are some alternatives which also have small class sizes (non-exhaustive list):

* SMU has 100% small seminar-style classes (Source: [SMU Admissions](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/why-smu/interactive-pedagogy)), unlike NUSC, where you'll take most (around two-thirds) of your modules in NUS and most of those will be in big lectures. However, NUS offers a wider variety of subjects compared to SMU. Some subjects (mainly the Humanities, Science, and Engineering) are offered in NUS but not SMU.
* NUS other Residential Colleges (Tembusu, CAPT, RC4, and RVRC) also offer small-group teaching (Source: [NUS OSA](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/campus-living/residential-options/residential-colleges)). Unlike NUSC, these RCs are also open to students from all majors (including stuff like Medicine and Architecture). However, you'll only take 4 mods (or less for certain majors like Law) in these RCs, compared to NUSC's 14 modules.

Also, **NUSC will reduce the no. of UEs you have**. What are UEs for? Well, there are various things you can do with your UEs:

* Greater depth in your Major subject, which can help if you want to pursue postgrad studies (Source: [NUS CHS Sharing Session, Dec 2019](https://youtu.be/iHKmNvS7MAk?t=3751))
* Specialisation(s), 2nd major, and/or minor(s) (Source: [NUS Registrar's Office](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/curriculum-structure))
* Explore topics from a variety of different subjects, which can help if you have interests beyond your major
* Learn languages like Korean at the [Centre for Language Studies](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cls/)

**While you will still have some UE space, the reduced number of UEs means that it may be harder for you to pursue the stuff listed above, or you might need to overload (i.e. take a higher workload) to pursue the stuff above.**

Note that if you pursue a double degree programme (DDP), you will have *zero* UE space (source: [NUS RO](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/special-programmes/double-degree-programmes/double-degree-programme-framework-and-guidelines#requirements)). So, you will need to overload more on top of your already heavy DDP workload.

# Academic Rigour

NUSC mods are likely going to be much harder than the General Education and Common Curriculum modules they replace.

This has been pointed out by other Redditors in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/t1s67j/is_nus_college_worth_applying_to_what_are_the/) in r/NUS. And it makes sense. After all, NUS College is supposed to be an honours college for some of the most high performing undergraduates in NUS.

To be clear, academic rigour and difficulty isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, you are going to university to learn new stuff and to stretch yourself. You can't grow much in university if you never deal with any challenges.

However, **university will likely be very different from your pre-uni school life.** You have significantly more freedom and way more independence in uni, as pointed out by a student during the [CHS e-Open House 2022 Student Panel](https://youtu.be/TjV5iodG8fA?t=2231).

**You'll need to be self-driven and have good time management skills.**  Just because you were able to cope and perform well academically in pre-U doesn't necessarily mean the same will apply when you get into uni.

# Changing Majors in NUSC

Maybe you aren't sure what you want to study in uni, or you later discover some subject you previously didn't know much about and realise it's great for you.

One great thing about NUS College is that it allows you to switch to most other majors within your first four semesters (Source: [NUS College FAQ](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/faq/), 9th qn under ""Majors and Curriculum"").

However, note that there a few limitations to this:

* Some majors, such as Medicine, Architecture, and Industrial Design, are not compatible with NUS College (Source: [NUS College FAQ](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/faq/), 1st question under ""Majors and Curriculum"").
* Three majors compatible with NUS College (Pharm Sci, PPE, and Law) require you to pass a separate selection process (Source: [NUS College website](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Applying-to-NUS-College-Majors.pdf)).
* If you don't meet the subject prerequisites for the major you want to transfer to, you'll need to take bridging modules, and thus potentially push the start of taking your major modules one semester late.

Also, I should note that some majors have a lot of major requirements, so **it'll be hard to squeeze all your major requirements into your last few semesters in NUS if you change your major later**

YNC (which also allowed students to finalise their major later) was designed such that you begin taking major modules only in Year 3 (Source: [Yale-NUS website](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/academics/overview/academic-experience/)).

However, I believe most if not all NUS majors are designed such that you start taking major modules from your first sem.

As far as I know, all majors require at least 60MCs (approx. 15 modules), but some require much more. For e.g.,

|Major|Major requirements|Source|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Computing Majors (except Computer Engineering)|80-84MCs (approx 20-21 modules)|[My earlier post on the updated SoC curriculum](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/t02p28/uni_updated_nus_cs_curriculum/)|
|Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE)|100MCs (approx. 25 modules)|[CHS PPE website](https://chs.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ppe/), see ""Curriculum Structure"" tab|
|Data Science and Economics (DSE)|96MCs (approx. 24 modules)|[CHS DSE website](https://chs.nus.edu.sg/programmes/dse/), see ""Graduation"" tab|
|Environmental Studies|92MCs (approx. 23 modules)|[CHS BES website](https://chs.nus.edu.sg/programmes/bes/), see ""Graduation"" tab|
|Business Admin|90MCs (approx. 22.5 modules)|[NUS BBA website](https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-programme/curriculum-ay2021-2022-onwards/), see ""Programme Requirements"" tab|
|Accountancy and Real Estate|108MCs (approx. 27 modules)|[NUS BBA website](https://bba.nus.edu.sg/academic-programmes/bba-accountancy-programme/bbaacc-curriculum-ay2021-2022-onward/), see ""Programme Requirements"" tab; and [NUS BSc Real Estate Curriculum website](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/real-estate/bsc/curriculum/), see ""Curriculum Structure (Cohort 2021 onwards)"" tab|

The above doesn't even include any potential bridging modules and other degree requirements outside of your major requirements!

For reference, the average NUS workload is 20MCs or 5 mods per sem. As you can see, some of these major requirements are basically equivalent to or exceed the workload of *four* (or even *five*) semesters.

So, while you can theoretically change your major over your first 4 semesters, in practice it might be harder for some majors esp. if you the change later on. **If you change your major late, you will probably need to plan the modules you take each sem carefully, have less flexibility to explore in upper years, and potentially need to overload.**

Anyways, even if you are not an NUSC student, you can still apply to transfer to a different major within NUS, but you'll need to submit another application to NUS OAM and your transfer application may or may not be approved (Source: [NUS OAM website](https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/transfer-applicants)).

# Being the inagural batch

&gt;I want to just totally acknowledge that this first year, it's going to be messy. It's going to be strange and new. And so one of the things I will say is: if you like everything to be totally mapped out, ... maybe this is not a journey that you want to be a part of.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Prof Eleanor Wong, NUS College Vice-Dean (Residential Programmes &amp; Enrichment) (Source: [NUS College Open House 2022 FB Video](https://www.facebook.com/104442898732258/videos/7053520874689257), starts around the 45:09)

Being part of NUSC's inagural batch (or for those serving NS, one of the first few batches) comes with its own pros and cons.

As Prof El mentioned, it's going to be messy.

NUS is probably still figuring some stuff out. There are going to be teething issues. NUS may have failed to consider some edge cases, or find out some problems only when they start implementing stuff. Stuff may change and become different from what's been reflected in publicity materials.

The process to create NUS College has been rushed. The USP's predecessors started four years before USP started, and Yale-NUS Common Curriculum took years to be planned (Source: [The Octant, 28 Sept 2021](https://theoctant.org/edition/issue/allposts/opinion/the-new-college-fantastic-hopes-and-how-it-probably-cant-achieve-them/)).

On the other hand, the process for developing NUSC appears to be extremely tight:

* The earliest date I can find where planning for NUS College started was **late Jun 2021**, which is when NUS consulted with the Board of Trustees Chair and MOE about the proposal (Source: [New College FAQ PDF on Yale-NUS website](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-0920-New-College-FAQs.pdf))
* The formation of NUS College &amp; transition plans were only endorsed by the NUS Board of Trustees and the Yale-NUS Governing Board in **Aug 2021** (Source: [New College FAQ PDF on Yale-NUS website](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-0920-New-College-FAQs.pdf))
* The Planning Committee and Working Groups had their first meetings on **21 Sep 2021** (Source: [NUSC Blog, 23 Sep 2021](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/blog/meet-the-planning-committee/) and [The Octant, 30 Oct 2021](https://theoctant.org/edition/issue/allposts/news/red-tape-or-confidentiality-restrictions-surround-information-sharing-student-engagement-for-new-college-working-groups/))
* NUS first publicly anounced details (including curriculum structure) on NUS College (then called ""New College"") on **18 Dec 2021** (Source: [IG post by NUS Admissions, 4 Dec 2021](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXBuFvwhRsn/))
* NUS College will take in its 1st batch of students on **1 Aug 2022** (Source: [NUS AY2022/23 Academic Calendar](http://nus.edu.sg/registrar/docs/info/calendar/ay2022-2023.pdf))

In other words, there is **less than a year** between the date the college was approved and its inagural intake, and the Planning Committee &amp; Working Groups had **less than 3 months** (from 21 Sep to 18 Dec 2021) to prepare the curriculum structure and other details on NUSC before the 1st public info session.

To be fair, here's NUS's explanation for why they believe the NUSC curriculum can be developed in less than one year. I will let you decide if you're persuaded by them.

&gt;Yale-NUS’ curriculum took 2 to 3 years to develop, as it had to develop everything from scratch, including all major and minor studies programmes, as well as the common curriculum. The common curriculum forms about one-third of Yale-NUS’ educational requirements.  
&gt;  
&gt;New College will develop an interdisciplinary common curriculum for its students. This will be adapted and enhanced from USP and Yale-NUS’ existing common curriculums. This is achievable in one year.

(Source: [New College FAQ PDF on Yale-NUS website](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-0920-New-College-FAQs.pdf), pg 23)

Also, **being the pioneering batches mean you need to take initiative.**

All USP Interest Groups will be closed when you join NUS College (Source: [The Octant, 19 Feb 2022](https://theoctant.org/edition/issue/allposts/news/collaboration-not-integration-nus-college-dean-weighs-in/)). It's going to be up to you to take the initiative to start new NUSC student groups and help build up these student groups.

When facing all the aforementioned teething issues, it's going to be up to you to take the initiative to feedback to faculty &amp; staff and come up with suggestions on how to improve the College to make it a better experience for future batches.

It's also going to be up to you to take the initiative to create the College's culture and to initiate new programmes. The student culture and programmes you create can potentially affect years of future batches.

It's going to be up to you as the pioneers to determine if NUS College ends up with a community where students are truly ""open, collaborative, nurturing and intellectually curious"" and ""thrive on diversity, collaboration and mutual respect"" as [NUSC's website](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/grow/) claims.

# Other Special Programmes

&gt;... **You can't and shouldn't try to do everything**... One of the things that is different about this moment... \[is that\] you are in charge of your education, and you are going to have to make some choices.  
&gt;  
&gt;When I was a student, there was a brief moment when I thought about doing a combined degree of Law and Medicine, which was being created — I now realise, in retrospect — for people who couldn't decide... It *\[i.e. taking a combined degree in Law &amp; Medicine\]* would be a terrible mistake, because I do think you need to start deciding.  
&gt;  
&gt;NUS College offers all sorts of things, in terms of the rich, interdisciplinary training, but **it's not compatible with every programme that the university offers**...  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Prof Simon Chesterman, NUS Law Dean and NUS College Dean-designate (Source: [NUS Law 2022 Open House Undergrad Webinar](https://youtu.be/h-Vph5V4n6c?t=3175), emphasis mine)

NUS offers various other Special Programmes. **If you are an NUS College student, it will likely be difficult or even impossible for you to take part in some of these special programmes.**

I've listed a bunch of Special Programmes that NUS offers at the end of this post. See if any of them catches your eye and interests you. If you're interested in any of these Special Programmes, you should check if they'll be compatible with NUSC. If they are compatible, you should consider carefully whether you can juggle the workload of both the Special Programme and NUSC.

# Impact Experience Project

The Impact Experience Project (or IEx for short) is a *required* component of the NUSC programme. It'll last throughout your 2nd and 3rd year in NUSC. (Source: [NUSC website](https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/learn/impact-experience/))

Note that this isn't just volunteer work, there are ""pillars"" offered under IEx other than just service: research, innovation, and creative expression.

**It's important to note that there might be a bunch of other commitments you (and your IEx teammates) may have alongside IEx during your second and third year.** For example (not an exhaustive list):

* You and/or your teammates may wish to pursue an internship during Semester time, through NUS programmes such as [UPIP](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/internships/upip/), [FASSIP](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/career-preparation/internship/fass-internship/overview-of-modules-fassip/#AY2022/23), [Engineering IA](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/undergraduate/engineering-internships/), and [ATAP](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/industry/intern/student/atap/).
* You and/or your teammates may go overseas for an SEP or NOC.

**There are also some alternatives similar to IEx you can pursue** (all these alternatives are open to non-NUSC students):

* The [Chua Tian Poh Community Leadership Centre (CTPCLC)](https://ctpclc.nus.edu.sg/) offers both a [Minor in Community Development &amp; Leadership](https://ctpclc.nus.edu.sg/minor-programme) and a [Certificate in Community Development](https://ctpclc.nus.edu.sg/certificate-programme). In both the Minor &amp; Certificate programmes, you'll do [practicuum(s)](https://ctpclc.nus.edu.sg/practicums), which are group-based community research in partnership with community organisations.
* The College of Alice &amp; Peter Tan (CAPT) has a [Capstone Experience](https://capt.nus.edu.sg/current-students/overview-of-capstone) which is pretty similar to the IEx.
* The National Youth Council (NYC) offers the [Young ChangeMakers (YCM) grant](https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en/initiatives/grants/young-changemakers/) to S'poreans &amp; PRs between 15 to 35 years old.
* If you are interested in the research pillar of IEx, check out the [Undergraduate Research Programmes at NUS's various faculties](https://nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/research-opportunities).
* If you are interested in the innovation pillar of IEx, check out [NUS Enterprise](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/) to see the various support systems NUS has for students interested in innovation/start-ups.

# NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC)

One programme that has been repeatedly mentioned in NUS College's marketing is NOC.

Note NOC's goals is significantly different from those of NUS College. NOC is fundamentally **an entrepreneurship programme**.

**Not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship.** I am not an expert on entrepreneurship, but you can read about the ups &amp; downs of entrepreneurship in [this article from Inc.](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/jessica-bruder/psychological-price-of-entrepreneurship.html), [this article from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/12/22/what-to-expect-in-the-life-of-an-entrepreneur/?sh=5816ade774d4), and [this article from Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2020/10/why-entrepreneurship-is-so-hard). *(Content Warning: the Inc. article contains discussions on mental health, including dicussions on suicide.)*

Nonetheless, NOC is a great programme. If you aren't familiar with it, under NOC, you get to work at a start-up in regions like Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, as well as take entrepreneurship classes at prestigious unis like Stanford, NYU, Tsinghua, and the University of Toronto (Source: [NOC website](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/programmes/)).

**NUS College gives you ""priority access"" to NOC,** which is awesome if you want to be an entrepreneur since NOC is a really competitive programme.

In short, I don't think NOC is for everyone. However, for those who are cut out for &amp; interested in entrepreneurship, it's an excellent opportunity.

For Law students who want to go for NOC, note that you may need to extend the duration to complete your degree programme (Source: [NUS Law website](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/student_ex/application.html)).

Also, FYI:

* From AY2022/23, undergrads at SUTD will also get to take part in NOC (Source: [NUS Enterprise Press Release](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/news/nus-and-sutd-to-collaborate-on-innovation-and-enterprise/)).
* SMU has a similar programme: [Global Innovation Immersion](https://iie.smu.edu.sg/GII).

# Future Prospects

How will NUS College affect your job prospects after NUS?

I'm not a HR expert or recruiter, so I'm admittedly not an expert on this

However, based on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/oifrh7/how_useful_is_the_usp_certificate_when_looking/) in r/NUS, it seems like the USP certificate isn't recognised by most employers, except within the civil service. So, **I won't recommend joining NUSC for the prestige or to get a impressive new line in your CV.**

However, **that doesn't mean that NUS College won't help you in your job search.** There are still many other ways NUS College can help you with your future prospects, such as:

* The networks you'll build with your NUSC peers
* Your close relationship with profs in NUSC that can help with getting you recommendation letters e.g. for postgrad applications
* The seminar-style classes in NUSC can help train your communication skills which is necessary in virtually every job

Of course, **these things don't come automatically with being in NUSC, you need to be active in networking with peers, building relationships with your profs, etc.**

Beyond the above, every NUS student (incl. those not in NUSC) has access to a whole bunch of career resources. You can check out the [NUS CFG website](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cfg) and [this YouTube video by Amelia Yamato](https://youtu.be/UZcJUaIrRCk) for more information about these resources. Other local unis have their own career centres as well (Source: [GradGoWhere](https://youthopia.sg/resources/gradgowhere/)).

# Some parting words

I hope this post has been helpful!

If you find out you are no longer interested in NUSC, please reject your offer and inform NUS know about it, so that they can let another deserving candidate on the waitlist take your spot!

If you join NUSC, please share your NUSC experiences here on this subreddit to help your juniors make a more informed decision about their NUSC offer!

Lastly, regardless of which path you choose, I wish you all the best for your future endeavours! :D

# Summary: Key Qns to Ask Yourself

1. Are you able to afford the extra \~$3.5-4k of residential fees *per semester* and the extra cost of going overseas (including airfare, accommodation, &amp; insurance, among other things)? If you have financial aid and/or scholarship(s), are they enough to cover the extra costs of NUSC?
2. Are you going to take advantage of NUS College's small class sizes? Are you willing to actively engage in class discussions and hear different perspectives from your peers?
3. Do you want to pursue stuff that will take up your UEs, such as a 2nd major, minor, specialisation, learning a new language, or getting greater depth in your major? If so, how feasible is it to pursue these with the reduced number of UEs you have after the NUS College curriculum has ""eaten up"" some of your UEs?
4. Do you think you'll be able to cope with the extra rigour of NUS College modules, even as you adjust to the new environment of university?
5. Are you prepared to be rather restricted when planning your classes for your second half in university if you decide your major late?
6. Are you willing to deal with the risks and teething issues that come with being the inagural batch (or one of the first few batches) of NUS College?
7. Are you willing to work on the Impact Experience team project alongside your academics and other commitments in Year 2 and 3? Are there oher alternatives to the IEx that are better suited for you?
8. Are there any Special Programmes you wish to pursue other than NUS College? If so, are they compatible with NUS College? If they are compatible with NUS College, how difficult will it be to juggle both programmes (in addition to your Major, CCAs, etc.)?
9. If you are interested in NOC, are you sure NOC is suited for you? If you plan to pursue Law, are you prepared for NOC to extend the duration of your degree programme?
10. Are you joining NUS College just for the prestige or to flex it in your job applications?
11. Are you willing to initiative as the pioneer batch of NUS College to start new student groups and actively provide feedback?

# Appendix: List of Special Programmes in NUS

Once again, I'd like to note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.

* [Special Programme in Science](https://sps.nus.edu.sg/) (SPS)

SPS involves interdisciplinary modules in Science, mentorship, a tight-nit community, and research opportunities (Source: [FOS website](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/special-programmes/special-programme-in-science-sps/)). SPS alumni have gone on to pursue postgraduate studies &amp; careers in places like Harvard, Yale, Duke-NUS, ETH Zurich, A\*STAR, and Facebook (Source: [SPS Open House 2022](https://youtu.be/wBmK1iHRQeA?t=1303)).

Regarding taking both SPS &amp; USP (NUSC's predecessor), the [SPS FAQ page](https://sps.nus.edu.sg/faq/) says:

&gt;It is certainly possible for one to complete more than one academic programme and pursue their many interests, along with SPS. However, one should expect that it would be challenging to hold onto multiple commitments. We do have many success stories of seniors who have overcome the challenges and packed their undergraduate years with a variety of programs and experiences. You can apply to SPS and other academic programmes concurrently. Students who intend to undertake more than one programme are advised to give their decision careful thought. You should take into consideration your interests, commitment and suitability before doing so.

* [Special Programme in Mathematics](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/ug/spm/) (SPM)

SPM offers special modules in foundation modules that are taught in greater depth. Other than Math majors, it is also open to students in related majors (Quantitative Finance, Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering). (Source: SPM website linked above)

These SPM modules are small-group modules and it can help you get a recommendation letter for graduate school. These SPM modules have an extra hour of tutorials and extra 1MC each, increasing your workload and potentially decreasing your UE space (discussed above). (Source: [SPM Programme Summary PDF slides](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/11/SPM-Briefing-202011.pdf))

* [French Double Degree Programme](https://fddp.nus.edu.sg/index.html) (FDDP)

Allows you to receive a Bachelors &amp; Masters degree from NUS and a Diplôme d’Ingénieur from  Grandes Écoles (equivalent to French Masters, source: [NUS Bulletin](https://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/ay202122/programmes/double-degree-programmes/)) in just five years.

Grandes Écoles enrolls the top 0.15% of France students and over 60% of the Managing Directors and Chief Executives in France’s 100 largest firms graduated from the Grandes Écoles (Source: FDDP website linked above).

* Other [Residential College (RC) Programmes](https://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/campus-living/residential-options/residential-colleges): University Town College Programme (UTCP) at [Tembusu College](https://tembusu.nus.edu.sg/), [College of Alice &amp; Peter Tan](https://capt.nus.edu.sg/) (CAPT), and [Residential College 4](https://rc4.nus.edu.sg/) (RC4); as well as the [Ridge View Residential College](https://rvrc.nus.edu.sg/) (RVRC) Programme

These RCs offer a programme that is somewhat similar to NUSC. Like NUSC, UTCP &amp; RVRC involve a two year residential stay and provides multidisciplinary modules in a small class setting (although you take less RC modules in UTCP &amp; RVRC than the 14 modules you take in NUSC). However, UTCP &amp; RVRC modules will typically *not* reduce your UEs, unlike NUSC.

* [NUS Law + Minor Programme](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/llb_prog/minor_programmes.html)

NUS Law students can pursue a Minor in a non-Law subject. Unlike the NUS College curriculum which includes modules from a wide variety of disciplines, a Minor might be more suitable if you want to focus on a specific non-Law area such as Computer Science, Psychology, or Forensic Science.

NUS Law students in USP (NUSC's predecessor) and NOC (one of the possible Global Experiences under NUSC) could not take a minor (Source: [NUS Law website](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/llb_prog/minor_programmes.html)).

* NUS Law Exchange Plus Programme

The Exchange Plus Programme allows Law students to spend their 4th year at an overseas university, such as University of Toronto, New York University, King's College London, and University of Melbourne, to receive both a Bachelor and Masters (LLB and LLM) in just four years. (Source: [NUS Undergraduate Programme website for prospective students](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/admissions/llb_prog.html)).

* [Law (LLB) and Public Policy (MPP) Concurrent Degree Programme (CDP)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/prog/mpplaw/index.htm)

This CDP allows you to get both a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) and a Master of Public Policy (MPP) in 4.5 years. Even if you haven't applied for this CDP or applied but failed to get in, you can still apply for it later after the second year of your LLB. Note that USP (one of NUSC's predecessor) was not compatible with this CDP (Source: [NUS Law website](https://law1.nus.edu.sg/admissions/llb_usp.html)).

* [Turing Programme for Computer Science Majors](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/tp/)

The Turing Programme is for students interested in research and aims to equip students to enter top schools for PhD programmes. However, it further reduces you UEs."

ubnlos,106,2022-04-25,Some corrections for the post about crazy Korean community,Traditional_Lemon_14,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ubnlos/some_corrections_for_the_post_about_crazy_korean/,"Hello, Just to introduce myself, I’m a Korean international student currently going to a high school in US. Before I explain more details about the situation, I want to verify that crazy Korean community that posts false hate posts about t30 universities. 

That online community is dcinside, one of the most conservative and popular online community in Korea. Similar to reddit, dcinside is also divided into subs, each community having a totally different characteristics from one another. And subs in dcinside could also be classified into two types: minor sub and major sub.

The major subs are basically subs with no moderator. So even though some internet trolls write spams in the community, there’s no way to control what they post.

Now the minor subs are different. One moderator would appoint other deputies and control the posts in the sub. 

There’s a major sub called “foreign, abroad users” in dcinside (I will just call it as major sub) and there used to be lots of “normal” Korean students who would share their experience living in US. 

But about three years ago, one user started to use vpn to change its ip(works as username in dcinside) and wrote multiple hate posts about specific universities. Other korean users protested but there was no way to control what this vpn user posts. 
The hot posts in this major sub is controlled by this one internet troll who writes hate posts about ucla, nyu, and other countless universities.
I believe that the sub that the person who wrote about the Korean community went to the major sub and got shocked about the hate posts there.

But this is not the Korean sub that represents the perspectives of normal Korean students studying in US. 
About 6 months ago, majority of the normal Korean users decided to make a minor sub that could delete the hate posts and kick out that internet troll.
This minor sub is called “Korean students studying in US” and is free from all the hate posts. 

If you go into that sub, there are many korean users writing posts that even though they graduated from t100 universities in US, they were still able to get a job or internships from big firms. This sub proves to students that going to a low-ranking university doesn’t impact your future career that much.

ubnrlt,0,2022-04-25,[CA] What is the most effective way to collect unemployment as a sub over the summer?,championofobscurity,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ubnrlt/ca_what_is_the_most_effective_way_to_collect/,"Covid combined with California's general teaching shortage allowed me to work full time as a sub at a competitive salary range. However, covid really cleared out of my area around February. 

They are definitely keeping me on for the rest of the school year as a formality to make sure they have the labor in place for next year before they let me go. Most days as of late they have 0 need for the two of us roving subs on campus, and they have us sit in the break room and do yard duty for lunches.

All that said, they have a huge excess of labor rn. Which is fine I intend to intern teach next school year..


That said I would like to pad my summer months with unemployment until I have a firm offer in place. I will have my final checks coming in but they would be payment for previous months' work. Anyway what is the best way to go about this. I get a lot of mixed messaging about Unemployment for subs in California so I'd like to speak to anyone with experience on the matter.

Thanks much!"

ubql9c,64,2022-04-25,The Power of Prestige is still very real if you plan to major in business (stats inside),Entity001,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ubql9c/the_power_of_prestige_is_still_very_real_if_you/,"Recently a lot of posts have cropped up downplaying the significance of prestige when it comes to job prospects. It’s true that many job sectors don’t really care about the ranking of the school on your diploma: engineering, STEM, and other “hard” sciences come to mind. **But if you’re planning on going into finance, consulting, business, there are certainly significant benefits to be had by attending an Ivy or other “prestigious” university.**

To anyone who disagrees, you need to understand that “prestige” is part of the business model. An HR department in charge of selecting which candidates get interviews might know that the true difference in education between a graduate of an Ivy and one of a flagship state school is basically indistinguishable - **but does the client?** Layman prestige is very real, and if your company identity is based upon appearing “smart” and “prestigious” (McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, etc), you keep that perception intact by hiring people from the most “smart” and “prestigious” sounding universities. This is a dynamic that you will find in basically every client facing business career.

This is reflected in the [data](https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/consulting-target-schools) as well: 

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qm5Cm00.jpg)

When looking at which schools send the most undergraduates to the “Big Three” consulting firms, the clear winners here are Harvard and UPenn (so basically Wharton). The usual culprits like Yale, Stanford, MIT, etc make an appearance on the top too.  But how does this compare to a state flagship?

Lets compare these “top targets” to the “weaker” targets like USC. USC is still an incredibly well regarded and connected school for business, **but even so, top targets consistently send 3-5x (or for the top two schools I previously mentioned, 7x) the amount of graduates to the big consulting firms.** Now imagine what the comparison to a state school would be like (which isn’t even present in the data).

[This unbelievably too heavy trend also holds true at the top finance jobs.](https://i.imgur.com/bs8FRcK.jpg) 
[(source)](https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/ib-target-schools)

This is not to say that the only route to a job in consulting, financed or other business profession comes from a prestigious university. Nor is it to say that finance jobs come easily and plentifully to students of a select few universities (it’s still brutally competitive). **However, this “prestige” makes companies come to you. **They’ll actively attempt to make connections with your school, build networks with your faculty, or even provide a set number of internships per year. So while a Harvard student obviously can’t walk into McKinsey and be offered a six figure job without question, they might receive an *invitation* to interview where another student would not. 

Tl;dr: It is an undeniable fact that business as an industry prefers, and will give favor to, prestigious degrees. A2C recently tends to overcompensate in the opposite direction, but please try to see past the hype of either side as the you make your final decisions."

I want to get into this field, end goal OS and IS. This seems like a good opportunity so much I teared up when I saw the email. 

Below is a redacted copy of the email, 

It sounds like you had a great conversation with _____ and _____ about an internship opportunity on our Logical Database Administrator Team.  I’m excited to chat with you in more detail about your availability and salary expectations in connection with this opportunity.  Are there certain dates/times this week that work best for you to have a short 15 minute (or less) call?

 

I look forward to hearing back from you.

 

Sincerely,



*******

This is an internship so I think the salary part was an accident.

I have done some research and checked the medium and low to high end ranges of employment $. 

My question is, do I have room to negotiate? It seems our interview went well (I really enjoyed it) and i don’t want to get low balled. 

I currently make $30.00 an hour at my job, anyone with experience here or anyone in HR, advice please? 

This internship will unlock so many doors for me."

I recently received 2 job offers at Amazon and at a big 4, both in Luxembourg. I am really confused which offer I should accept and would like to get your opinion (and btw, I just finished my masters degree).

On on hand, Amazon is like a dream company to me, with a more appealing role, a slightly better compensation package (in my opinion), and probably better looking on the CV. On the other hand, it is only 6 month internship, and therefore I dont have a guaranteed job for the long term.

In the big 4, it is a full time position, being a safer option. Also, I was told that career progression in relativery faster compared with amazon, and it is somewhat easy to change areas/roles within the firm. Moreover, I would exposed to more industries, and different clients. So I would probably learn more.

Additionaly, I would like to add that i really value a good work life balance, and career progression.

I apologize if this has been asked before, but I have a question regarding internship requirements.

Let's take Google (Dublin) as an example.

I intend to apply for an internship once I finish my Master's in CSE (around summer of 2023) at Google, given that it's the straightforward way to work for such a company without prior experience, which is my case.
However, all I find are internships that require applicants to be enrolled in any degree related to the field at application time.

Does this mean that, once I've completed my degree, I won't be able to apply to said internships?

Thank you very much for your attention!"

How important were your first year grades when you applied for summer internships? I’m at a target uni but I’m worried I might be close to getting a 2.2 at the end of the year. First year for my uni is only worth 9% anyway so I can defo get a 2.1/1.1 at the end of my degree.

Just wondering if this is going to seriously affect my IBD summer internship application later this year. I have strong extracurriculars and a few spring insight (UBS, DB) programmes. My biggest worry is being automatically rejected from firms due to a low first year grade or being severely disadvantaged. 

Would really appreciate any insight on this from any UK students. Thanks!"

I’m a HR manager at a medium sized company. I am the only person in HR, and this is my first job out of uni (been in the role for approx 2.5 years).
I think I am ready to move on for a few reasons:
- I am extremely burnt out. Being the only person in HR I am always switched on, taking calls and emails on weekends, public holidays etc that are urgent. I also have an office in the US and employees in the UK so am constantly dealing with different time zones and wake up to tonnes of emails each day because of it. I also can never take time off properly, as I have to address urgent matters and process payroll each week at minimum (we have a payroll officer but I have to be involved in part of it and check wages before they are processed). 
- since this is my first role out of uni (apart from internships) and I don’t have any real mentorship or a team, I don’t know if I’m getting it all right. I try to research as best I can, utilise my knowledge and I am making it work, but I just know there are things I could be doing better, but I don’t have the experience or support and am trying to be realistic with myself about my capacity as a recent grad. I want to find an opportunity that has more support so I can learn more. Similarly, I think a lot more can be done in this role and in this company and I think someone far more experienced should be in my role. 

I was planning to resign and give 2-3 weeks notice (2 weeks is minimum required). I don’t have another HR job lined up as I think I want a bit of time to decompress. It would also be very tricky to try to interview while at my current role, with the structure of the company the only person that could give insightful reference into my role would be the COO,  and I’d rather not tell them my foot is half way out the door but ‘oh please don’t get rid if me yet but please give me a good reference’. 
I plan to pick up extra hours at my old retail job I’m still employed at (I loved this job so it wouldn’t be too stressful) just to stay afloat and then maybe a month down the track, reach out to my COO (hoping things ended amicably) to get a reference. 

Some things stopping me from resigning:
- I am paid quite well, although there is still room for growth in the salary aspect. Taking a pay cut/losing the stability makes me very nervous
- The company is hiring a senior HR person based in the US, but I feel as our company so majority based in Aus (90/10 split) they still need someone more experienced than me in my role
- Get benefits like a very casual culture &amp; dress code, they pay my phone bill etc, fantastic experience even though it’s very stressful.. 
- I love the people, and I am incredibly grateful to a number of the senior management team that have batted for me and supported me. Leaving them and disappointing them is really scary. 

I just really don’t want to back myself into a corner in terms of only knowing how things are done here, which I get the feeling not everything is done the best/most efficient way. I worry if I stay for too long, 5 years down the track when I want to leave I’ll have to start from the bottom because of this. 

Should I resign? Opinions and thoughts are all very welcomed, I’m overwhelmed and confused about what is the right move. Thanks all

ETA: I am not crazy concerned about the pay situation, I will get paid out approx 6 weeks of wages due to my annual leave balance and have some money in savings I can dip into, I’d just rather use as little as possible and hate the idea that I’m going “backwards”"

Advice?,bradysoul,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/uc1fc9/last_person_on_my_team_but_accepted_offer/,"My coworker just put in his two weeks, which means me, my boss, and a new intern will be the only members of our team left. They planned on giving me a bunch of new work and a role that’s more commission based once I graduate college, but I already have signed an offer letter elsewhere for late June. He may start loading my old coworkers stuff on to me with the assumption that I’m staying with the company. 

The firm I work for is small, never fires people, and has generally lax leadership. 
Previously, someone in my role has given 1 month notice and was treated perfectly fine before they left.

I want to let my boss know I’m quitting in June, but maybe I’m jumping the gun a little bit. However, I’m tired of lying through my teeth at work claiming how I am excited to move forward in my new role and I don’t want to do unnecessary work with no extra pay ahead of June.

For context I’m a 24f. Recently graduated in December with my Bachelors in Accounting. Resume is mostly filled with positions as a finance intern doing clerical work or in data entry positions where I manually cleaned data in excel. I would appreciate any thoughts on these  two offers.

Option 1. Data analyst for a public university. I would be in charge of their tableau dashboards and learn sql along side my supervisor. I have worked with them for 2 years while I was in college and it’s a small office. I didn’t consider them when graduating but they made the offer and they said they would create/ask for a full time position so I could continue to work there and help out.  

Pros:
- learning how to manage data and learn a new language
- Get my masters for free in tech
- Opportunities in data related fields and with my accounting major it could help
- Close relationship with management 
- Good working environment
- Work life balance


Cons: 
- will have to wait until august for full time after budget is finalized (working part time til then)
- Not in my major 
- Pays 5-10k below from the other (on a scale I was shown of what I could possibly make as a full time staff)

Option 2. A big4 accounting firm. I interned with them this winter and it wasn’t anything exciting. I didn’t do much work but got good feedback. Since it was busy season I didn’t get to learn as much as I would like.

Pros: 
- Prestigious firm
- Pays more
- Good exit opportunities
- Offered to be part of a program for 2-3 months that essentially just pays you to study for your CPA before joining

Cons:
- missing 15 credits to 150 (need it before September) essentially more schooling
- The work environment was okay
- Questionable work life balance

Also, I just came back to work for the school from my internship. And I would leave for the program by end of May. If I do choose the firm, how do I break the news to the school?"

Hey everyone,

I'm an electrical engineering student enrolled in a university in India, aiming to apply for software development roles and internships. I am currently at the end of the 2nd year of my 4 year program.

I have applied to approximately 50 internships over the past year. Of these, I got rejected/ghosted in all but 3 (All of them being small 5-20 employee startups\], but in these 3 I was able to clear interview and technical rounds, leading me to believe I could definitely improve on my resume.

I'd love whatever feedback you can give me."
uc4jos,4,2022-04-26,"When do you feel ""experienced""?",Forrox,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uc4jos/when_do_you_feel_experienced/,"So yeah, this is a bit of a vent thread, but I just feel like it never gets easier to secure interviews and get the kind of attention you want even with more than 1 internship under your belt. I'm sure if you look at my post or comment history you'll think my experience is worthless, but I'm trying to do all my job hopping as an intern so I don't have to deal with the stress of uprooting myself after I'm at a full-time job if I don't end up somewhere that I'm comfortable at right after graduation. I'd like to get to a tech company and I think I got pretty close to Amazon this past interview cycle. Anyway, Im 2 internships in as of this summer and looking to start a third this fall, and it just feels like it does NOT ever get easier to get responses from companies. I struggle to imagine how I got interviews with essentially nothing on my resume when I have a decent amount of experience (admittedly some is prospective) and I still have to send out hundreds of applications.

What are you people with 3+ internships at tech companies making $50+/hour as undergrads doing?"

I joined DoorDash as an intern during the summer of 2021 to test Filibuster’s applicability to the DoorDash platform. My work produced positive preliminary results along those lines, while also affording me an opportunity to extend Filibuster’s core algorithms and to implement support for new programming languages and RPC frameworks. I wanted to share some of the results of my work and how bringing Filibuster to DoorDash has enhanced not only Filibuster, but has paved the way for a new style of resilience testing for DoorDash’s engineers.

uc5knk,11,2022-04-26,Have I ruined my life? Big 4 career? Regrets,Imoverthinking21,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/uc5knk/have_i_ruined_my_life_big_4_career_regrets/,"23 F. Usually very positive and ambitious person. From state school background - ok GCSEs then worked really hard at A Levels to get unconditional offer into Law degree at Russell Group Uni - transferred course to Business Mgt. Worked alongside education since 16 and basically did everything to ensure a great career/future. During 2nd year of uni applied to (around 5/6) for internships  - most had closed and got into Big 4 firm and was offered a grad place for following year (Sept ‘20). 

This is where things go wrong. I’ve noticed that whenever I regret things I can find it paralysing. When I first regretted choosing the wrong degree and having to wait a year to transfer to another degree I beat myself up so badly to the point where I could not get out of bed and had to force myself - however this only lasted a few weeks and I focused on reading positive quotes which really helped me. That decision turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. 

When I started my grad job it was during the pandemic so everything was wfh. Now before I took my role I knew it was include exams (ATT/CTA)and I tend to get exam anxiety so I was worried about this but figured even a year of experience at big 4 would be great. However everytime exams came around I found that I’d freak out that I wouldn’t have enough time to prepare and my end career goal has never been to be a CTA. 

Just last summer I decided that perhaps because of the exams this role wasn’t for me. The work and exams proved to be a lot especially as everything was also wfh and I had moved back to my family home. It was tough as I have quite a large family and the grad scheme was totally different because of the pandemic. I had multiple exams in the summer and it made me feel majorly depressed since lockdown had started to lift and I am quite extroverted and work/exams felt endless. I was studying for the summer exams while going to college for November exams while also trying to pass my driving test. 

I was also in a long term relationship which had come to an end as he felt I was draining him by being sad and he would say things like I’m not cut for the role and My friends would want to be friends with me anymore because of my negative feelings .  felt overwhelmed and even when I tried to have fun I felt so bogged down by all of this. 

At the end of September I decide to defer my nov exams to May this year so I could have free time where I could also apply for grad schemes for the following year. However I didn’t do this instead I started to dregret the deferral and couldn’t even get out of bed as I was so convinced that I had ruined my life since the exams would take longer now and I’d miss out on more of my life.  

I felt like this for a month and then I realised I could’ve sat the exams and blamed myself for not realising. A month later in December I realised alll of this worrying had lead me to not apply to any grad schemes which made me feel sick so then I blamed myself for that. 

Work gave me months off to sort my mental health and I had counselling as well as endless support from family and friends who told me that nothing was really wrong I’d just moved some exams I was just being hard on myself. Idk why I was just so stuck in the past and couldn’t see that everything was fine now - it was fine that I hadn’t applied to any grad roles as I’d be an experienced hire anyways. I was supposed to go back to work in Jan and I just didn’t - I truly felt my life was ruined since I hadn’t applied for another grad rile which I know realise is idiotic bc I already had a great job and a supportive team. Since I didn’t go back to work and fill in my timesheets I was fired a few weeks ago. 

I don’t know why I completely gave up on life a few months ago (literally stopped getting out of bed) only surviving bc of my parents - nothing bad had even really happened I just felt so depressed-!: (think antidepressants may have also fucked me up). and even tho last summer was stressful this year the exams were more spread out with none in the summer. I’ve really messed up and have no idea what to do. I’m too anxious to apply for another job and feel like my future is ruined.

(Also had anxiety for years but idk why I didn’t use any of my coping mechanisms as I genuinely thought my life was over). Why wouldn’t I listen to anyone!!! *facepalm*"

It’s hard to reject a good paying offer letter that you worked hard for, haha. I’m sure someone can relate to it. Working in a SWE company that’s super chill at working hours, I think is doable. 

Also, it’s a smart way to seek more knowledge and make great money, I guess. I don’t know if it’s legal to work? And I’m sure IRS doesn’t really care during end of the year tax return.

I very much enjoyed the people and the work. My bi monthly performance reviews were just a 15 min chat with my supervisor about what I'm doing, what I want be doing and what I need help with. Nothing was really written down and it was pretty informal, and sometimes my supervisor would just cancel em if he felt nothing of substance would come from it.

Fast forward to today, I started a full time position working tier 2 IT for a much larger company. I had my first month performance review last Friday, it was entirely based around this enormous spreadsheet of numbers and metrics that my manager poured over for more than an hour. 

I was just hoping to see if maybe I'm just spoiled for thinking this feels disingenuous, impersonal, and less effective than the other method? 

Or if this is a genuine problem many people have and that I should possibly look for something else?"

I feel like I'm really struggling with this, or just in general with the degree.

For an overview of the subject, we use C for assignments and pseudo code and lots of writing for the final exam. I feel like I get the theory of all these algorithms and data strucuture starting from like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's but I don't know how to bring this to practicality.

For example, my first assignment (using C) for this subject was to create a skip list (which was basically linked-list so I was kinda fine with), and graphs where I have to find shortest path etc etc using dijkstras. I knew in theory what kind of things these assignments are asking me for, but I don't know how to code it.

Is there any way I can practice these algorithms so I can smash these assignments in a shorter time frame. Or just in general I'm not sure how to practice programming so I can get better at it. Where should I be starting?

I also am not sure how relevant this is to industrial requirement to get an internship and job later. What will I be doing with this knowledge later?

Everytime when I talk to other people doing the subject and how they are going with their projects/assignments, everyone seems to be well-off, know what they are doing, but I spend too much time tryna even get started with these. It makes me question how I could be so slow compared to other when we are all learning same thing at the same time."

This is my only admit this year, and I'm a bit torn about whether to accept this offer or not. I had a few doubts regarding the program, it would be amazing if someone could help me with them.

1. Does the CE coursework involve a lot of hardware-related courses, or is it possible to get by on choosing CS related courses such as databases? I have no hardware background, I'm assuming it would be extremely tough for me to catch up.

2. Does NYU being away from the bay area, and studying computer engineering instead of computer science affect my standing for jobs?

3. Is it possible to switch programs to MS CS after joining?

4. Because the department is Electrical and Computer Engineering, would it affect being able to take up normal software development jobs on a student visa (since it requires the job to be in the same area as your degree)?

5. What type of projects do students take up in advanced project? What is the difference between ECE-GY 9953 or CS-GY 9963, and does taking CS-GY 9963 count towards the quota of 6 credits allowed from other departments?

ucbqz1,118,2022-04-26,"1 week before Summer, I finally got an offer",SoftSaan,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/ucbqz1/1_week_before_summer_i_finally_got_an_offer/,"I think that I’m a failure. But I also think that I have a good partner who supports me despite my failures. 

Just wanted to put this out here because summer is beginning and I wanted to get things off my chest. I am an incredibly lazy person who procrastinates a lot and more often than not, this ends up screwing me over &amp; results in me submitting sub-par work. My grades have tanked my laziness and I’d figure that’s why I didn’t get many replies from the companies that I’ve applied to. My grades aren’t terrible but they aren’t stellar too.

This year’s application for summer internships has been rough for me. I didn’t get any responses back from companies that I’ve applied to and by March, I’ve only secured one interview. I had sacrificed quite a lot for that interview: skipping lectures (really too tired after spending a lot of time and effort on the take-home assessment) not paying attention to tutorials (because the interview was right after). I don’t think it was dumb for me to do so because if I had gotten that internship it would have been worth it. The only thing was that I didn’t get it.

It didn’t affect me too much even though I felt sad and I continued applying for other internship positions. I managed to secure 2 other interviews and got rejected another 2 times - one of which was something that I thought I’d really enjoyed. And so the application process continued with me spamming my applications in hopes that I would get an internship.

Tbh I felt like I’ve hit an all time low when I was interviewed at a company that told me during my interview to ‘give them a moment’ as they were interviewing other candidates at the same time. I felt that it was super disrespectful but continued onto the second round because I just wanted any position at this point. I had the second interview and it wasn’t great as expected. The interviewer was clearly distracted, dismissive and had asked if I could speak Chinese (didn’t really like this because it was seemed similar to the Shopee incident). I remember thinking that if I was competent enough, I wouldn’t have put myself through this because frankly, despite how terrible the company seemed to me, I would have really accepted the offer if they gave me one. Glad they didn’t. 

I never stopped applying because I didn’t feel daunted by the non-replies &amp; rejection. I just remember that before one of the interviews the night before, I ended up crying because I felt like I was a failure (which I do admit that I am). Surprisingly it was that interview which landed me with my first offer for summer this year. I finally gotten an offer 1 week before summer started. At the same time, I did another interview with a company that I wanted to join but again, I didn’t manage to get the position. 

So yes, after multiple applications, interviews, and rejections, I finally managed to get one offer. And I would say that a part of why I didn’t give up was because my partner was always there supporting me. 

Didn’t get an offer from a company that I liked? It’s okay, sometimes the team might just not feel that your vibe fits them

Had a bad interview? It’s okay, interviews are a great way to see if you feel like the company is a good fit for you too

Still haven’t secured a summer internship? It’s okay, even though the big companies have stopped hiring, there are still other companies that might be hiring round the year

What if I can’t secure an internships? It’s okay, you can take the summer to build up your portfolio and do up a personal website to distinguish yourself next time

I don’t think neither me nor my partner were in self denial - I knew my major wasn’t very applicable, my partner told me that my resume could be improved and also that I didn’t have enough experience ‘selling’ myself during interviews. 

But I’m glad that my partner was able to encourage my internship hunt in such a positive way: my partner didn’t rush me to apply (some might say that my partner doesn’t have to so because it’s my life but nevertheless, this prevented me from being on tether-hooks throughout the month), wasn’t condescending and helped me see the positive side of things in many many situations.

I think I’m an incredibly lucky person, having a supportive partner, somehow managing to secure a decent internship at a reputable company one week before summer and heck even sometimes getting away with my procrastination. I’m not proud of who I am right now but I’m grateful for all the stars that aligned."

I was hired this month as junior DE by a company that do market research, there are like 20 employees, most of them analysts and statisticians. Before me there was only one guy with a CS background, doing the “DE” / DBA work. But even before him, all was done spaghetti-like by the non DE people that founded the company.

Now about me: I am from Brazil, don’t have any experience whatsoever on DE, nor anything real, because i didn’t even have an internship during university (it was not required for degree), i’m actually fresh out of my CS degree. I wanted to work with DE and was doing DataCamp DE track last month. And then I found this job where they didn’t want to pay much for someone, but didn’t ask for anything too. And I was not landing a job anywhere, so i accepted. 

I don’t make anything near the salary you guys usually talk about DE, mostly because it’s Brazil so our coin have no value next to dollar, second because of what i said above, but according to [this brazilian major ‘news’](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/bbc/2021/12/13/calculadora-de-renda-90-brasileiros-ganham-menos-de-r-35-mil-confira-sua-posicao-lista.htm) I am the ""average Brazilian"", who earns almost twice what the ""median Brazilian"" earns, and I’m above 80% of the population. R$ 3000 for my first job with no experience if anyone is curious)

So, they hired me and told: “look, right now we have everything working, but we want to improve things, we are just not in a rush, you don’t have any experience, here you will have the opportunity to learn \[by yourself\] and try to apply for us”. 

So i’m continuing the courses at DataCamp, the company uses AWS so i’m also doing [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) looking to grab the first AWS certification then study for Solutions Architect Associate with the next course of this same guy. I do some python and SQL exercises in HackerRank and I watch many videos on youtube about DE.

Now about the state of data in the company: we have 5 projects for different companies, one of them being a big bank. We send hundreds of thousands of emails, messages and even phone calls to clients on behalf of the bank to do a satisfaction survey (it's all automated and not something i'll have to deal). We use Lime Survey for that. On the biggest project, we receive something like 30k responses per month, while the average is 5k for all projects. Also, on the biggest project, the survey generate something like 1500 variables which we do various crossings according with the profile of the person and etc. \[sorry but this is what i found to be useful to try to show the size of our data\].

Now here comes where I think the problem start and where i could start trying to change, remember, everything is working and they are not in a hurry, but my goal is to make a real data pipeline. Right now, the LimeSurvey for each project is running on a RDS ec2 on aws. Why? Because they do all the data transformation, all the analysis and everything else inside the RDS which is where the LimeSurvey is connected too.

As we have one RDS for every project, you can start to see where the costs come from. So, i’ve been reading a lot and had an idea, to extract these responses and put them on S3 and then transform with something like dbt, is this a good start?

One other thing, after consisting the data (the process which is done all with mysql procedures inside the RDS machine), some of the statisticians usually requests custom analysis that we can provide via python scripts, this first month i worked with scripts they already used, and was able to improve them by a lot, for example one which usually took more than 10 hours to run, according to them, i made run in half an hour with multiprocessing, not even changing the logic yet because i think everything it does is super inefficient.

So thats the thing, in my vision they are very mature business wise, and statistics wise, i mean is a very cool result they give, but computational wise they are very very immature, lots of inefficiences because they didn’t have someone to look on this side.

What you guys think is the best approach? Based on what i said about the size of the data can you suggest something for me to study and try to implement a pipeline? I’m all open for advices."

Last semester we were required to finish 150-hours of internship. The semester is over, but I am not still done. I think I'm the only one in my class that is not finished.

See, I applied for an internship that I thought that it could help me come out of my comfort zone. But then, I felt overwhelmed with the tasks to finish the required hours, and with minimum to NO supervisions at all, I was all over the place. It didn't help that I am embarrassed about asking for assistance, performance anxiety, and I have a hard time doing things on my own, like I have to be assigned or supervised for my gears to start moving and get stuff done. But I couldn't open up about my struggles to my professor or supervisor, I feel that it's not a valid reason, or it's too personal for a professional setting.

I've been having a hard time mustering up the energy to do the tasks and it takes me at least two weeks to make progress. I'm very burned out from my studies. I should have finished the internship a month ago. But I still have so many tasks left.

Now, I feel like I won't graduate on time. A lot of people will be disappointed, especially my family. And it eats me up everyday, among my other mental burdens--- that I think of ending my life just so I don't have to feel the weight of being a failure once everything sets in.

I want to drop out, I want to quit, I want to end it all. But I'm almost there. I feel pathetic because others pulled through it, but not me...

I just got out of a massive breakdown, I don't know if there's any point of trying to be alive when I'm so tired. I just had to do ONE thing and I'm screwing up. I just want it done..."

Currently I am working at a tiny startup with little to no mentorship and am desperately looking for an entry-level position (mobile or web development) at any company in Canada (or US remote) that could provide me with mentorship and growth opportunities such that I can become a much better coder and maximize my contribution. That is not to say that I am not looking for learning opportunities on my own (e.g. working towards getting an AWS certification, took a React course to address any gaps I had in my knowledge, eager to implement automated testing using Jest and Detox, and looking to better my web UI skills). I have applied to around 100 places and, while I am receiving callbacks (sometimes have interview day after day in a week), I find that I am constantly flunking the technical interviews. This can range from some trivia questions such as what is the React Native bridge to asking to solve a coding challenge (not even of medium difficulty). I will admit my mistake was going head in without thorough preparation at some times, but every rejection seems to be taking a toll on my mental health.

I guess if I was to give up, I would dedicate time exclusively to CTCI, LeetCode, and upskilling (e.g. getting better at native mobile development, working on CSS skills, and generally working on acing tech interviews).

To some extent I am told it is a numbers game but as more and more interviews pass I am finding it harder to believe that and am beginning to believe that whatever skills I have developed were worthless at the end of the day.

Otherwise not sure about what to do and not sure how exactly to proceed. Is it just keep applying, improving, and hope something works out, or take a step back so that I can put everything into perspective and hopefully come back way stronger. With the latter case, not sure how that would look like as every company has their own tech stack, etc."

I am an engineering manager for an org that doesn't hire entry level generally. The difficulties on both sides have been well detailed [elsewhere](https://www.notonlycode.org/nobody-hires-juniors/). I want to hire juniors, and the team wants to do so, and we're trying to pull together a program that would work.

So, I have a few questions. In aligning incentives, the truth is that it can take 6-12 months to where a junior developer is able to contribute at a meaningful level. Some of the ideas I am considering are:

* Developing a ""post-grad"" internship program. Consider it a 6 month position at below market rates for people who have graduated. After the program, the people that work out are hired at market rate for a junior. This could be open to both code camp and post-CS developers.
* Develop an internship program for people in the junior year for programs like Northwestern or Waterloo that allow for these types of semester-long internships, and then have a pathway for people who do well to have a conditional offer. (This is a more traditional path.) 

I'm looking for out of the box solutions that are fair for new developers, but don't lead to us paying for someone who can't contribute meaningfully at their salary position and then jump the moment they're just getting productive."

ucm2lv,1,2022-04-26,Struggling with motivation to finish my degree and I'm considering several options. I feel like a failure and I'm not good enough.,ThrowRAfeelsguilty,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ucm2lv/struggling_with_motivation_to_finish_my_degree/,"I am a 22 year old female living in California (not from here though), and somewhat financially independent aside from some money I get from am extended relative. I am in my senior year of college, majoring in Animal Science and minoring in Biology. I work two 10 hour night shifts a week to help pay the bills. I have always wanted to go to vet school, but I don't have the grades. My gpa is in the trash due to the lack of motivation I have for school that's gotten increasingly worse over the past year. I extended my graduation to be able to finish all the prerequisites for vet school, but the thought of having to stay here for 6 more months literally makes me want to jump off the planet. I can graduate now, because I technically have all my degree requirements after this quarter, but if I do, my GPA is stuck and I would need to finish my prerequisites elsewhere. I need two classes to meet the minimum requirements to apply to vet school. 

I have thousands of hours working as a vet tech for the past 3 years, but I have really grown to resent my job. I love working with and helping animals, it has always been my passion, but everything that comes with it is soul crushing sometimes. If I can become a vet, a lot of the aspects of the job that I hate won't matter anymore. I guess I just hate the nursing care aspect of the job, and since I recently switched to a new clinic from General Practice to ER, nobody believes I know what I am doing and it is SO frustrating to be just a kennel tech now and treated as a janitor most of the time, even though I have 2.5 years of prior experience. The person who is supposed to be training me constantly talks down to me like I'm stupid, and nobody respects me. All I can do is put my head down and not make waves. Supposedly, I'm supposed to be promoted soon and be evaluated by the end of the month but I have a feeling that may not happen. I want to quit, but it pays super well, the best in the area.

At the beginning of this year, I took a class called scientific diving and I absolutely loved it, and realized I have a passion for marine science, and marine animals. It was like a light switched on. I added my biology minor, and have been trying to take classes in related to that, but being as it's so late in my college career, I have missed so many undergraduate research opportunities and networking opportunities. Every professor I approached to ask about their research told me they didn't have positions available, or I didn't have the right experiences. My other plan after I graduate is to go to grad school and do research related to Environmental Science, Biology, or Marine Biology. This being the case, I feel I have no relevant experiences outside of a few instances of group projects and my scientific diver certification to be able to pursue this, and no good references that can tell programs that ""Yeah this person is qualified to do research at your institution."" And truth is, I'm not. I have no research experience, and have no idea where to get involved since the professors I talk to seem to always say no, and every job position I see requires at least a year of it. I applied for an internship over the winter break that would have given me extensive research experience, but I didn't get it.

An animal science degree at my university mostly teaches you skills in the agriculture and farm industry, which I vehemently don't want to do. I chose this degree because of the way many people tailor it to be able to go to vet school, and have been working towards that my whole college career. But shit happened, and I failed classes, and now I have a trash gpa, and I am not competitive for vet school. Do I even apply anymore? Do I try to go to graduate school instead, since I feel like that is more what I want to do? 

I feel like I have wasted my college career, and don't have the skills or experience or gpa or references to go into higher education. I want to give up and just take my degree and see if I can work entry-level zoo jobs or something, because I sure as hell don't want to keep being a vet tech long term.

I've spoken to my advisor about my options, and he believes I can still get research experience outside of university. I found a job at university of toledo as a field research technician, but again, I don't feel like I have enough experience and am not qualified to apply for it. One of the people (the diving safety officer at cal poly) that I asked to be my references for the job even said he has limited experiences with me and should probably ask someone else. I have no one else! I have no experience. 

I want to give up. I feel like such a failure for wasting my time in this degree. What do I do?

Do I try to get into grad programs? Do I try to continue and raise my gpa with one more quarter left, even though I have no motivation to? do I try to apply to vet school? Do I just take my degree and look for research jobs even though I have no relevant experience?"

I will be graduating next month with a bachelors in computer security tech and have an associates in IT

ive been interviewing and everyone has pushed for me to go to help desk with them or something similar until i interviewed with this company.

They are an MSSP and from the start liked my education and wanted me to come on as an analyst and work towards engineering and offensive security.

it is a huge relief to have a position for when i graduate and continue to learn and develop myself at this job.

since someone asked in the comments ill share what i did to this point

 what i did was keep applying to anything and didnt sell myself short, i knew what i wanted and knew what was within reach and kept going for it. this was huge for me is just getting past the applying for 10 jobs and not hearing back, i probably applied to over 150 jobs since thanskgiving most of them never getting back to me.

for me it was tough to get any interest in anything other then low level support roles or helpdesk since i dont have much experience outside two summers of internships. outside i school i just spent a ton of time working on bettering myself so i know more and to help be familiar with things i know i need to know. i worked two support level internships for two summers which gave me a baseline but only did a little. ive taken classes year round since spring of 20 so getting internships was hard as well as with everything going on in the world so i substituted with homelab work. it helped but deff isnt fully enough to make up for internships. 

i worked on a range of smaller homelab sort of projects, a ton with raspberry pis, looking back these were super helpful as it made me very comfortable working in a terminal and working with some basic network functions like ssh, ftp, opening ports and some simpler home networking. i worked a lot with linux so im not an expert but im definitely comfortable enough to get around with it.

i worked with some virtual machines such and tried to work more with windows server to at least have an idea of active directory, gpos and such that go with it. not being an expert is fine as long as you can at least have an idea of what it does.

i focused a lot on networking in my major, i work in a lab every week which not everyone may have but cisco packet tracer is a great simulator to work with cisco equipment and get familiar building networks and configuring devices.

thats most of what i have done and it seemed to pay off, id just say keep researching into stuff, i got into the loop of youtube videos watching stuff to learn and take it to grow into projects. look for project ideas that interest you or relate to the field you want to pursue so at least it gives you some experience in doing it."

ucnc0i,1,2022-04-26,Should I quit my job for my dream internship?,basilrae,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ucnc0i/should_i_quit_my_job_for_my_dream_internship/,"I understand the title seems like an easy question, but there’s quite a bit of background to this situation so please read through because I am incredibly torn.

I (f18) have worked for a small restaurant in my hometown for over a year. I mean small, there’s never more than 4 workers on duty at a time, there’s 9 of us in total- and one is the owner who works 10 hours everyday to keep the business open. He is a very respectable and kind man, he ensures our schedules are incredibly flexible, we can call out if needed, and is very understanding overall. I worked for the business for 6 months before being promoted to manager. This now made me part of the manager team, which is where the situation gets murky. 

The other two managers are fiancés, we’ll call them A(f20s) and B(m20s). They only have one car between the two of them, which often creates scheduling issues since they cannot be scheduled without one another. They also make the schedules, I am not allowed to be involved in this. We worked together to operate the restaurant up until this last week, where A came up to me and asked if I would be okay with a demotion. When I asked why, she pointed out that I had only been working morning shifts recently and managers should be able to work both morning and night shift. However, I totally am able to do this. My classes are online and I’m available for all shifts every day, and she knows this. When I pointed this out, and reminded her (politely) that she and B make the schedules and have only been working nights lately (hence why I’ve been in the mornings), she backed down and came up with another reason. 
The other reasons included me not training a new worker very well (I hadn’t worked with the new worker recently, they had the last 4 training shifts with him) and me not helping with orders and scheduling (I do make orders, and I’m not allowed to help with scheduling. I literally don’t have access to it). I pointed out again how this didn’t make sense, and A backed down. I was also confused because she and B are managers, like me, can they even demote me?

A couple days ago, though, the schedule read that I was not a manager, but a shift lead. A texted me to come in that night after her shift (I didn’t work that day) to talk and I agreed. A and B also sent out a group chat text to all the workers saying the two of them were now “restaurant’s only managers” and if we had any questions to “ask the managers.” Again, there are only 9 workers and I was the only one that “was” a manager out of all of us. I got a few angry and confused texts from coworkers after this.

When I go in to talk to A and B, they explain that an incident from two days ago led to the demotion (then why were they trying to demote me last week, too?). We had hired a new worker and her application was extremely sketchy, so I told the owner that day that I would be talking to her up front. I spent the whole time asking her about past employment, why she had so many jobs, etc. and ended up finding out she usually quit jobs in a month or two because she got bored. We’re a small business that’s really low on income, and I knew we probably couldn’t afford to pay a temporary worker. In addition, this proved she lied a bit in her interview too. I texted A and B about this, they told the owner, and the next day she was fired. But, apparently I was demoted for socializing too much and the owner specifically noted this incident as the reason. 

On a completely separate note, I was recently admitted into my dream internship. I would be interning under a project manager at a massive laboratory nearby, and I am studying a related engineering field so it is absolutely perfect. I told the lab that I could start in a month or two when classes end, and even though they agreed, they were very clear that they’d love for me to start asap. Honestly, after everything with my workplace, I’m considering just quitting and taking my internship now so I have more time to gain experience. 

However, the internship is unpaid and while I currently make decent side money by tutoring younger kids, it would still severely cut my income (I do live with my parents, but I’m paying off my car and saving up for future rent). I would also hurt the restaurant extremely badly if I quit, I take up about 30% of all shifts and me leaving would probably force A and B to work double shifts multiple times a week. I know two other workers are currently looking for other work, too, so the business might even have to close temporarily if all three of us quit. I respect my boss and coworkers a lot and would feel extremely guilty if I caused this to happen. But the workplace has just been so stressful lately and I feel like I might be being taken advantage of because of my age? 

So Reddit, what do I even do? This is my first chance to take a leap into my future field but I could shut down an entire business in the process. I’ve never made this level of an adult decision before, any input is appreciated.

I can do this invigilated on a locked offline laptop so there’s no way for me to cheat. Therefore, it seems that I should be able to do this.

My uni instead want me to defer my exams to august. However I have an extremely intense internship in this time and will not be able to study and will need to take time off to do the exams. It will also mess with my graduation dates/masters etc.

My uni is implying that it’s too late to have alternative exam arrangements like a laptop. However, they have three/four weeks to organise this so that seems unreasonable to me.

Is there anything I can do to force them to let me use a laptop?

I’ve seen people get a lot of useful advice from this subreddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot.

I will be graduating from UMD next month with a BS in Computer Science and a focus in Data Science with a GPA above 3.0. This past summer I completed an internship in healthcare analytics for a moderately sized consulting company in DC where I used SQL and Tableau. Since then, I have been applying for entry level software engineering roles in the DMV area and have had little to no luck. 

I had a final round for Capital One TDP, but failed because I bombed one of the coding questions, and I had an interview for Geico TDP but did not progress. I went to a CS career fair for my school which felt like it went well, but I didn’t get many leads from that. Besides that, I’ve been applying to various places over time but in total I’ve probably applied to around 30 jobs (not that many, I know).

I reached out to a recruiter from a small government contractor that I had gotten an internship offer from last summer about open full time jobs, and they offered me the same internship for this coming summer after I graduate, since I don’t have any experience in C++. I chose to accept this offer and keep looking for other entry level roles in the mean time since I had nothing else on the table. This offer is for $25 per hour as opposed to $33 per hour that I made last summer, and their entry level roles typically start at $70k yearly which I know is low.

All in all, I just feel hopeless, like I’ll be stranded and unemployed after I graduate and after that internship. I know this was kind of all over the place, but this is where I’m at. 

From a new grad with a CS degree to all of the experienced developers out there, is there any advice you would give me on how to go forward, and not feel like I’ll be letting myself and my family down?"

I'll probably learn web development to make the project mentioned in #4 which should also be a HUGE job. I want to intern at a web development positon so having a project and a solid understanding of it should help with that.

What do you think?
Is this a CRAZY amount of work? Or just a little bit ambitious? Or is it a child's thing for you?

Oh and I also have to live my life, get my driver's license and join a gym this summer haha
Those are not a must though I guess

ucrerg,2,2022-04-26,Is it a concern if a lot of job hires in a company are foreign?,sadnolifemoron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ucrerg/is_it_a_concern_if_a_lot_of_job_hires_in_a/,"So I'm starting a summer internship in like 4 weeks at a fortune 500 company in the US. I just saw the profile list of the interns they hired and a large majority of them are international/ foreign students like me. **Is this a red flag of some sort?** 

It makes no sense to me why such a large majority are not US citizens. I'm concerned that they hired me and the other international students because potential hires would be bound by sponsorship issues and won't leave. A majority of students are also in STEM fields and at least half have masters or higher.

Or should I not be concerned?"
ucrh9d,2,2022-04-26,Chance Me for Film School (Literally Anywhere),jcosully1515,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ucrh9d/chance_me_for_film_school_literally_anywhere/,"Hi, I am currently a junior looking to apply to film schools/programs next year, and I'm very anxious about where I stand as of now. I hope to eventually double major in film and marketing, but I plan to apply solely as a film major. 

I'm looking for  advice on how to spend the next eight-ish months before applications, as well as any other ideas of colleges that seem like a good fit. Due to COVID, my EC's didn't really start ramping up until Junior year, and I have no idea how that'll affect my chances. Any insights/recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 

**Demographics:** White male, MA, public high school (approximately 800 students), upper middle class. 

**Intended Major(s):** 

* Film Production
* Marketing (double major, hopefully)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

* SAT: 1490 (750 English, 740 Math)
* ACT: 33 (36 Reading, 34 English, 31 Math, 30 Science)

I'm taking the SAT again in May, and that will be my last time, regardless of the score.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

* 3.91 UW
* 4.40 W

My school doesn't do class rank, but I am in the top 10% (that's as much as they reveal).

**Coursework:** 

* APUSH (Junior)
* AP Lang (Junior)
* AP Spanish (Senior)
* AP EnviSci (Senior)
* AP Gov (Senior)
* AP Lit (Senior)
* AP Calc AB (I'm still deciding whether or not to take this course next year)

AP classes are only offered during Junior and Senior years at my school. 

**Awards:**

* National Honor Society (2 years)
* National Latin Honor Society (1 year)
* National Spanish Honor Society (1 year)
* Honor roll for every term so far
* I wasn't totally sure where to put this, but a short film I co-wrote and worked on was an official selection for the Drama category at the 2021 All American High School Film Festival. It wasn't specifically nominated for anything, though. 

**Extracurriculars:** 

* Movie Club
   * President (Junior year)
   * Member (Sophomore year)
* Volunteer/Intern at a local television station
   * I film and edit content
   * I'm not lumping this in with my volunteer hours because it's hopefully going to turn into an internship soon after the current seniors leave.
* Theatre
   * Set crew (Junior Year)
* Playwriting Lab
   * 6 weeks (Sophomore year)
   * Ran through a local theatre
* Student Council
   * 3 years (7th grade, Sophomore year, Junior year)
   * I've ran every year since 4th grade, but the positions are extremely competitive, which is weird
* Volunteer hours
   * 30 - 40+ hours
   * Mainly at my town's food cupboard
* Peer Tutor (Junior Year)

This summer, I'll be attending BU's Academy of Media Production for a four week summer program. Senior year, I am going to continue with my current EC's, and I'll also try to run for a leadership position in the National Honor Society. I didn't include this above because it's all hypothetical.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I plan to write my essays this August, and I predict they'll be strong, but not amazing. I have a lot of confidence in my letters of reccomendation; I went to my teachers early and secured the ones that I wanted.

**Schools:** EA and RD (no ED) @ NYU, Emerson, USC, Chapman, UCLA, Columbia, BU, Fordham + any other suggestions; I definitely want to expand my list.

I know this is a mammoth wall of text, but I'm just trying to put everything out there because I am super anxious about my applications, especially after the brutal '26 admission rates. Again, any input is greatly appreciated!"

I am a college student entering my 4th year. I am double majoring in Software Engineering and Business Management, I am also studying for a web communication/design minor. Over the past 2 or so years,  I published two games on Steam with decent results (for someone with no marketing experience/budget). I am also finishing up a game development internship. While my background consists of mostly game development and design, I do have skills in REST API, React, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and some C++. Most of my projects I can showcase, however, are made almost entirely in Unity and C#.  These are projects that hit the real-world market, on Steam, and have viable results. But I'm not sure if they would be good to put on a resume for a software engineering internship or co-op. 

What do you all think?"

I really want to go but i have to pay 50k a year. OSU, Oregon State University, offers me an amazing scholarship where i only have to pay a thousand a year. But it’s not as known as UCSD, and the internship offers at UCSD are better. In addition, UCSD is know for its STEM majors which is what i plan on pursuing. 

My family is very poor and so am I due to family matters. Being 200k in debt by the age of 22 is frightening, and being honest it’s not how i want to start in life. Plus, what if it all fails? i’ll have a lot of debt and no job offers. Also, La Jolla, where UCSD is located, is expensive af.

I was browsing some things online, one thing lead and I ended up going on LinkedIn. I ultimately realized that so many people I know are doing way better than me. I went to a competitive technical high school where everyone takes AP classes and go to top colleges. Basically everyone from my high school has all of these internships, job and school roles, higher GPAs, likely graduating early, and have a lot of skill. I'm a CS major with an IT minor at a pretty good state school going into my third year, but technically a senior from high school credits, I get good grades, and I do have a scholarship. All of this sounds good on paper, but I feel like I don't know much programming or IT knowledge as I should. I feel like a lot of people I know in my school is always 10 steps ahead of me who knows what they are doing. When I working with them in groups for coding projects, I feel like the one listening and that's it. 

But hey, what about the social side of it. Am I doing ok in that? Honestly IDK. I'm in a few clubs where I'm surprisingly very social, I have my group of friends both in school and outside of it. But again, I feel like everyone is doing better than me in that too. I never had a girlfriend, I never get matches on dating apps, and I never really been to a party. I struggled with my weight, and I did lose a lot of weight last year which is good, but 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just overwhelmed. This summer I really going to take time to learn something new related to CS, and I will hang with my friends throughout the summer, but IDK. I wanted to share this with my friends, but I feel embarrassed I feel this way. I'm wondering if anyone else felt this way at one point.  I feel like I work hard from my grades and and nothing to show for it. I apologize if I sound entitled or something and I do know I have a lot of good stuff about me. I'm normally don't think this negative, but I guess that's what happens with finals coming up, and looking at LinkedIn."

I am currently working as a data analyst and data engineer for 1.2 years. Previously, I was a associate project manager for 1.5 years. Total exp: 2.7 years

Since I joined this team, 20 people have left in one year. Among these 20 employees was my team lead, second team lead, and a senior resource. I am a junior data analyst and am learning on the job. I lost my entire team. 

Only 6 remain including me.

My manager is trying to recruit to replace these positions but they are having trouble finding any senior data analyst or data engineers. 

I wanted to take advantage of this situation and use 'I-am-the-only-one-running-your-analytics-division' as leverage to score a leadership position and have an intern or something as my direct reportee. 

Is this risky? Should I go for it? How can I do this? I am looking for a leadership stint to add to my resume for my application to MBA programs.

ucvm3d,22,2022-04-27,NYC or SF?,AppleisOverrated,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ucvm3d/nyc_or_sf/,"hi all,
I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to intern (program management) at a tech company that has multiple offices, and my boss is letting me pick between offices in these two locations. My direct manager is in the midwest while my skip manager (level above direct) is in SF. 

NYC Pros:
- basically never been
- super exciting, don't need a car to get around places
- really was looking forward to nyc lifestyle
- have a place picked out and roommates
- there will be a lot of other interns there

NYC Cons:
- hot and sweaty during the summer
- basically going to the office to be on zoom

SF Pros:
- don't need to pay housing stipend, can live at home
- skip manager wants me there so he can get facetime with me, but I only found out that because I emailed him (original location was NYC)
- Friends from home are there
- Pretty sure there will be good intern connections

SF Cons:
- I mean, basically everything else. I love SF don't get me wrong, but it's not a new place. There's not much more exploring I can do.

other things to consider:

Should I keep applying - is this normal? Or do I have like no chance at getting an intern - maybe try next summer when I graduate? I’ve applied for all the local interns by me that I have seen and then the rest have been remote interns for IT, Security anaylst and cybersecurity. I have not heard one word back. My biggest flaw is that I can’t code, but I’m learning atm. Any advice would be great. Thank you."

It's helped me chart a course for the future. However after looking into a Google support certificate I noticed the duration was 6 months. 

I'm curious if you think time would be better spent going to school exclusively while working. Pursuing Certs, in my case I'm looking at Google support, CompTIA, and then CompTIA securities, then building a career off of those. Or obtaining those certs while taking a small course load at school.

I think either way I'm going to go to school, it seems the opportunities provided via internships are much more valuable then some of the luck it seems you may require to move out of the help desk roles.

This is all on the assumption of an associates degree with potential for a BS later on. 

Right now I'm just at a cross roads if I should pursue certs to break in to the industry earn experience while going to school, ultimately delaying that degree. Or get an associates degree outright

For my internship I was tasked to ""unit test"" a project made by 0 developer (2 physicists fiddling with python).

As you may already imagine, it's a bowl of spaghetti, some files with just a huge main function in it, etc.

Also, we ended up realising what they actually want me to do is DevOps shit (regression testing and integration testing, which I just never learned at uni...)

For now they ""allow"" me to unit test (since that's originally my internship task), but I ""have"" to ""convince"" them it's useful.

Sad thing is I have no idea how to unit test most of this uh **messy** code.

They sound like they hate the very idea of OOP (they hired a dude last year who tried to untangle the mess and apply OOP and it sounds like he didn't manage to convince them), and have never unit tested without OOP (even less so on such big functions, with sometimes 20 return values and 20 arguments)

So my question: how would *you* go about it ?

I mean that literally - I believe, and to a larger degree, I hope, that this is all useless information.

However, I have helped close to three dozen friends go from getting nearly zero interviews or even responses, to getting them all the time, just by... get ready for it... this one simple trick.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your primary strategy for applying to jobs is by going to [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), [monster.com](https://monster.com), [jobs.linkedin.com](https://jobs.linkedin.com) \- etc, and hitting submit on an application, then I am so happy to inform you that you're just doing this wrong. I have applied to many jobs this way, and I have sparingly seen a response. Why? Because I'm a shithead, and no one wants to hire a shithead.

So, what did I do instead, and what did all my other shithead friends do instead?

# What The Hell To Do Instead

HAVE A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD

I have seen so many resumes from newgrads and junior engineers with the most *blegh* looking resumes. I am not talking content here - by now, I hope you know how to make your resume sound, and this is not going to be a guide on how to make your resume *sound* good. But for the love of God, if you're making your resume on microsoft word, do yourself a favor and [make yourself a resume on overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) Or whatever you want. Make it look good. Overleaf makes it hella easy, especially if you're a developer. Don't know LaTeX? Neither do I, and I got by just fine, and, remember, I'm a shithead. You can figure it out, I promise.

Okay, have a nice looking resume? Good.

&amp;#x200B;

# Use LinkedIn to Contact People. Seriously.

I have never, ever, *ever*, sent an application randomly through one of those crap-chute websites and expected to ever hear anything back. And guess what? Lo and behold, I nearly never hear back. So, here's what I do.

Let's say I want to apply to a Spotify job. I'll go to Spotify's ""careers at spotify"" page, and look for two, three maximum, roles that sound right for me. Then, I go on [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) and search ""Spotify"" and land on their company page. You should see something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/uoIPIXH).

Then, I click on the [People](https://imgur.com/a/ZBT5oOg) tab.

Then, I look at the [filters that are immediately available.](https://imgur.com/a/TQRLKxk)

And I apply some filters!

You want people in Engineering. You want people who went to your college. You want people who studied what you studied. You want people who are first, second, or even third connections. Just add as many filters as *you* can. The more related they are to you, the better!

Then, start mass-adding people that clear the filters. If they are already a connection - great, send them a message. If they went to your school (this is very helpful) - great, send them a message. If they have your first name - great, send them a message.

If they share fuck-all with you, great, send them a message!

But they have to accept your connection first, of course, if you don't have Linkedin premium. A lot of them will. Some of them won't. Whatever, doesn't matter. You really just want 1-3 people.

Once you have at least one person accept your connection request, send them a message! You don't want more than a paragraph. 1-2 sentences telling them why you are messaging them, 1-2 sentences introducing yourself, and 1-2 sentences to just shoot the shit. Something like:

""Hey, my name is Texzone, and I am messaging you because I am interested in a job at Spotify. These roles I have sent below seem like a great fit for me (send roles after sending the intro message), and, I would love if you could refer me. I am a newgrad interested in backend development with a focus in data engineering, and I have some experience under my belt that I think would be beneficial to Spotify. \[insert line about your qualifications; seriously, Keep It Simple, Stupid\]. Thank you so much for everything, and have a great day!""

That's it.

""*But* u/texzone\*, that's so annoying! I'm surely harassing them by doing this!""\*

You idiot. You know, if they refer you and you get accepted, most companies have a bonus that they offer the employee! It ranges anywhere from 2k-10k. And all they have to do is drag-and-drop your resume on some shitty internal portal, then continue picking their nose while watching whatever tiktok nonsense they were watching when you messaged them.

Even if they don't get any money out of it, people like helping other people. Really, it's true. They do.

And, with a referral, you are almost *guaranteed* an interview if you:

1. Have a clean looking resume and it sounds good.
2. You are applying to a role that matches your background/experience, at least loosely.
3. That's it.
4. Yeah that's really it.
5. I swear.

Easy. I have applied to dozens upon dozens of jobs this way, and I have gotten interviews at nearly every single damn one. My resume isnt amazing. My experience isn't way out there. My friends? A lot of them had a clean looking resume, but had shit-all for experience. But they all got interviews as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sharing this because I am forced to believe people aren't doing this, and are instead hitting submit on some portal. This is by far the worst god damn way to ever apply *anywhere* nowadays. Unless your resume is filled with jargon, years of experience, and a sprinkle of FAANG, forget this ever being a smart way to apply to jobs.

So, that's how I, a shithead, have gotten over a hundred (I'm seriously not kidding) interviews over three cycles of job hunts that lasted about 3-5 months each. I applied once when I graduated, once during COVID, and just finished a job hunt right now.

I *now* have some impressive stuff on my resume, thankfully. I look less and less like a shithead, and more like a professional - much to the dismay of the world - and I *still* don't ever hear back (rarely) from applying to jobs ""normally."" I still do apply normally - I'll send out applications every month or so, even when I'm working, so I can keep interviewing and stay ontop of my interviewing game. But from, say, 50 applications I send out, I'll maybe hear one  response.

But when I apply the way I described above? If the person delivered, and referred me, I never *don't* hear back. Neither do my friends. And I will almost always find someone to refer me. So... yeah, I hope this helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I guess this may not work for super small startups. Whatever.

# FAQs

1. Is this method something you would recommend for internships?
   1. No, not really - this method is something that I strongly encourage for full time jobs. Internships, co-ops, etc - those are a different beast and I know nothing about that. A college internship? ...Maybe. A High school one? ...Unlikely.
2. ***AM I SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT MY APPLICATION BEFORE OR AFTER THEY REFER ME***
   1. ***VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH AFTER! DONT APPLY, LET THEM APPLY FOR YOU!*** If you apply before they refer you, well, then, you applied, and they can no longer refer you. So don't apply unless they explicitly tell you to do so.
3. Am I supposed to contact recruiters?
   1. Yes. They are excellent. Yes, do contact them. But honestly I've just never really had much luck with them.
4. Do I attach my resume unprompted?
   1. Up to you really. I usually don't. But you can. Especially if u like it

# A Man Of My Word. Passing it Forward. All that Goof Stuff.

I work for Amazon. Anyone that wants a referral, let me know. But, as I eluded to in my post, I just finished my job hunt recently. I think I need about a month before I can refer people? I'll keep your info with me and refer you as soon as I can get do it.

So far all I ever did during my gap year was some online courses (MOOCs such as the Harvard CS50 and Stanford Machine Learning), competed in a hackathon, participated in a summer school program, and also worked on some personal projects.
The above might sound really good but one key activity is missing - and that is work experience. The problem is, in my country it is quite difficult to find an internship within CS or IT if I’m not currently enrolled in university. I did try applying for internships anyways but I only received one offer from a local startup - but it was unpaid, so i rejected it (looking back maybe I should’ve just accepted the offer lol)

So my question is: How much does the lack of CS work experience during a gap year of education hinder you from getting jobs at like, FAANG for example in the future? Keep in mind I did a lot of personal projects and a hackathon and also some online courses to compensate for it (as listed above). Would these be enough? Will my application to future jobs be much less competitive?

EDIT: adding a note here ... it is probably quite okay to skip the full text...

i'm a junior year in college, biology-cs double major. i'd been heading towards pre-med/PA but decided to finally switch (if my work could contribute to advances in public health or health science that would be ideal). this switch means that the summer research position i currently have lined up at a genetics lab does not really feel like a good use of my time so i would like to land a CS internship instead. my overall goal for the next two years is to land a job fresh out of college and find my own place to live, hopefully in socal where my family and SO live.

i think i have some significant challenges in my internship search:

* portfolio. my ""projects"" right now consist of two ML research projects that i did in my two ML courses, and it was basically applying ML and comparing/tuning models for higher accuracy. no personal projects outside of class
* interview skills. i know that leetcode and the technical interview is common, but i don't have any practice under my belt at the moment.
* skills. i do well in my courses and the assignments we get, but many intern postings i've seen seem to be looking for python/etc. and something else like SQL/Ruby/etc.
* timeline. this is the most challenging aspect. obviously, it's very late to try finding a new internship at this point, and lacking a solid portfolio and interview practice in this moment doesn't help.

additionally, my summer internship at the genetics lab has a decent stipend - most paid internships could probably match it but i'm not sure i'll be able to land one. this is important to me as a low-income student, but also i think i can escape existential duress for a year's time without the stipend if skipping the genetics lab and focusing on CS would be better moving forward from here. on the other hand, i wonder if i should just hold onto it, never mind a summer cs internship, and handle projects and interview prep on the side for a proper job (not internship) search later in the fall.

i haven't looked deeply into internships during the school year yet, so i suppose another option might be to squeeze in an internship then, though i don't know how that timeline fits with the job search timeline -- i.e., i don't know if i'll have much to showcase by the time i'm submitting job applications this way.

another alternative would be to stay in the genetics lab and try to get clearance from the PI and the scholarship donors behind the stipend to quit the wet-lab stuff and instead update/improve their MATLAB scripts for analyzing DNA sequencing (ChIP) data (maybe use python instead? how could i make it a more complete project?)

any advice would be appreciated! i don't want to be the doomsday kid and i want to believe i'll be okay eventually, i.e., i'll get some job out of college, hopefully in socal, that pays the bills and will be the start of a decent CS career (but also... reality checks are very, very welcome. i'm already mentally bracing for some forced compromises down the road). but naturally, i'd like to be informed about the best next steps ...

sorry about the length of this post, and thank you for your time!"

It’s moments like this you really start to feel the way life has fucked you. Hard. Like this lovely concrete floor. Three weeks ago I was just a simple biologist going to work. And what a nice job I had. Comfy lab, okay reheated food, soft bed, lovely company and a wonderful new universe full of life and wonder. Oh sweet summer child. You just had to get worked up and kick the shit out of a moron who thought it was a good idea to mug you. Okay yes I can see why he didn’t think I would fight back. But being new to the universe and not even reading the Alliance handbook of rules all the way through, I honestly didn’t know that self-defense was apparently not legal without a permit… the fuck needs a permit to fight back, and as well needs a VISIBLE badge to make those without one a clear target. Who even thought of that idea? Who would approve of article number 85? 
‘To inflict harm on another sanities without being permitted by a state official is a criminal offense and should be given the same treatment as any other.’ No matter who started it. Dear good it’s just like preschool all over again. Guess it's like the reversed second amendment and even counts unarmed fighting.

(Wait has friend/stalker#1 talked this whole time?)

“Will’eam!? Will’eam!? Oh wow that’s not good WILL’EAM!”

“I can’t move, what is it?” Still on the ground looking at we'll... ground I ask ‘friend’ why he/she was panicking 

“Guards are coming! AND the warden!” 

(oh come on)

I still haven’t seen the warden yet. Only time I got the chance was yesterday when I arrived, so just like now all my vision goes directly to concrete.

“Well well well William tripping hazard presume?” Thats the warden alright. Only one who’s pronounced my name right since I was sent here. 1 out of 2 isn’t that bad.

“Warden. Did you do this or was it just your peace off garbage human handicap suit malfunctioning?” I asked her in the most passive-aggressive voice i could muster.

“Human handicap suit huh? Good name. Do mind if I steal it?” She’s toying with me.

“Stilling from a prisoner, oh how ironic.” 

“It would be if you were in for theft, like that fish over there trying to blend in with the wall.” 

“How did…” Friend was cut off by a sound of a hard impact.

“Urhhf” I then sense a body land next to me.

“You bastards! Steve you okey?” I just go back to calling friend Steve again.

“S-s-Steve’s not my oh ow, r-r-real name.” At least they are conscious. But sounds like they’re breathing through a straw.

“I saw you transform in plan sight, plus you still have your orange jumpsuit.” Warden says matter-of-factly.

“Why are you doing this, surely this is braking the rules, this is abuse of power.”

I try to move my body but I’m still frozen and I can’t see ether.

“Abuse of power? Hun why have power if you’re not going to use it, your friend’s and your life belong to me now. Ain’t no one gonna tell me of for disciplining my own prisoners.” Her voice is even worse now than before. Ugh my poor ears.

“Well we should get on with it!” One of the guards said.

“See that you do… and yes William we can make you a living statue at will.

“Wha!? Ouf” suddenly I got lifted off the ground and is being transferred Somewhere.

“Gee his heavy!” a familiar croaking voice exclaimed. The Prazat from the other day!? 

“Not that heavy.” Another familiar voice said, more calmer than the other… the Yerrom? 

“Att least I don’t have to wait for his slow ass this time! What is he a Pungala or something!?” Pungala water avian like a penguin if there 4 feet and rainbow coloured. Actually most things from the Prazat home world was rainbow coloured. Including the trees, which make pride flags perfect camouflage. 

“Trust me I’m not…” they dropped me.
(How many more times?)

“Shit he’s awake”

“I was clearly never unconscious!” I say irritatedly.

“I just talked to the warden! I mean seriously.” 

“Forgive my friend he is new here” 

“Well I’m newer so for the love of god  let me out of my cage…please”

“Okay sure”
——//——



“What?” Are they really letting me out?

“Kacadri be ready to shoot If he try’s anything .” The Yerrom said to the Prazat, Kacadri apparently.

(Great the intern with a gun is responsible for shooting me.)

“Got it sarge!” Kacadri answers and I get pealed.

And just like that my movements are free at last, it feels like heaven I can’t resist stretching my arms over my head.

“DON’T MOVE! Kacadri shout/squawks.

“Just stretching.” I answer like no one was aiming a gun at me.

“Calm down Kacadri. It makes sense, that he was crammed in there for over a day must have been hard.” Im stating to like ‘sarge’.

“Why let me out of the torture exo? And where are we? I ask genuinely curious.

“Maintenance. And we’re in the death worlders hygiene facility. I'm sergeant Pru by the way.”

“Death worlders, plural? Are there any other here?” I ask while looking around. In response Kacadri tightens his grip. 

“Just you. Feel free to do… what ever humans do to freshen up.” Pru says while putting a hand on his apprentice gun lowering it.

“Great I would literally kill for a shower!”

And now i have two guns in my face.

——//——

Having to get in my now probably maintained HHS was a little heart breaking. (At least I smell better) the ‘death worlders showers’ was just like any other communal shower. Except of course the guards and it was nice and clean, minus one plus one. So overall a pretty decent price.

“Will’eam Will’eam!” And here comes friend/stalker#1.

“Will’eam I was so worried.”

“My name is not Will’eam it’s William Brakes.”

“That’s what I said”

“No you ugh. Okay wats is your name anyway? I gave up on correcting them again. (For being a octopus you really have a thick skull.)

“It’s Blek!”

(Finally a real name)

“So Blek… you got dick or not?”

”… I beg your pardon”

I don't post often on reddit and I hope this is the right place to post this. I thought I would come on to ask the community if they have any insight on my situation. So I am about to finish college with my bachelor's in psychology this May and recently got an internship at a staffing firm as a recruiter for the upcoming summer. I thought it would be a good way to get into HR as I have been thinking HR might be something I could enjoy and the money is good and it's very stable. All through college I was leaning more on going into the healthcare field and specifically into occupational therapy assisting. I applied to a program near me kind of on a whim because I didn't think I had the points to get accepted but I just wanted to see. They ended up contacting me saying that they were going to give me points for my in progress bachelors degree which gave me a good chunk of extra points and I just found out that I got accepted. 

I'm conflicted because I have been in school for a long time already (I graduated high school in 2012 and have been in some kind of college ever since) so I have a good amount of debt already, nothing crazy but I would like to start chipping away at it. This program would add another $10,000 to that and I probably wouldn't be able to work much.

It's also another 2 years of schooling including the summer when I already feel very burnt out from school.

BUT I never pictured myself working an office job, I always enjoy jobs where I am on my feet and moving around and where the day-to-day is different. I also get a great deal of satisfaction from helping people that are having trouble. I volunteered a lot at a pediatric therapy center where I got to see occupational therapy first hand and absolutely loved it.

The money is better in HR and there is room for growth. With OTA, you could eventually become a clinic director but it would be unlikely in a lot of situations so you are basically always going to be just an OTA unless you decide to go back to school for a masters in OT. 

So do i pick the career that is easy and mundane where the money is good and the job is stable but I might be bored out of my mind, or do I pick the career that requires more schooling and more debt and less advancement but could make me happier and more fulfilled??

Passion or money???

IM BEYOND CONFLICTED!"

hopefully this is the right sub, but since I'm in an engineering field, maybe you can help me. :)

Since english is not my native language, I'm not sure if I can express my problem correctly, but let me try to explain it a little bit: While working (e.g. in internships) or while writing my thesis or even in general life, I notice that I sometimes lack initiative and the ability to think outside of the box. So let's say I get a task for work, that I have to do, then I usually do this task and I usually do it okay, in a pretty straight-forward way, but I'm unable to think of any additional things to do that are related to the task.

 I noticed this the last time I did a project with another student working at the same company. We had a clearly defined task, so I would have only done what we had been asked for, but she was so full of ideas, what else would be useful for the whole topic, what questions would come up that we could already investigate, anticipating the next steps...so we ended up doing more than just the basic things we had to do, and we (she) received some good feedback for this.

Obviously, this is an opportunity to make a good impression with supervisors for work or while writing a thesis, but somehow I'm not very good at  and this is something that I really want to change about myself, because I think that this is a useful personality trait, that makes someone easy to work with. Also when it comes to studying, I guess that it is useful to not just learn things by heart, but to ask further questions and try to understand things on a deeper level. 

I feel like I can learn stuff, and if somebody teaches me something, I'm good at replicating, but asking critical question and thinking further than what I've been taught, is not one of my strengths. I hope you get what I mean. 

So, basically, I wonder if some of you have the same experience and hopefully have some tips to improve that?"

I'm 16M, turning 17 in a little over a month, I guess I would be considered a High school Junior now.

My parents are conservative and **extremely** religious. I live in California, when I finished 5th grade my parents decided they didn't like the more progressive teaching of public schools but couldn't afford private school. So on the legal side they created a private institution and have been homeschooling me.

Or at least they would have if they taught anything. In California, private institutions don't have to report very much back to the state about what the school does. My parents pretty quickly decided to take advantage of this and have done basically zero teaching of any kind other than their religious teaching.

My parents refuse to discuss the future with me in any way. The best I get is that someday they want to go into ministry and teach their religion to the world, and that they have decided my purpose is to help them with it. Except I don't want to have anything to do with their politics, and I especially don't want to have anything to do with their religion. But I don't even want to think what they would do if I told them that.

So essentially I just sit in my room day after day, trying my best to learn on my own, and hiding my passions from my parents because they have expressed hatred for them (Secular music &amp; music production, graphic design, video games, Anime, etc). Which is easier said then done when your ""room"" is really just a loft with no door and a missing wall. The only interest I've been able to express to my parents if my fondness of computer programming, but while I like it, its very hard to know how to grow and what direction to take it without formal guidance of some kind. My parents only see it as a way I can help make religious apps for their ministry. I'm not sure what else I'd want to do though as I haven't gotten to try much else.

I have my one friend that I've intermittently kept in contact with since elementary ask my about my collage plans recently. I don't even know where to begin with that, I'm don't think I'm even close to getting a Ged, I don't even know where to begin with collage.

I've never been taught, or given the chance to figure out how to be a functioning human, much less an adult. About 3 years ago my dad (the only one in the family who worked) quit his job because both my parents claim to have heard from God that they need to double down on spending time reading the bible to better prepare for ministry. As you could have guessed nothing has happened. And we've been financially coasting since then.

About a year and half ago, the remaining funds basically ran and the only reason We're not on the street is that our extremely sympathetic and partially religious neighbor/landlord has dropped all rent fees and provides food. (This has created a whole other tension that I'm not going get into, all I can say is that I feel bad for her (the landlord))

Knowing my situation my friend from elementary (also 16M) (who now has a pretty high GPA and has recently been offered an internship at Boeing), has offered once we both turn 18 for me to move into an apartment with him while he tutors me so that I can get a Ged, and then try to figure out community collage and/or a job. He seems like a genuinely wants to help, but the last thing I want is to be a burden or to drag him or anyone else down in any way.

I haven't told anyone this, but this whole situation has just brought a crippling anxiety over everything related to my future (I physically start shaking uncontrollably). Recently I've begun doing what I can best describe as maladaptive daydreaming as what I think is a form of mental escape. I've been thinking about ending it all, but I can't tell my parents that or I'd just get yelled at and told that I'll go to hell and that I just need to be more connected to God. I don't know how my friend would respond, I've been trying not to talk about it with him too much because I don't want to bother him further.

Am I over reacting? Am I just being angsty? I don't think I would describe my parents as abusive exactly. If I had any intelligence I probably would have realized I should have just been asking for help years ago. I know there are people out there that are in worse, more physically dangerous situations. I know it's pathetic, I just don't know what to do anymore or who to talk to, but I also don't want to be in anyone's way.

Thank you for your time"
ud8dcb,9,2022-04-27,My first positive experience with a psychiatrist!,itsgonnabe_mae,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ud8dcb/my_first_positive_experience_with_a_psychiatrist/,"I just wanted to get this out there for my own reflection and also possibly to give people hope who might be struggling with really shitty healthcare providers. There are a lot of dud psychiatrists out there, but their incompetence is not a reflection of your validity or worth. And there are some good ones! I hope everyone can experience the level of care that I finally found.

**PAST BAD EXPERIENCES**

As a teenager I was not diagnosed with ADHD because it was the early 00's I was a girl and my symptoms didn't look like doctors thought ADHD should back then? Despite my brother being diagnosed with ADHD years prior, they said I had depression and tried to put me on Welbutrin, my parents weren't that on board for depression meds so I never took them and that was that. I miraculously graduated from undergrad (with a 1.88 GPA) and through hard work, a few different jobs and a lot of luck/privilege I eventually found myself in grad school.

Part way through grad school I was REALLY struggling for obvious reasons, and started seeing a therapist who repeatedly suggested I get assessed for ADHD despite my resistance. I went to a psychiatrist at the university and was met with extreme suspicion for asking about ADHD. She ignored everything I told her, deterred me from getting assessed by telling me that it would cost 1000$ not covered by insurance, and put me on Welbutrin for depression instead. The Welbutrin helped with the depression, which I did have partly as a result of feeling like a constant failure. But it didn't help with my focus, motivation, or general executive function at all. Finally I decided to bite the bullet and pay the exorbitant fee for ADHD assessment because I was desperate and on the verge of giving up my career goals. It turned out to only cost 200$ and they had a payment plan. 

The psychiatrist at the learning disability center where I got assessed determined that I have ADHD-PI, and finally I was able to get medication from the suspicious psych. But for the 3 years she was prescribing it to me she was constantly for various reasons threatening to ""cut me off"". The most upsetting version of this was that she would weigh me at the beginning of every appointment, chastise me for being underweight, and threaten that if I dropped below a certain weight she would stop prescribing me Adderall. I've been thin my whole life, its something that I'm pretty self-conscious about. I've always struggled with appetite and honestly my ADHD makes it really hard to feed myself consistently. My relationship with food is generally not good. I tried to switch psychs because of this adversarial relationship but she was only one of two at the university, the other one wouldn't see me bc they don't take each other's patients, and insurance made it really hard to switch to someone out of the university health center. This threat of cutting me off also was frustrating because from the first appointment with this doctor I made it clear that medication was my LAST resort, I wanted to try non-stimulant medication if possible, and I was coming to her for this because after 27 years I couldn't do it on my own any more. So being treated like I was drug seeking felt like a slap in the face.

Last year I moved to a new state for a job and have been rationing the remainder of my Adderall stash to try and get by without a script. (my last psych would always remind me that when I graduated she wouldn't prescribe for me anymore, and I was really nervous about not having any between graduation and a new provider, so I slightly stockpiled) I kept trying to find a psych but honestly it was stressing me out and every little roadblock I came across caused me to procrastinate harder. I finally asked a friend who works at a mental health clinic to help me find someone bc it wasn't happening with just me responsible, and they sent me a clinic where I could see an intern for medication management. I already had the assessment done elsewhere so I was hoping that would transfer, but when I showed up to the appointment I could physically feel the stress and anxiety in my body of dealing with psychiatrists. My chest tightened up and I was on edge, ready to have to argue, defend myself, and justify. I was especially nervous because my request for the records transfer hadn't gone through yet, and I didn't want to look like I was lying or drug-seeking.

**THE GOOD PART!!!**

This psychiatrist was amazing!!!! It was a resident/intern doctor and her supervisor in the initial assessment (both women). At the beginning of the appointment she laid out what it was going to look like, what each of their roles were in my treatment, etc. There was a tray with fidget toys next to the couch that let me fidget comfortably so I could think more clearly. She asked sincere, non-suspicious questions about what my concerns were, how I saw my symptoms, what has worked for me in the past etc. They totally agreed that gender probably played a role in me not being diagnosed when I was younger. 

At the end the supervisor jumped in with a few clarifying questions, including asking me if I agree with the assessment of ADHD-PI. At the time of my diagnoses I guess I did agree, but since then people close to me have pointed out how much I fidget constantly. Because of that I have suspected that my flavor of hyperactivity probably didn't fit classical symptoms, and so the (not to make it all about gender buuuttt....) male doctor who assessed me probably didn't catch my hyperactivity. She fully agreed and said that even just in that hour-long intake appointment it was clear to her that I was both inattentive and hyperactive. Not that it makes much of a difference in treatment, but it just felt so good that she was actually paying attention and had a deep enough understanding of different ADHD presentations to really get me!!! She also gave me some great leads on types of therapy and subjects to bring up with a therapist about my relationship with food, she made some very astute and quippy remarks about what I had shared with them about my family which were funny and on the nose.

It all just felt very thorough, safe, and validating. When we were going over medication they were primarily concerned with my opinion and experience about what works for me, and not at all about micromanaging the controlled substance to cover their own asses. Overall it was a very healing psychiatric experience, just the absence of suspicion and doubt alone was a relief, but on top of that I felt like I was actually cared for, trusted, and believed. I've been struggling a lot at my new job and working from home a lot + not having medication means my productivity and focus are extremely low. Now I'm feeling hopeful that with regular medication again I'll be able to accomplish the things I want to and really meet my goals! I finished my PhD very strong, feeling proud of my work and not having done everything half-assed or last minute. That was the first major thing I have ever finished so successfully, it was a huge boost to my self-confidence and I definitely attribute part of that success to having my ADHD treated and acknowledged. Now that I'm back on track with treatment I'm feeling excited about my career again and generally way more optimistic! I hope you all can get the care you deserve someday too."

ud9bvb,2,2022-04-27,Options for help more frequent than weekly therapy,MagnusVesper,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ud9bvb/options_for_help_more_frequent_than_weekly_therapy/,"I'm 24, male, and living in the US (specifically Minnesota).

For some background, I have clinical depression, clinical anxiety, adhd, and minor epilepsy (but haven't had a seizure in 8 years). I also may have autism and/or bipolar disorder but haven't been diagnosed.   
Currently having a really hard time and don't think the weekly therapy I set up is going to be enough. What kind of options are there for more aggressive/frequent help? At this point, I'm willing to live in some facility 24/7 if it would help (but I've heard to many horror stories, that I'm afraid I'd come out worse.)

There are a lot of things impeding my life now, anxiety, depression, memory loss, constant intrusive thoughts of suicide. But the most urgent think I think are attention issues. I just can't focus. It's not getting distracted or my mind wandering off. It's like my mind literally shuts down when I try to do things. I try to focus and just stop, no thoughts, no feelings. It's more extreme than just feeling nothing or detached, my mind just doesn't exist. It happens more often when it's something boring, but it still happens doing things I enjoy. Sometimes, I'll stand up to go somewhere and realize I stopped and stood motionless for 15 minutes without noticing. It's like I just didn't exist for the period and my mind skipped ahead. I don't know what it is or how to fix it. It happens independently of how much I sleep too. It's also happened through all the combination of drugs I've tried in the past few years. The adderall I'm on seems to help with it somewhat and improves my mood. (And for anyone worried about that, I'm very confident that I'm not addicted. I can forget to take it and don't crave it. I don't have any urge to take more than necessary. It doesn't feel like it's filling any void to me. And I want to be better not feel better, so using any drugs for recreation has no appeal to me.)

The rest of this is mostly venting. The previous paragraph is what I really want to address asap.

Here's a quick summary of my situation: I graduated university with a Computer Science degree in summer of 2020. I got a not too related internship (Data Analysis) which I left after a few months for a Tech Support role that promised to promote me to developer in a few months (which my contract stated). But I lost that in December before the promotion. I lost the position for poor performance. I got so much anxiety over the thought of bothering coworkers for help that I never learned enough to really do my job.  
Since then, I've been living with my parents struggling to find jobs. They're getting increasingly fed up with me and every conversation with them is stressful. Even when I've been really productive on a day, they'll remind me of all the stuff I have to do every other day, giving me an anxiety attack. (I've talked to them about that, and they think I'm being unreasonable to ask them to tone it down.) There's always more to do. I don't care about getting positive reinforcement, I just want them to stop talking. I don't eat breakfast or lunch most days, because I feel more drained from talking to them than I do from being starving.  
My partner of 2 years also broke up with me a few months before I lost my job, which hit me hard. While I'm over them, I still haven't learned to deal with the loss of my plans for the future. Even if the attention problems stop, I can't imagine a scenario that makes me satisfied in life. I'm barely holding onto the rational part of my brain telling me that I should keep giving living a chance. Every anxiety-inducing conversation with my parents kills more of it off."
ud9vi7,1,2022-04-27,Possible leasing scam with an apartment? - Looking for Advice,Big_Eggplant2956,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ud9vi7/possible_leasing_scam_with_an_apartment_looking/,"I have a software engineering internship over the summer in Michigan (in which I am travelling to). To narrow down costs, I decided to sublease an apartment at a nearby University.

Essentially, the deal between the sub-lessor and I was that I would pay $750 per month plus 40 dollars in utilities. The sub-lessor originally pays $1k + $40 utilities to the apartment complex per month.

After the sub-lessor had talked to the leasing office, it was determined that the payments would still go to the sub-lessor's account, and I would pay the sub-lessor, then the sub-lessor handles the payments.

It's been about a week since me and the sub-lessor had signed our personal agreements essentially saying that they will sublease the room to me for $750 per month plus the utility fees from May 13th to August 19th. The apartment complex had let me know that I would need to create an account with them and submit my application for a **lease.** Since the sub-lessor had confirmed this themselves with the leasing office, I had went ahead and done so. I received an email on 4/25/2022 saying that the leasing documents were ready to be signed and my application had been approved.

Now here is where things become an issue. The leasing document states the following:

    Security Deposit: $250
    
    Annual administrative fee: $150
    
    Application fee: $100
    
    Convenience Fee: $259 
    
    Total amount owed under lease term: $2610.29
    
    COMMENCEMENT DATE:  12:00pm on 05/13/2022
    
    LEASE EXPIRATION DATE: 12:00pm on 07/31/2022

So, as can be seen, the contract I am signing for says my lease expiration date is going to be on the 31st of July, when I meant to stay there until August 19th. So naturally, I had also noticed that the fees were in detail on the contract which felt odd because technically I was supposed to pay the sub-lessor the amounts. I had emailed the leasing office and they let me know that my sub-lessor requested another term with them, so those details can be filled in later. To be more exact, these are the two questions I asked vs the response I received:

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

&amp;#x200B;

    So, I had noticed an issue with the lease documents, and I thought the dates were communicated when {sub-lessor's name} had contacted you guys. So, I only had two options when selecting a date on the website and was not able to choose a further date. So, the time of residency that {sub-lessor's name} and I had agreed on was from around May 3rd to August 19th, but I will be having my official move in day on May 13th due to school. The current lease document says 7/31/2022 as the expiration date, but the commencement date is correct. Note that August 19th is my last day of work, so I would technically be moving out late at night on the 19th, and it would be fine to be extended to the 20th if needed be. I would also like to confirm that the payment charges are going to {sub-lessor's name} and he can pay them off from his portal, and then I just pay {sub-lessor's name} correct? This is important information because the lease is situated as if it was a direct lease and does not appear to be situated accordingly for a sublease.

Reply I received:

    {sub-lessor's name} current lease ends 7/31. He did renew and extend for the Fall, but you cant technically relet two separate leases at the same time. If you have an agreement to stay until later in August, thats fine, I can adjust the dates when I send the sublease form which will detail you taking {sub-lessor's name} room specifically for the Summer.
    
    Sent from my iPhone

So at this point the leasing office had completely ignored my other question, so I asked again:

    Okay sounds good, and are you able to confirm the later question if the payments for my lease would be sent to {sub-lessor's name} accounts and then I just pay {sub-lessor's name}?

in which they responded:

    Youll pay on your own account
    
    Sent from my iPhone

This is the part right here that rose a red flag for me as both me and the sub-lessor were convinced and confirmed with the leasing office at the time that we would be paying through his account, but with the way they are situating the lease and not just giving me a subleasing contract, it feels as if they are trying to get me to sign the contract and put me in another room, or potentially even charge the sub-lessor's account while also charging mine since we would both be under contracts. Regardless, I want to play it safe and make sure I am not signing myself into a trap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note is that the leasing document is the exact same one they would give to a normal tenant, and they are having me sign that. I'm not sure how to approach this legally as it's a ""necessary step"" before the leasing office sends in the subleasing form without potentially screwing over both myself and the sub-lessor. The document itself is 30 pages, and is a full lease agreement as if I was planning to get a new room and not sublease my sub-lessor's room. I'm hoping for some advice on how I can get this situated to make sure everything is as wanted (me taking over the sub-lessor's room, and only one of us paying the full amount)."

uddny4,67,2022-04-27,ASUCI allowed an outside organization to increase EVERY students tuition and is doing nothing to stop them from doing further tuition increases,Aggravating-Injury45,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/uddny4/asuci_allowed_an_outside_organization_to_increase/,"*TLDR*

I am making this post to urge students to please attend the Senate meeting **this Thursday, April 28th, at 5 pm** with this zoom link[ https://uci.zoom.us/j/97062458514](https://uci.zoom.us/j/97062458514) and ask the senators during public comment to vote to leave UCSA - a negligent and money hungry organization that secretly increased tuition on all UCI students to increase their own salaries and has been nothing but abusing their power for decades.

*What is UCSA?*

UCI and every other UC is part of an organization called UCSA (University of California Student Association). UCSA claims that they are a group that lobbies for student interests but they virtually do nothing except take credit for the accomplishments of other organizations no matter their level of involvement in said project. Last year without consulting the student body whatsoever, UCSA went to the UC Reagents and claimed that all students are ok with a $9 fee that will go straight into the pockets of UCSA. This fee is going to be in place for the next 25 years where we will be paying an organization who historically has **never** cared about representing the interests of UCI. They are an organization that only caters to UCLA and UC Berkeley and have never worked closely with us. UCR is also in the process of leaving UCSA.

*What can be done?*

Unfortunately, I have tried talking to countless people within ASUCI to remove the fee but they all just say it's ""policy"" and that they can't do anything about (honestly I dont know what I expected from ASUCI). So the fee apparently is set in stone. **However,** there is a vote taking place **this Thursday, April 28th,** where the ASUCI Senate are voting to leave UCSA to prevent them from enacting any further tuition increases. There needs to be a flood of students urging the ASUCI Senate to vote to leave because UCSA will continue to increase tuition for their own benefit again in the future.

*Background*

This vote was originally taken in the beginning of the year but the External Vice President's (EVP) office (the office who is able to go see Gavin Newsom if ASUCI stays in UCSA) mobilized their entire office of interns and commissioner to flood public comment and urge the ASUCI Senate to stay in UCSA. They eventually came to an agreement to stay in UCSA and to put out a **survey,** asking students whether they would like to stay or not. But in true ASUCI fashion, their incompetence led to the survey never being released. Now, an entire school year later, EVP is arguing that ""since the survey never went out we don't know whether or not the students want to stay or not"". They also agreed to wait and see if UCSA will make any significant changes to better cater to UCI students but again they failed with UCSA visiting UCI for the first time just last week while visiting the ""more prestigious"" UCs back in Fall Quarter.

I ask that you **please upvote and share** this post in discords, fb chats, etc. for **transparency of this useless tuition increase**. I am a part of ASUCI but no one in that organization has attempted to reach out to students about this tuition increase all year and I have realized that the organization is complacent and I have had to resort to a reddit post. There will also be a lot of ASUCI people downvoting this with their sock accounts. They see direct benefit from staying in UCSA with the clout they get by shaking hands and taking photos with higher political figures instead of putting time and effort into bettering the lives of the students.

Again, please attend the Senate meeting **this Thursday, April 28th, at 5 pm** with this zoom link[ https://uci.zoom.us/j/97062458514](https://uci.zoom.us/j/97062458514) and urge the senators during public comment to vote to leave UCSA. Also, I know this post is all over the place. Im not the best at writing long-winded paragraphs but I hope I was able to get the message across. Thank you."

I am in crossroads, I am not sure where my career is going but definetively I am not enjoying this.  


I've gratuated from computer engenieering 3 years ago, first I had my dev internship and after that got an offer on a infraestructure/devops position which I liked but it wasn't much development but a LOT of support, after 2 years there I quitted and went for another support position (10 months now) that promised me it would be more technical or script/code involved but it ended up to be just a L2 analysis role, which at this day I am starting to hate since a lot of the ""work"" there doesnt depend on me but on a lot of people replying to emails, no documentation at all, I have to be behind someone to teach me a lot of details since I cannot go on my own. I am being very unproductive (Yes, I know this is not right), there will be not much time before this starts to affect me since i dont really like what I'm currently doing.  
I want to get into a dev role, I really enjoy to code (backend mostly) and actually it was my first intention, to get a dev job and also I have colleages that tell me about their jobs and seems to be really good since they actually make things and use tech as I wanted on high school. Currently I feel that I'm a little out since I dont practice currently, I'm start to think to definetively quit, start studying a LOT and get another job but I don't know if that would affect me on my history or that stuff that HR looks on you when you are on a hiring process.  


 Any opinion is very well recieve, and thanks for reading!"

udenk9,16,2022-04-27,Characteristic impedance in a funnel-shaped waveguide,LioTang,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/udenk9/characteristic_impedance_in_a_funnelshaped/,"Okay so I'll try to keep this concise.

I'm working as an intern. My mission is to design a funnel shaped waveguide. Basically, there is a WR430 that gets fed a 2.45GHz wave, the wave then passes through a funnel shaped waveguide which leads to a third waveguide, which is rectangular filled with FR4 Epoxy. This third waveguide's dimensions is 10x2.5cm and 40cm long. 

I have to determine the length of the funnel shaped waveguide to match the impedances of the line, then simulate the whole thing on Ansys HFSS and test with different powers to heat the epoxy homogenously at a certain temperature. On paper this seems awfully simple, however the problem is that I have no idea how to get the characteristic impedance of the funnel shaped waveguide. I barely found anything on funnel shaped waveguides on the internet, except horn antennas and one paper about optical transmission I don't even have access to, and that doesn't help me in the slightest towards determining that characteristic impedance.

I have done some calculations, which gives me a funnel shaped waveguide of about 0.089 lambda g, which is about 8.8 cm or so. For these calculations, I've made the model of the entire thing and HFSS with a semi-random length for the funnel and looked at the wave ports impedance in the solution data. In my calculations it gives me a reflection coeff of -0.23 at the input and 0.05 at the load, not too bad, but there are two problems : HFSS says it's -0.23 and 0.2 instead, and more importantly, my internship supersivor said that the length of the funnel shaped waveguide should be around lambda/4. I did try to make it that length, but it made the line completely mismatched.

I'm pretty sure the problem comes from the characteristic impedance I chose for the funnel, which leads back to my question : is there any way to calculate it?

Anyways, thanks if you've read the entire thing, especially if you have any idea on how to make this work. If anything seems unclear or you got any question feel free to ask."

I’m almost 26 years old and completely burnt out. I had a pretty promising career from ages ~20-24, but things have gone south since then. 

For the last few years I have tried several different jobs, none of which has been particularly difficult, but I have failed every single time and had to quit within the first few months. I’m tired, my mental health is completely shot, and I have zero energy to work anymore.

I’ve been in therapy for a long time now, seeing a psychiatrist, taking meds, doing all the stuff I’m supposed to do, and it’s just not working. I’m no less exhausted than I was 2 years ago. No matter how much rest I get, I just want to sleep and never lift a finger. Pushing myself and being hard on myself just makes things worse.

At this point, I just don’t know what to do. I have bills and debt piling up and I’m just about out of money. I’m trying to apply for disability but the process is like pulling teeth and idk if I’m going to get anything. I have a small support network, but no one I know has enough money to support me. I feel like I am out of options; all I want to do is rest but every day seems to bring up new shit that I have to deal with. 

This is a serious question: what are people supposed to do in these kinds of situations? In all the years I spent in school, doing internships and crappy entry-level office jobs, no one ever told me this could happen. But I’m sure I’m far from the first person to experience this. What do I do?"

I managed to get pass initial interviews and into finals for many of the position that I applied for. Risk Analyst, Development Management, and Information Analyst roles. I noticed that final interviews are usually older men, 90% of the time. They are either the director or high up in the position of the company.

Recently I got put into the final interview with UPS as a Information Security Analyst and I'm literally clueless as to how to pass the final interview. I was told before that I am a little too unnatural when answering questions but I feel as if there has to be more to it to fail 4 interviews. I pass most initial interviews so I think Im doing something correct.

I am being contacted next week to go over a job offer and to discuss salary. With the big increase in inflation and IT wages, and the sheer variation in what different companies offer, I'm feeling uncertain as to what I should negotiate for and what's a decent wage these days.

Some background:

1 year Linux Engineer internship - 32k total comp.

2 years Software Engineer - started at 38k with 10% bonus and 3k stocks, now on 41k with 10% bonus and 5k stocks, for a total comp of around 49k.

The position I'm getting the offer for is also Software Engineer, for a multinational FinTech company with offices in Dublin (work is primarily remote). Earlier in the year when I first started planning to move I was thinking of 55k for slightly over a 10% jump on what I'm currently getting, but now I'm thinking that that's on the low side.

Sorry for the salary question; I know everyone is tired of them. I just don't want to end up getting shafted, as I'm generally a bit dire when it comes to negotiating these things.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice!"

My life in general I would say is quite good. I am an army reservist, in college about to graduate (Computer Science major). I have 2 classes in the summer, 2 classes next fall, 4 right now. I've been working out 6 days a week for years. I meditate so I'd say my mind is quite stable and for the most part I feel at peace.

Now my problem is that I feel that I can't seem to do as much as I want. When I do my school work for some reason it takes all day long. I live with my parents; I would rather work and move out. I always hear stories about people managing to move out, work, and do school. My little brother is doing this exact thing. I'm not sure if I'm looking for jobs thoroughly enough or there exists no jobs in my desired field that I am able to work around these awkward school hours. I just got an internship but my summer classes go from (1-3pm mon-wed). It's going to interfere with my internship but I want to make it work somehow? Looking at all I have wrote, I wonder if these are excuses I tell myself. They have to be I mean, in my mind I'm not afraid to take risks, go for it, you know?

I get that it's wrong to compare myself with other people. I do it anyway, I know I'm capable of more and I wonder how other people manage this. The girl I'm talking to is like the captain of every club, tutors a bunch of subjects, works, does college and I'm sitting at Starbucks taking all day to complete an assignment. I lie and say I have a job working with my friend (the only thing I lie about). Even on weekends I always go in the morning, and come home when they close at 9. I'm not one to consume entertainment in long bouts of time wasting. I used to though.

I always had life in me until I dated this girl in high school. She sort of changed my thinking to more nihilistic and for years I really just survived, never really wanting to thrive. I'd say up until 1-2 years ago I really set out to improve my life in every aspect. I have, I am fired up for life and I feel driven. However, I cannot help but feel there are still self imposed limitations I put on myself I am not conscious of? Thought patterns I use which cause me to come up short and disappoint myself?

Now if I was trying to rationalize it, I'd say MAYBE I'm not as slow as I think? Maybe since I have all day I take my time? So if I did work, I would spend the time I do have left over with a higher sense of urgency?

It helps enough now that I fully was able to express this and thought it out. I appreciate any help or encouragement, a new perspective would be nice."

udjiom,3,2022-04-27,Accepting counteroffer,Bubbly_Temperature_2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/udjiom/accepting_counteroffer/,"Hi, I’m currently an intern and I graduate soon so I wanted to get a full time position at the company. I really like the company (a good sized &amp; reputable company) and the team and expressed to my manager that I would want to stay. 

However, they told me they couldn’t get anything in writing and I already had another offer so I told them I would unfortunately have to resign if I couldn’t secure a full time position. 

Long story short, I resigned. And then a short while after, they came back with an offer to start full time after I use up my intern budget paying 60% more than my existing offer. 

Has anyone experienced accepting a counter offer? I read about horror stories where people get fired soon after. I worry that I will somehow get fired before I even get to start my new position. Am I right for being wary?"

udlktc,1,2022-04-27,Help with College Decision,remusjblack,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/udlktc/help_with_college_decision/,"College A:
• large city college
• close to home, ~3 hr drive. parents have mentioned they would be more than happy to pick me up for the weekend whenever I want
• fairly cheap tuition/fees as colleges though, affordable (in terms of college)
• have a few friends going there
• a degree program I think I'll really like
• I would have to take a lot of basic classes before I got to actual interesting classes
• terrible surrounding neighborhood (the city isn't bad, but you have to drive for a little to get into it)
• decent dorms
• honors college (first pick at classes)
• campus is ehh looking
• extremely diverse


College B:
• smaller than college A but still large city school (im honestly fine with either size)
• gorgeous campus 
• great surrounding area (cute little town)
• also a like 20 min drive from a large city
• a TON of opportunities within the area (lot of businesses and internships)
• 3 hour flight :(
• a lot more expensive than college A. my parents have said they're willing to make it work but I know it would be hard on them
•  colder (not used to the cold lol)
• the tiniest dorms I have ever seen
• honors college (first pick at classes)
• all the pathways I've expressed interest in before are available at this university, but not at college A.
However based on my interests at the moment, college A has a degree program that encompasses a ton of what I want to do as one whereas college B doesn't really have it all together; I'd have to pick one.
• fairly diverse
• honors college (first pick at classes)
• wouldn't know anyone else there but I would have someone to contact in an emergency (my mom went to college in the same area so she still has a lot of friends there)

I'd love to hear anyone's take on which one I should go to and why, just trying to decide rn
also yes my parents are awesome I love them sm"

udnjeo,5,2022-04-28,Not sure where to commit and I need thoughts about UCSD CS from current students.,NorthMacNCheese,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/udnjeo/not_sure_where_to_commit_and_i_need_thoughts/,"I need to decide where to commit for undergrad very soon and I've narrowed it down to two choices. One of them is UCSD where I'd be studying CS in CSE. My other choice is Carnegie Mellon. I won't say which major at CMU I'm in but it's **not** any type of engineering or computer science.

I'm currently interested in software engineering but I also like business (so computer science comes first)

With that being said how is computer science at UCSD? Is getting into classes hard? How big are CS classes typically? Is there active recruitment on campus for internships? Are there active CS-related orgs on campus with cool projects to work on? How good is the professor teaching and is it easy to interact directly with them? Is it easy to get help from TAs and such? Do most people end up going into industry after graduating or grad school? Are CS students generally collaborative? Is it easy to pursue minors in other areas (ex. econ) as a CS major? 

I have a lot of questions and I get that some of these might be hard to answer but I would appreciate any type of input. Ultimately, I'm choosing the school based on the academic experience and career opportunities. I do care about other aspects such as weather and school spirit and social aspects but not nearly as much. I will say that cost isn't a factor, since the price difference between attending CMU and UCSD is negligible for me. Thanks everyone :)"

I am returning to school for a degree in SWE or computer science. All the acceptances are in and I am weighing-in on the options. So, I have plenty of questions and I am reaching out to a wider audience of communities for help in addition to private messaging students on reddit, and friends working in the field. 

Please feel free to message me to discuss your experiences and thoughts!

**Some questions that have arisen:**

* Any advice, preference, or tips in selecting the three programs below? What would you pick and why? 
* Is there a preference for CS over SWE degrees in the first couple jobs? \[there is a lot of *Computer Science or a related field*"" in requirements for jobs and internships such as Google STEP and Google Research Internships\]
* Is finding my own summer 4-month internship ridiculously competitive after first year? \[Carleton\] or Second year? \[Western\]
   * What about finding my own internships after having 1 internship already?
* Will BASc SWE degree prevent me from taking a masters in CS? Do you know anyone that did BASc SWE and MSc CS?

**My School Options:**

* **UOttawa: BASc Software Engineering (Mandatory CO-OP)** 
* **Carleton: Bachelor of Computer Science Honours, Software Engineering Stream** 
* **Western: Bachelor of Science, Computer Science**"

I really like building electronics projects, and have done some work with PICs/FPGAs/ARM stuff, but it's all been very introductory and within the confines of individual projects and lessons.

I'm very fortunate to get this opportunity working with embedded design engineers on electronics projects, but I don't want to let them down and make them feel like they picked the wrong candidate. I want to be able to learn what they have to teach me right out of the gate.

Are there any online courses/study materials that could help prep me on the makeup and design of embedded electronics?

I know it's an internship and I'm expected to not know much, but I'm definitely a very weak coder in the context of embedded systems and I want to change that.

All advice is much appreciated, can't wait to learn more!"

The number one online retailer in the world now.

I started great working with the early shift. Supervisors are amazing, and add my motivation to it. We were having a blast at work. I got good compliments about my work and my boss wants me to work foe them permanently. Whicv means I take over a manager position and have to do late shifts instead.
Late shifts are a different thing. The supervisors who are under me are not great to be honest and we don't get along. One of them is egoistic and the other is completely unacceptable. She would backstab multiple times a day and write in internal group xhat how shitty i am so the other managers could see it.

Since the late shift my motivation is non existent and I'm leaving the company at the end of my internship. I have decided that and I do not want to change the decision.

I expressed this to my boss yesterday and he is coming to our warehouse location next week and wants to talj to me more about it. I guess he wants me to stay.

Ihave given him the reason as I want  to finish my studies. I didn't want to state that I don't want to work with a team like what I have in the late shift.

Funnily enough two other managers have left the organisation who handled late shifts within one year.

When my boss comes next week, what should I do? 1. Should I give him the real reason for leaving or 2. should I maintain my story about studies?"

I just did an internship as an Android developer for 6 months at a startup, but I have no CS degree (did a software development course). Startup didn't have budget to hire me, so therefore I couldn't stay there.

I just got a job offer as a full stack developer, even though I have not much experience with it. The company really wants to invest in me. I haven't worked with databases yet, and I also haven't done a lot of web, so I would have to learn a lot. I think I could really learn a lot this position and the company seems really nice. The company is also supportive of me getting a CS degree, so I can work 4 days per week at the company. 

On the other side: I like Android and Kotlin a lot, the technology is very interesting and new. But I believe Android is a much smaller market. So far, most companies require more experience than a 6 months internship for a junior, but I think I can get a job after I finish some personal projects. So then I would have to work full time, and I don't think I can manage to get a degree while working full time. I am already familiar with Android, so it kind of feels like the 'easy choice'.

I feel like I am kind of at a crossroad right now. It's either: full stack web part time + getting a CS degree part time, or full time Android. Any insights or advice would be highly appreciated!"

udtlgg,2,2022-04-28,I'm fucking tired of learning art.,DooM_SpooN,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/udtlgg/im_fucking_tired_of_learning_art/,"A bit of ranting about my life first.

Ever since I was little, comics had been a huge part of my life. Be it European, American or Japanese, I've always enjoyed reading them. Along with that love came, obviously, video games and I decided that I wanted to work in one of those industries no matter how stressful it is. 

My parents being pretty conservative would only accept me learning something in the field of medicine, engineering or law, me drawing was always terrible and ""I had to be born with it"". Years later after failing to learn how to code in college I decided that maybe I could be a director or producer so I got a bachelor in company relations as it was the closest thing to that. 

My country had maybe one school of contemporary arts on the other side of the country and I was already struggling to pay rent. Moving out was out of the question. I finally land a job...as a translator for a private transportation company, where I did everything but translate for 50% of the two months I worked there. After two months the boss came in and said, ""as part of our contract, we are required to employ you after this unpaid internship. Thing is, we don't need a translator since you translated everything already. So you can go on another internship as a call center/salesman"". Summer vacations were about to hit, I'd spent 2 month already without pay. Another 2 months in a high stress job with no pay, as someone that had to work and study his whole life up until then, this was unacceptable. I'd bear with being swindled up until then because I was a student looking for scraps and my country is known for its under-the-table job market. With a bachelor in my pocket, this was the last straw. I gave up on my ever more costly apartment (seriously fuck you AirBnB, I hope you all collectively break your pelvises), sold everything stashed what I wanted to keep at my grandma's and went back to my parent's. I told them that my life up until now had been nothing but disappointment after following the family's advice and I was tired of waiting for things to get better and bearing stupid ass decisions. My parents were oddly understanding.

Learnt German in a year so I could look for a job here aaaaaand I'm about to get one when COVID hits. Panic and lockdown and I get a call telling me people were gonna get laid off so they wouldn't bother interviewing me. Fine, I'll experiment with stuff. Streaming is a no go. Stressful and I wasn't having much fun talking to myself on the cam. Ok what about a video game course? 4k bucks later, I feel like I've learnt very little and most of what I did was from an 20 bucks unreal game dev course. Blueprints is the most I could learn and even then I failed to get two actors to teleport from one prop to another (the teleport tutorial is 3 mins long, I combed through it at least 5 times).

So, finally, I decide to learn art. I was done thinking these concept or illustrations were ""so cool"" and decided to act upon it. Spent a year kinda getting to know the field, decided I had spent enough time on paper to buy drawing tablet with screen. And from July 2021 to today, I've been doing my stuff digitally.
Learning art is really hard especially since I don't have any background or knowledge. Tutorials on the net all assume you have a certain level even though they are for ""beginners"" and this is where I'll start seriously ranting. Content creators, STOP saying shit like ""as a beginner artist"" 90% of the time you refer yourselves to ""beginner artists"" you're thinking about those guys who are entering college and already have a pretty good level. You're thinking about those guys that can do their own illustrations with a fairly good construction but are still missing a certain spark or make small mistakes. I am tired of hearing ""when I was a beginner artist"" and then the dude shows an incredibly detailed oc that is kinda out of perspective or one that has absolutely no flaw but the fact that the lines are thick. Yeah man good job humble bragging.

And speaking about bragging man, I'm sorry Marc Brunet, I've recently bought your art school program and I'm currently on the first term. It's definitely a very solid course and worth the money. You seem like a great guy and you're pretty funny but buddy, seriously, your youtube videos? making a video where you say that you don't need to study much when you're an industry veteran of 20+ years? yeah no shit man. Sleep is important for artists? yeah I know it's important for anything. Been watching his content since I started 2 years ago and I feel like I've heard him say the same 4-5 points over and over.

Oh but wait it gets better. I enrolled on a few courses from my local art school. Life drawing, illustration and digital painting. I introduce myself as a complete beginner that has used the digital medium and wants to draw characters.

- Life drawing teacher goes ballistic. Starts a rant saying shit like ""how are you going to draw when there's no power?!?"", ""You just need a pencil, paper and a model, not all that expensive equipment"" yeah ma'am, I don't live in the mountains or on some half dead village in the middle of nowhere and paying for a model would quickly turn more expensive than my Intuos. Teaches very little beyond encouraging me to try and draw the models using graphite or chalk (which I happily do). I'm here to better my technique and I want to really learn but just doing models for 2h a week with a commentary of ""you made x too long"" isn't quite helping much.

- Digital painting: ""Oh we can do, a character on the last two lessons that we'll have"", ""You can learn anything from the internet"", ""I don't know of any ateliers you can join to further your studies"". Let's see how those last lessons are gonna look like.

- Illustration teacher: proudly shows us what his students are doing, some of them have some great portraits and characters exactly, what I wanna do. I bug him further after class and he tells me to come to a consultation at his atelier. ""yeah characters is what everyone wants to do these days. I make most of my money doing illustrations for companies and supermarkets. Objects and landscapes is where the money's at, let's do a landscape"" Proceeds to have me draw a landscape, it's terrible, I'm not used to the tools, the method and the subject. ""Keep doing landscapes, you know humans is hard for people like us and it's not that profitable"" No man, I'm not in this for the money. I'd love to become good enough that people would pay money for my stuff, but I'm in this for myself. I want to learn how to draw people so I can draw characters. Fuck backgrounds and landscapes, I can bother with that shit once I reach a point where I'm happy with my work and want to complete my illustrations. I was fairly clear on my objective. He also went on a rant because a young girl in class was making questions on digital and animation, she wanted to become an animator and while her attitude towards the class was ""why would I want to learn this? how do I use these methods in digital? is it useful for animation?"", which I understand is annoying, she left that class after he went on a rant that animation ""is a pain in the ass and she shouldn't pursue it"".

What's with these egos? If you don't know how to do it just point me to someone who does, what's with the hate towards digital?  is it because it's more popular than the thing you've spent your life learning and now stubbornly refuse to adapt or acknowledge? Fucking musicians are also artists and they love their digital/electric/modern stuff. I keep seeing pupils with electric keyboards, electric guitars, bases and electric violins. Why does it have to be drawing that generates this hate towards the modern?

And discord advices: ""Just keep on drawing"", ""just trace until you get the forms down"", ""I just copy stuff every day lol"".

I'm super harsh on myself with this, I know I'm progressing but not at the pace that I want. I would love to be able to make a simple illustration, even if it's bad, by July for my birthday. Drawing is something I really want to learn well and I don't want to just be the guy that can draw a few comic caricatures in the office. It's something I should've started 10 years ago, but I'm here now and I'm giving it a lot of time. I'm 30 and all these ""it takes 6 years to get good"" comments scares the shit out of me, especially when learning this is being an absolutely tangled mess of people telling me to focus on things I don't want to focus on and my opinions and wishes are absolutely null in their eyes. It's like I'm a 18 year old kid to them ""You don't need to do more than 2 hours a day"" yes I do, my 3-4 hours a day aren't nearly enough, I'd love to learn landscapes under you but my objective is elsewhere and I don't want to take a 2 year detour on a subject that doesn't interest me currently. A former art student friend that is helping me: ""You want to do people then you need to do objects."" ""You're doing objects, is it for clothing? no? go back to people."" ""You don't know how to do people? Learn basic shapes."" ""You're doing basic 3d shapes? that's boring, do something more engaging"" ""you want to do people? FORCE is good check their channel"" ""your FORCE is weird and you need more practice. Go do basic shapes"" like make up your fucking mind. I can't be jumping subject around every day.

I'm gonna keep drawing, I'm not giving up, ever. It's so very hard to keep motivated under these circumstances, wish I'd do more than 3-4 hours a day and I can't thank my parents enough for letting me crash rent free and pursue this. I hope I'll get good enough one day, doesn't have to be anything absolutely crazy, as long as it looks like the thing that I want it to look, but it would be cool if it did. If I ever get there I'm likely to make a series on youtube for actual beginners, without the bragging, with actual exercises and homework. Feels like this is all made to make you throw cash and give up. It's so frustrating, wanting to get better and people not actually helping you with it. I know this isn't easy but it's such a jumbled mess. Drawing is so fun. I'm genuinely happy that I found this.

And since you're the only person I named here. Marc, if you read this (yeah right), you're an amazing artist and teacher but man, I had to get that out of my chest. Sorry, if not, you got 300 bucks off me which is always a win.

Lately I learned that my company lost the contract to all the posts in my downtown area. I have until summer to find a new job. I asked my supervisor about this and he tells me they sometimes say they lose the contract but get it back. So I'm not taking any chances and looking for a new job.

I'm currently hunting for a work from home job as that seems to be more of my thing. I've been applying and I would typically send 30 resumes a day. But I get hundreds of rejection letters by the next week. I am not so sure if it is my resume or if none really wants to hire anyone at this point. But I keep on applying on Indeed and LinkedIn and so far I get a lot of rejection letters.

My background: aside from working security, before this I worked at a computer repair shop as a intern for 1 year. I did various computer repair, cleaning computers, wiping hard drives, adding anti virus software, general tech fixes, answering phone calls. Before that I would occasionally help my dad at his store here and there. I did go to community college for 3 to 5 years but I was not sucessful with some of my classes so I dropped out. I am mostly interested in WFH type jobs but I was wondering what else can I do?"

udy7wi,3,2022-04-28,"""The only thing worse than being exploited by a capitalist is not being exploited by a capitalist.""",Ooshlu,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/udy7wi/the_only_thing_worse_than_being_exploited_by_a/,"tl;dr: I apply for a position with a former mentor; their consultant hiring manager jerks me around for over two weeks breadcrumbing an interview, says the salary isn't negotiable even though the public job posting says it is negotiable, asks for two cover letters, and writes horribly worded/redundant non-profit-speak emails only to reject me after moving the goal posts for experience level.

So I've been working in the finance and operations dept of a large law firm for over a year now. I have been casually looking for other jobs as I am somewhat bored. Recently, I saw a former mentor posting a position for their non-profit on LinkedIn that is within my major field of study. I was super excited because the entry level research opportunity had a better salary than most research positions (i.e. around 50k with benefits instead of like 35k). I applied right away--highlighting that I previously interned with the job poster in college.

I didn't hear anything for over a week. Finally, I followed up with the hiring manager (who is a consultant) about my application to make sure they even received it since it was just by email and not an application portal. The consultant replied almost immediately, told me the job poster remembered me well, and that I would be contacted about an interview that week as I was in the queue. I was ecstatic to be remembered and considered for the role. I thought finally I can work in a field that makes somewhat of a difference instead of just making money for big corporations.

A couple days later I received an email from the consultant asking if I *had even read the job description* based on my cover letter. I was a little confused, but I clarified that yes I had read the job description and understood what the firm was working on. I told them my questions about the firm in my cover letter were about why the firm was hiring new talent and what would that talent be working on. They had interpreted my questions as not having read all of their website regarding current projects instead of being about the position they were hiring for. 

They also told me they had received applications for the entry level research role from candidates with masters degrees and whether I still wanted to apply to it. They recommended I apply for another position they were hiring for that was a support role that included some management work. I didn't really understand how my experience better aligned with this position, but I told them if they thought I would be a better fit then to submit my resume for the role. 

I also submitted some questions about the role as the job description was vague. The compensation for this support role was also much lower, but in the description it said it was negotiable. I told them if they wanted me for this role we would have to negotiate otherwise I would be taking a significant pay cut from my current salary.

I got an email back from the consultant wherein she failed to answer any of my questions, said the salary wasn't actually negotiable, and asked me to submit **another** cover letter for that second support position as soon as possible since the application was due a week ago and they're in the interviewing phase. I was dumbfounded. Were they trying to talk me out of both roles and to just not apply? 

Also can I just say-- you would think non-profit employees/consultants were paid *by the word.* These were some of the most jargon-y, redundant and longwinded emails I had ever received. I work for attorneys so I'm used to like one sentence emails if they even bother to construct a sentence. 

Anyway, my experience matched with everything about both roles, but I just didn't have a masters degree which was marked as 'preferred' but not required. Moreover, I know the job poster-my mentor-knew I could work really hard and learn things on the job. I was like... 'okay, fine I can write something quick about how I fit this role for my mentor.' Re the negotiable non-negotiable salary, I figured if they wanted me enough they would find the money for the role. I sent them another cover letter.

Two more days pass and I receive the following response: ""After further review we have decided that this role requires a professional background that includes 2+years experience with designing research projects. Therefore we will not be moving you forward to interview for the position."" I screamed after reading that email. Not only did they move the goal posts on the required experience, they wasted so much of my time.

I nearly threw my computer across the room for all the wasted time, bread-crumbing an interview, and how unprofessional this hiring manger treated me. I have been treated better by cold-call LinkedIn recruiters. Moreover, I was shocked that my mentor was essentially cosigning this unprofessional behavior. All the emails from the consultant made it seem like my mentor was aware of how the consultant was conducting this search.

Honestly, I feel like I dodged a bullet due to all those red flags, but I'm just super disappointed to be treated this way by a mentor and for all my wasted time (3-4 hours which I know is small compared to some searches on this sub). It made me think of  how my college advisor would always tell us when applying for internships with non-profits that ""The only thing worse than being exploited by a capitalist is not being exploited by a capitalist."" And that quote feels true. At least I know I'm being exploited when I work for a corporation instead of this guilting/shaming feeling that non-profits use to extract more labor from their employees.. and, I guess, prospective employees. Anyway, I don't think I'll ever work for a non-profit because I'm just not willing to deal with this bullshit."
udylha,3,2022-04-28,Computer Science Grad School VS Industry: Feeling Lost After Undergrad,e_n_v,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/udylha/computer_science_grad_school_vs_industry_feeling/,"I would like some career advice relating to if I should pursue a masters or go into industry for a while before potentially doing a masters later on.

I'm graduating with an undergraduate bachelor's double major in Computer Science and Math from the University of Toronto this spring. As part of my program, I worked as a backend software developer intern at a company where I worked very hard and made some good connections. Not only was I working hard, but in some ways, I was completing the same tasks as a senior developer at my time at the company and was the most knowledgable on our team with respect to 4 projects our team was working on. The team worked on about 25 projects that had to do with a data processing pipeline and other IoT projects.

My parents have always been outspoken in their views that just an undergraduate degree is not enough for an individual to excel in any field. While I partly believe that because of how I've been raised (my parents both have additional degrees in their education), I also have seen senior developers do very well with just an undergraduate bachelor's degree.

In the winter I got accepted into a Masters of Management in AI (MMAI). When I applied for it, I was really excited about it. What got me most excited about the masters was being in a leadership position. Maybe one day I could be a manager or a team lead. I really loved planning and architecting solutions over the course of my internship but also being in meetings with clients, salespeople, sr developers to discuss new ideas and solutions we were working on. So to help with that, the MMAI would provide me with management skills plus also do some AI which I think is important knowledge in any techical field moving forward (although I'm not sure I totally agree with this anymore).

The program is a 12-month intensive program that does mostly AI/ML work and some management as well as part of the degree. It also has a consulting project as part of the degree which I thought was exciting. Now I'm not nearly as excited by it. I just finished a very long and difficult term, where I felt almost disinterested in the topics taught in my lectures. It was weird, I was having this constant inner conflict that I learned so so much in my internship and I felt like I didn't learn much at all in my final year. That also maybe because of my own lack of motivation. I've ended this term and actually this degree feeling like what was the point in the last year. There were some cool things here and there but I didn't really make any new friends, courses were just ok and the courses that I enjoyed most weren't CS-related.

Last week the Software Director at the company I interned at asked if I would like a full-time job. No specifics with respect to salary or anything like that. But he said we could set up a meeting to discuss all of that in detail. That was exciting to me, but mostly because someone had validated my hard work after having gone through a year where my hard work didn't seem validated whatsoever and quite honestly sometimes felt pointless.

Now, that I'm done with undergrad, I've been reconciling with the 2 directions. Either go into the program as I initially planned. It's short so I'd be back in industry within a year, or go back to work and if I do a masters degree later on then that's what I'll do! I think I don't have a clear objective on what I really want to do career-wise and was really hoping that over the course of my undergrad I'd get that clarity. Now I'm not sure and people keep asking me what excites me but I'm not sure what does. I think going back to industry excites me slightly more but after working for 1yr will I have the same realization? I need to go back to school, I need to do a master's, why didn't I do it sooner?

Have others been in this sort of situation? Do others have advice on how to move forward?"

However, recently I learnt digital marketing on a self-taught basis. Basic trainings of various platforms such as Hootsuite, Hubspot, Wordpress, FB, Google, Bing and Pinterest Ads ,MailChimp and Aweber campaigns. Manychat chatbot integration and so on. I have learnt all this in my spare time. Apart from implementing /experimenting these in a few personal projects, I never really got hands on experience in these tools. I want to change careers now as have been working in customer services and just sick of listening to complaints of the people now. 

I have applied at heaps of places in Melbourne in digital marketing , but I believe due to lack of experience no one takes me seriously.  A recruiter is offering me an unpaid internship , 3 days/ week , in a mid size organisation for a fee. He says the industry is hot and after gaining experience, you will definitely be hired by someone for sure. He doesn’t guarantees full time job though but stressed that things will definitely open up for me. 
He is charging an amount of around 2000 AUD. 

I am a tempted to pay him the instalment and go ahead with that. 

However this question kinda lingers on, 2000 is a big amount for me , and what if even after the internship,I still won’t get a job in digital marketing space?"

I have decided to go to George Mason University for a master's in computer science in Fall and I will have about 5 months of time from June to prepare for internship interviews. 

I wasted a lot of time reading and learning about each and every data structure and algorithm. I am tired and exhausted. So, I am taking a break for 1 month (I have my final exams next month).

I will now solely focus on patterns. I will follow only Blind 75, Grind 75 and Sean Prashad's list. 

But, I have a question. How can I effectively follow and solve problems using these lists? How should I go about each and every problem? How many questions should I do each day? What are my chances of getting into a good company (FAANG or not) after properly following these lists? 

I want to start with Blind 75 and progress to other lists only after finishing it.

Thanks in advance!"

And I recently stumbled upon a job offer for a company that is in the same field as my current one but had junior/part time intern positions for a different role in this field. However this company is based in a different town, but they seemed to offer work from home so I decided to apply anyway an hear more detail from them. 

They called me recently and told me they were quite interested in my application (its hard to find people in this field with experience in my country even if it is for a different role). But they said that I will have to be on site at least for the training period. So I said I am not interested since I do not plan to relocate currently and was interested in fully remote only. The HR manager offered to ask for the possibility of fully remote work. He got back to me but just said I will be able to discuss fully remote work with the management if travel for the interview. 

So now I am not sure if they will be willing to actually agree for me to be fully remote and what exactly will take for them to agree to that. So to know exactly what they can offer I need to travel over there which means taking at least one day off at my current job, traveling by bus as I do not have a car. 

Is it me or is it weird that they are not willing to just have a short online interview to talk about what they can offer to see if I am even interested in the job as I stressed I am not willing to relocate or travel regularly? I am kind of interested in the position but I am also worried that I will travel over there for the interview and they will just tell me I need to travel regularly, or need to be at the office for the training or something like that, which will make the whole interview pointless for everyone involved, and be a huge time waste/vacation waste for me, so I am not sure what to do to go and check or just turn down the interview option or try to get an online interview."

1.  I am finishing an online computer science degree and was before this a registered nurse.  I no lomger want to remain in that field.
2.  I have family in a small town in northern canada.  There is not much for tech near me.  I also have affordable rent and would probably pay 1.5x more if i leave.
3.  I have a partner and a 1 year old daughter.  If we move, i would need a larger living space than a single, so high cost areas will be really hard on our budget.

Questions:  

1.  Without an internship, how challenging will it be to  find remote work?  I am a good interviewer and have a 3.8 gpa in my comp degree.  I am willing to do projects, take a lower salary etc for first job given my situation.  

2.   How badly do i need to move to start my career?"

I am currently doing my Masters and got this internship in my last semester (i.e. in my last semester of masters as well as doing this internship). The work culture is horrible in my team (8 am to 8 pm). If I continue here, chances are that I will be given a full time offer here. I have another offer that starts from July, but if I take that up, the pay will be slightly lower (2 lpa lower). Also, it doesn't help that the manager I am working under is from a different field and thus has unrealistic expectations while also simultaneously belittling my work.
The reason I am wondering whether I should leave or not is because have a gap of around 1 year on my resume, which I took to get into Masters (could not afford to leave the country so had to look for the best here) and also to help the family business as we were suffering from a difficult time. I have worked at another place as an intern before Masters for around 8 months (had to leave it because of family issues, which is also when I started preparing for entrance exams for Masters). Will this look bad on my resume and can it affect my job prospects in the future? (I.e. gap of a year before and then leaving two internships)"
uealp5,2,2022-04-28,"Should I drop out of mechanical engineering and pursue long term investments like video editing, graphic design, becoming a manga/comic author, bodybuilder, stocks (from my part-time job), content on social media platforms using affiliate marketing, freelancing, and selling courses",Skirt_Short,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/uealp5/should_i_drop_out_of_mechanical_engineering_and/,"Hello,

I am a current 2nd-year 19 year old engineering student at CSUN Mechanical Engineering School and am seriously considering dropping out. I have so many credits remaining but have a few reasons to consider dropping.

 

1. I am not good at my major- My GPA is currently really, really bad right now, like all my classes right now are like %50 grade, and on my last 2nd semester of the month, and the chances of me getting a job after graduation in the field are quite  high (cuz my dad company knows me and quickly will hire me) but any other jobs needs at least time and effort on internships that also need experience, and a lot of evidence that I'm very good at my job. Math was always my weakest subject in high school, and I simply chased the degree for the money and for my parents' being proud of me, not for the passionate drive many of my classmates seem to have.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I do not enjoy my major- I have no intention of utilizing my degree to any capacity upon completing the program. It has soured my life for 2 years, and I can't wait to move on to something else like investing in my skills and using freelancing and stuff like that. It seems like a waste of my time that I could have used to develop skills for a career I would much rather have.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I do not have the funds to continue my education- I am spending thousands of dollars in tuition a year and am already considerably in debt. I don't want to take another loan to finish my classes and fail again. I see no reason to deepen the hole by tens of thousands of dollars for something that will give me debt and not let me have the freedom and time to do whatever I want. It's good for immediately getting a high-paying job but all I wanted was to use that pay to invest in things like stocks to live wealthy and use real estate and stuff. 

4. If I drop this degree, - I would have to move back into my parents' house again, and everyone I know will be very disappointed in me and I won't have the guts to defend myself. I might have to move into an apartment or a roommate and work full-time or part-time depending on how much the work pays me and manage time to invest into myself and my work to gain money long-term. 

5. Reasons I don't think an engineering job will fully help me gain my goals- it will take all my time away, I have to really work all my sweat and tears each day, the job has a fixed salary so it won't raise up the pay only when I get a higher position (This is where my dad works at he has the same engineering major and wants me to become just like him), there will be constant big projects at random. But the pay is good. 

6. Reason why I chose to pursue engineering in the first place-  When people asked ""why are you doing enginering?"" I always responded with ""It interests me, it's versatile, job outlook and growth is great, I think I would enjoy it, its challenging"". I finally realized that's not how I feel at all. I enjoyed telling people ""I'm going to school for engineering"" . I really chose it because it was a safe bet and it was a comfortable simple life goal planned out by my dad, but during that time I really didn't know what to do with my life all I knew was engineering could garrtee a job a simple life and owning a home byemyself. It made me feel like less of a failure at 19 years old. It gave me hope for financial stability in the future. I was DOING something. But now I finally realize I can't do both engineering and my sidehustles at the same time. I need to sacrifice my time for the other. And know with current state of this world dating and having normal life and being average is no longer going to be successful in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I came to a realization. I had been lying to myself for 2 years. I do not enjoy math, and I'm pretty sure I hate physics too. The possibility of doing desk work and having limited interactions  and time with coworkers and clients depressed me to the core. I have worked in many restaurants during 3 years and all my life spend doing homework and studying every fucking day all my fucking life having too much hw to the point where I can't even enjoy my time. My day-to-day consists of meeting new people constantly, often for short periods of time. I love breaking down their defenses and making meaningful connections with people. 

So what would you recommend in this situation? It really seems like a waste of time to me at the moment, but I am open to everyone's opinion. My only main goal is to be wealthy and have the freedom to do whatever I want, but I don't think engineering will help me achieve that goal maybe for the pay but that's it.  I know I have a strong work ethic cuz I'm so used to studying and doing homework and getting high grades but this year I just stopped doing all that and just focused on what I really want to do. Like video editing, graphic design, becoming a manga/comic author, bodybuilder, stocks (from my part-time job), content on social media platforms using affiliate marketing, freelancing, and selling courses (could make a business or build off one doing one of these).  This life is short and I will follow my passion. The money will come as I follow my goals hopefully. Our existence in this world is merely a blink of the cosmic eye. Every hour, minute, and second must be spent to its absolute full potential. All of our time will come to an end one day, I hope to have very few regrets. 

or is there a way to use my engineering degree and get rich by 25 but if not will idk 

 So uh, thx for listening to my little rant and wish me luck with my parents. &gt;:')"

I recently contributed a ton of content to a project, more so than the other full-timers because they've been busy with other stuff. It was my first time contributing that type of content and it was quite intimidating, but I learned a lot.

I normally report to a FTE ""George"" who's nice and has only been mildly annoyed once. George told me that I'm doing well overall but could contribute more to brainstorming meetings.

Recently, George's boss ""Jack,"" who's high up in the organization, reviewed my contributions to the project.

Jack told me he appreciated my ideas and me adding content and wading through complicated terms as I was an intern doing this for the first time but said that I should be proactive (not even MORE proactive, just proactive) and take more initiative.

Jack said that I should try to ask him and George what I can do and try to find ways to help on my own.

I guess Jack is right. I do ask other FTE like George and this other person ""Lucy"" what I can do to help and sometimes they say there's not much I can do.

So Jack isn't necessarily a jerk, but this triggers me because I ask people for work and it's not like I sit around and wait to do stuff. I guess I could propose more ideas of my own and give people more comments and suggestions but I've been here for like not even 3 months. I know almost nothing though I'm learning.

Also, at this place, when it rains, it pours. In addition to Jack's project, I am working on another team's project and even stayed late to work on the other project, so I just felt like I didn't have time to edit and contribute more than what I already have done for Jack's stuff, or I'd contribute nothing to the other project.

To be honest, Jack and George and the rest are much nicer than other workplaces I've been at (I had another manager ""Mary"" who would say stuff like, ""If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't have to waste 5 minutes going to back to fix it"" and ""I can find the answers online to my questions, dunno how you can't).

I felt mildly triggered by that comment especially as I was working past hours on the other project that wasn't Jack's but I don't know if I am being too sensitive. I've been told I'm quiet and don't speak up enough my entire life. To be fair, when I came into this role, I told myself I had to improve on my work-related communication and detail-oriented-ness. I forgot I have a tendency to not be proactive.

Like I said, Jack and George and everyone else are much nicer than my last boss and I mostly get positive feedback from George and other FTE. I don't get much feedback from people on Jack's level.

I'm thinking like if I go to Malaysia then other half of the money could be contributed towards my little sister's education or towards my parents health if something happens to them tomorrow (healthcare is not free in my country and as they are growing older I'm worried about them too).

-&gt;UK university:-
1. Most desired course (bachelors in Biological Sciences)
2. More choices to specialise in Biology 
3. Tuition fees is $27,000 per year
4. Every year the tuition fees increases by 4%
5. Easy to find a job because of the new visa rules in the UK for foreigners. 
6. I can enter the Space Industry later there as this my ultimate goal.
7. I can get full one year of work experience

-&gt;Malaysian university:-
1. Not a desired course (bachelors in Science)
2. Very less specialization units
3. Tuition fees is $10,000 per year
4. Tuition fees barely increases every year but it can sometimes 
5. Extremely hard to find a job as a foreigner either in Malaysia or in neighbouring country like Singapore due to strict employers rules against hiring foreigners.
6. Conservative country (I already come from a conservative country so I'm not willing to move a similar country as mine)
7. Can graduate with an Australian degree for half the cost but the quality of teaching/facility is low.
8. I can only secure an internship for 2 months due to the course design.

I'm really struggling to make a decision. If I go to the UK then I think I'm being more selfish to my family but on the other hand I don't want to compromise with my dreams too. 

Thanks in advance.

So I got my first internship that’s starting up in a few weeks and I’ve been pretty anxious about what it’s going to be like. I’ve always kinda wondered what it’s like to be in the work force and I’ve always had this fear that I’d be presented with a problem I have no idea how to even start and I’ll just sit there looking clueless. So far I’ve maintained a pretty good gpa but I don’t know how well that will translate to the internship. Obviously it varies from job to job, but what is having an engineering job like? Can it be extremely impossible at times where you feel completely lost and hopeless? Or is it usually a low pressure thing where there’s lots of time to learn and figure things out? 

I know there isn’t one answer to this but I’d appreciate any advice or your own experiences. Thanks!

Also, what is usually more important and by how much, hard work and effort or pure intelligence?"

A little bit about myself, I have always been interested in development, started learning little bit of HTML and CSS when I was 13-14. I have close relatives who are in the tech industry (10+ YOE) and my brother who went from Tier3 college to a way decent job who have been my role-models . I worked hard in JEE to get a good college, but had to settle for either Tier1.5 Mechanical or Tier3 CSE, as I was confused as to what I want to become after 4 years, I took the better college for more chances of on-campus placements.   


Now, I am currently in the 2nd Semester and I still have a lot of time to decide my future but starting early would be better. Being from Mechanical, a lot of big companies which do not allow any branches except CS/IT/ECE are out of the question and I know I have to work hard on DS Algo and Leetcode to get a tech job. My questions are,   
1. I am currently still learning C++ and plan to start DSA from this sem and proceed towards Competitive coding (starting from easy and learning as I go forward), but is this the right time to start or should I focus more on learning Front-end frameworks and work on Web-Development since this can get me an internship in a startup (with high chances)?  
2. Should I focus on different fields of CS like AI and ML, AWS, DevOps, Android and Blockchain starting from 2nd year (3rd Sem) or is it okay if I explore them later on?  


Overall, I am confused as to what I should be doing to not fall out of the race (being from the wrong branch). I plan to start DSA and complete at least 1 project on web-development in 2nd sem (I know this might be unrealistic, but I am willing to put in the hours)."

Recently, I managed to get 2 offers for 2 3-month paid internships from my home country. 

Internship 1: It is called the Rookie program at company A. I will be trained intensively as a Java developer with the emphasis on technologies that a Java dev needs to master (Spring, Database, REST API, etc.) I will also have a chance to practice in real projects. My monthly allowance from A is X (an arbitrary amount).

Internship 2: It is called the Young Talent Software Engineer at company B. I will be working and involving in maintaining and building an actual running product. The technology stack that I will be using includes: NestJS/NodeJS, gRPC, Kafka, MongoDB, Elastic Search, etc. My monthly pay from B is 23X (23 times what A gives me).

Why do I have a hard time deciding? I want to gear my career towards being a Java dev. Interning at A will help me learn so much as a Java dev. However, I'm afraid that I might not have a lot of chances to work on real/latest projects. Contrarily, interning at B will give me hands-on knowledge and experience working on an actual running product. The pay is also insane. Since they are paying so much (keep in mind that what B pays me per month is slightly above the monthly salary of an actual junior dev in my country), I assume they expect me to involve heavily. I'm not fully confident in my ability to work with the actual stuffs yet. On top of that, I'm also afraid that I won't have time practice my Java skills.

Which one should I go for?"

I’m leaning towards (1), full time LC, as my LC skills still do not meet the bar for F/G.

I would like to go into energy or efficiency/sustainability with my mechanical engineering degree when I graduate. Last year I had an internship with a manufacturing company. This summer, I am deciding between two offers. Option A is with a large company that manufactures automotive products, and I will be working with a gasket and engine efficiency team. I will be able to stay at home with my family and enjoy more of my summer (it is 20mins away). Option B is with a major nuclear energy company, but it would require relocating 2 hours away for the summer. This is more down the line of clean energy, which I am excited about. Both pay the same, with B offering a housing stipend for the distance. 

My question is, how detrimental would choosing one offer over the other be to my career goals? Do internships really change your course after college? If I choose A, will it affect my ability to work with energy in the future?"

I just wanted to share my story with people cause applying to internships can be extremely stressful especially as a CS student and the only way to get through is to grind. 

I started applying in November and put in about 50 applications before giving up since I was rejected/ghosted from all of them. Didn’t apply for another 3 months cause I thought I was not good enough. Finally mustered the courage to apply after seeing that a lot of my friends got internship offers. One of my friends told me that LinkedIn Premium helped him get noticed. So signed up for that and applied like a literal madman. 300 applications in 15 days. (This is end of March btw). Got a few interviews, then ghosted for a long time. I did well in almost all the technical challenges btw. The interviewers seemed quite happy with my answers as well. Still ghosted.

Almost about to give up but got an interview call and decide that this might be my last shot for a summer internship cause it’s so late already. Finally interview with the company and I do well in the technical challenge. Interviewers seem quite impressed. Constantly email them showing my interest in the role. Like literally ask tons of questions about the company and the role. Wait for a couple of weeks before getting an offer. 

This post is just to let you all know that it’s not too late. I thought I had no chance at a summer internship but I literally got an offer Mid-April, a month before the internship starts. The only key is to grind and apply to every internship you see. Something will go through at the end."

I've kind of had enough of University with the courseworks (particularly for the course units I'm not really interested in) and exams and would much rather dive into a Meta (or other top company) SWE role which I can learn much more from whilst also earning some decent comp.

So I was wondering if this would be harmful for my career long-term and if senior SWE positions require a degree or would internships and full-time roles at top-tech companies suffice?

Also, anyone who has done this, how has it been?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!!"

Context: 

\- I recently graduated college end of last year

\-  Been working the help desk for the past couple of years

\- I have been learning many cloud tools and concepts over the past 9 months (Linux, AWS, Terraform, Docker, etc...)  


\- The problem is not getting interviews as my resume is good... the problem is getting past the final rounds of interviews  


I get mostly the same feedback, ""We like you and your attitude but you don't have the experience we are looking for"" despite me answering technical questions well and displaying my soft skills.   


So at this point, I am looking to work as an post-graduate intern (part-time or full-time) for anyone who is willing to give me some hands-on experience. Anything to get me past this experience wall..."

Employers have been treating employees like commodities for decades, and now the price of that commodity is rising. This is good for the you guys. (Inflation is going to screw over the boomer pensioners, but I've stopped caring about them. They never cared about us.)

But I'm sick of hearing Gen Z'ers complain about it, as if they are not being handed an employment economy not seen since the boomers graduated college. Young adults are walking out of school with zero experience and multiple $65000 job offers. My company just offered a young guy with his masters and no experience $70k.

It took me 10 years of work for the company to get up to $70k.

Again, I don't begrudge the guy at all. In fact I recommended his offer. But I'm sick of hearing Gen Z'ers today complain about how easy Millennials had it.

Seriously guys? I had lots of friends in college who had to live with their parents for years because literally no companies were hiring for years. I know married couples that had to move in with their parents with young babies. I had friends have to take NO PAY internships AFTER they graduated -and then not get a job offer when their internship ended.

Gen Z. You guys got it easy right now. Enjoy it. Give your elder millennials a rest.

Have a good day!"

uev12v,7,2022-04-29,My supervisor is dating my co-worker.,Tired_MFT,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/uev12v/my_supervisor_is_dating_my_coworker/,"Hey everyone. A few months ago, I had posted [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/s4qhxk/i_dont_think_i_want_to_be_a_therapist_anymore/) regarding burnout and professional betrayal on this forum. Since then, I have received an outpouring of support and advice from you wonderful people that has been tremendously helpful. While I am currently seeking my own personal therapy to continue processing my situation, there is one other major factor of my story that I purposely left out for a number of reasons: the thread title.

Years ago, I was out to the movies over the weekend with my wife and friends. While they went to grab their seats, I went to the popcorn line, and saw my (now former) on-site supervisor on the adjacent line...embracing and kissing my (also now former) fellow clinician. I was a more than a bit shell shocked, but my OSS encouraged me to say nothing.

Thankfully, since I was doing my internship with him at the time, I was able to have a supervisory meeting with him Monday morning to discuss all of this. According to my OSS, he claimed that the two had been dating two years before she began working at our site, and take great care to not interact beyond a professional level at the office. The only other clinician who knew their secret was leaving the next month. 

Because I was months away from finishing my internship for my degree, I rationalized it to myself and my OSS that I (truthfully) did not see any overt negative impact on the clients or myself, and anything else beyond that was none of my business anyway. I didn't want to rock the boat, and I respected both my OSS and my colleague very much (at the time, anyway), so I saw no need to take any action at the time.

Fast forward to March 2020, and the rest of my story occurred, including when my OSS fired me, lied about it, and ghosted me. Many in the original thread suggested I file a complaint to the board or leave a critical review on LinkedIn or Glassdoor.  Given how burned out I was at the time, not only was I just desiring to move on, I truthfully was also fearing some sort of retribution given what I now knew of my OSS's willingness to bend the rules. Furthermore, when I finally had the nerve to look up the website for my former site, not only did I discover that they had moved their site location completely, but my former colleague's sister was now working there as well. 

At this point, I was now completely baffled as to how begin processing all this. Factually, I still feel like I don't know how. Have any of you ever experienced anything like this? Are there any obvious ethical issues you see? And is there some other dimension to this situation I may have missed?

As always, thanks for reading, and being a cool community."

uew06r,3,2022-04-29,"Unexpected ""Name your price"" for FT SWE job for after graduation where I interned at for a defense contractor in N. Virginia, upcoming SWE internship at FANG in Bay area, what in the world do I do?",ImTheSloth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uew06r/unexpected_name_your_price_for_ft_swe_job_for/,"A bit of a backstory. Last year from late spring to mid-December 2021, I interned as a SWE Intern at a defense contractor in Northern Virginia, about 30 minutes outside of D.C. for $30/hr. At the end of my internship, I was offered a FT SWE 1 job for $83,000. The only thing was, was that I found that offer to be too low. Specifically because my graduation date, at the time, was December 2022. I countered that offer originally after receiving it and said I was looking for $90,000 with $5K relocation. They came back and said $5k relocation is done, but were super duper iffy on the salary (not sure why). We both agreed that Dec 2022 was too far out and to revisit at a later date, closer to my graduation. Coming back to school and now my graduation date, due to scheduling issues, is May 2023. Because of this, I was able to land an (extra, unplanned) internship this summer at FAANG in the Bay area. Obviously, it would super dope on the money side and career side to work there, at least to start. 

Anyways, a few days ago, a (new) recruiter from the company I previously interned at reached out to me to check in, saying that they would like to ""revisit"" my offer. That meaning, they are ready to re-negotiate. I updated them and told them my graduation date changed, and I was told it was totally fine that I am doing summer internship elsewhere and my grad date is further out now. I was also told basically to ""name your price"". They are expecting me to get back to them with ""a number"" for salary by Monday. I know for a fact that they will not be able to compete with FAANG salary. Like, they were balking at $90k salary for over 1 year out earlier.  I have heard from various FT SWEs there that I am in contact with that they have been giving aggressive raises and hiring crazily to keep up with the market. I am thinking that it is fair to ask for $105k with $10k signing bonus, given the situation currently. At the same time, however, I am 100% intending on succeeding at my FAANG internship and receiving a FT return offer. I would hate to burn the bridge at my previous company by accepting an offer that is over a year out (again -- that was my stipulation for not accepting the original offer). Any advice anyone could offer? What I am thinking is just being straight up with my HR contact, previous management that wants me back and saying ""I think it would be great for us both to re-assess this, again, at a date closer to my (new) grad date."" I think they would still be willing to do that.


**TL;DR**: I interned at a defense company near D.C. last year for 6 months, did really well and got a return offer for $83k, grad date at the time was 12/2022, i asked for $90k, they were weird about it. Agreed to re-visit as grad date got closer. I return home, grad date gets pushed back to 05/2023, get a FAANG internship because I have the schedule to, now they of course want to ""revisit my offer"" and asked me to throw them a number, I don't really know what to do because I don't want to burn the bridge with them by accepting (if their offer is good enough) and then possibly reneging if I get FAANG FT offer after summer."

I just Feel like I really need to share and write about what's happening to me because I still don't seem to realize how i've gotten into this position.
6 Years ago (I was 17), I got my highschool degree with a pretty good mark, I wasn't the brightest kid or the most hard working but I was Intelligent and could do very well if i decided to. I decided then, that I would pursue a Dental degree abroad, because firstly I knew that i would enjoy the scientific aspect of it and because it seemed like an engaging and exciting career.
Once there I had a very difficult time adapting myself to people that speak my langage, let alone locals ( I didn't speak the language my first year ), plus Semester after semester I started realizing how shitty the education was and how little we were actually trained. We were also basically abused by the uni (threats/Bribery/Injustice/Lies). So like the saviour I am and through lack of experience and some intertwined process of inferiority complex and anxiety (of losing 2 years of uni wich seemed like a lot); I decided to stay.
It was like a group hypnosis, everyone saw what was happening, everyone talked about and worried about it but no one actually did anything to change that (because of the injustice that reigned.
Year after year I got desensitized to all that was happening and just started feeling numb, soulless, no identity, no personality. I also didn't care at all about the Diploma since it had lost all of it's value in my eyes. I Was going to struggle to be decent and never actually Feeling like i've achieved something or became properly educated.
I learned the language through making friends and talking to locals, and studied for myself when I could and passed exams passively and numbingly just to feel like i was doing something but eventually I just felt like I was regressing in every aspect of my person.
I hung out with people that didn't share any common interests except for the shared trauma, not intellectually stimulated whatsoever.
I became more and more recluded as My insecurities grew stronger over the years. I felt like an imposter wich to some degree I was ( it's considered to be an reoccurent phenomenon in  the field). So i just kinda went with and although I was honest with my parents about what was happening I felt more and more insecure   in the presence of (successful friends (all the worthy friends i had) so i avoided everyone/ didn't revise even the most basic shit because of anxiety and inferiority ( when i tried i would just be so frustrated because of how slow i had become, i had difficulty retaining information... (All due to dissociation from the trauma according to my psychologist).
So I told my parents i would take those 2 years so i could figure out what i would do. Did many internships and felt awfully uncomfortable/ anxious/quirky but I did it anyways. I felt physically ill and couldn't function properly 
Anymore and that affected my interpersonal relationships as well, I felt out of touch with reality, Like a stranger in my country and like an observer of my mind.
6months from now the 2 years will be over, I overcame many challenges but i'm still living with my parents, depending on them financially while i still can't work and feeling inadequate and unfit for the real world. I am pouring bad energy on everyone, I have no friends, I smoke weed a lot; didn't decide yet on what to do and plainly freaking out, running out in circles powerless.
I really need advice on how to manage life when you seem to not trust yourself anymore.

What if you get an internship at a company that doesn't use a language you know? Do they train you, is it quick to learn if you already know how to code?"
uex2iq,3,2022-04-29,Feeling dejected after my first 0 on an assignment. How will this reflect my on my knowledge going forward? Will I be able to learn this stuff on the job/internships?,csmajor039,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uex2iq/feeling_dejected_after_my_first_0_on_an/,"I worked extremely hard on an assignment and got a 0 on it. To be fair, most people got 0s, over half the class, and the average was like 8%. I normally wouldn't care: my GPA is high and I already have an decent internship and side projects. But the assignments was EXTREMELY useful to modern technology and web infrastructure/architecture. There are a handful of people who got 100%, so it was entirely possible. But I couldn't do it.

It was essentially to create a cloud server to host a site with authentication, several concurrent users, live-updating, etc. All coded from scratch with any libraries you find necessary. It was difficult but it wasn't that bad. But then you would get bombarded with requests and the load skyrockets. Your score is based on how much load you can handle.

I had so much difficulty figuring out how to scale up/out, monitor the load, CPU usage, memory, etc. Figuring out bottlenecks, where to scale up/out the application, modularizing different portions of the application into separate microservices and connecting them, knowing when to create separate cloud instances, all while maintaining the original functionality of the application, mostly the authentication and live-updating part. I knew none of this going into the course. Everything I had to google or figure out myself, and the TAs/professor gave vague advice because he wanted us to figure it out ourselves (he would tell us the ""what to do"" and ""why"" but not ""how to do it"", barely any hints in that regard either). I found myself either looking at docs for hours and not understanding, or just endlessly googling how to connect and organize this entire architecture, without much to show for it.

I don't know. I just feel stupid right now. I couldn't care less about my GPA, I just wanted to finish an actually useful project and be proud that I could do this stuff, but I couldn't. Not some basic CRUD app but an entire system. In any case, my GPA is high because of classes like discrete math, algorithms, basic systems/assembly, nothing as relevant as this course.

Are jobs/internships nearly as difficult as this? Will there be guided learning? My imposter syndrome is starting to kick in and I'm really feeling like I'll struggle a lot in the real world especially since I put so much time into this project and there's still so much I don't understand in terms of how to do these things."
uex4jy,4,2022-04-29,I am Boxer - don't be,thx1138guy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uex4jy/i_am_boxer_dont_be/,"Boxer was the workhorse who did all of the heavy lifting in the George Orwell novel 'Animal Farm'.  I assume that most Americans 50 and older have read this book more than once in their lifetime.  For those younger who haven't it's high time you picked it up as it very well could help save your sanity while employed by corporations with thousands of employees.

Why am I Boxer?  Because I'm now only 7 months away from retirement and have just realized that following the rules and doing a good job does not matter much when others blatantly flaunt them and don't do a good job.  I suppose it has always been this way and I was just oblivious to this, until now.

Like Boxer, I complete more work than anyone else in my department and I also do it better than the others.  I go to the office every week day and rarely work from home even though I'm allowed to do so one day per week.  I go in because there's not much I can work on at home.  The type of work I do requires that I be onsite 95% of the time.  That doesn't stop a few of my colleagues from 'working from home' when it's obvious that they don't have enough that they can do there.  They charge time to projects knowing full well that they did little to nothing that day at home.  And, they get away with it.  They always get away with it.  Somehow, the bosses either don't notice or care. 

We had an intern in our department the prior six months who did almost no work during the last four.  He was paid $20 per hour and learned almost nothing while with us.  He avoided work by not doing an acceptable job when asked.  My boss did nothing to correct this behavior even though he was approached about it a few times.  The intern apparently surmised that by doing a shitty job that no one would give him any assignments allowing him to complete his homework for his BS in Engineering and otherwise sit at his desk all day with his feet on his desk watching videos or playing video games on his iPhone.   Today was his last day and he has been hired as an engineer at another manufacturing company.  Good riddance, La-Z-Boy!  And good luck to the manager who just hired him, you'll need it!

So, fortunately, it is time for me to leave after 40 years with the bridle on my head.  I wish my last day had been today.  And I also wish I weren't Boxer but old habits are hard to break.  At least I won't be sold to the glue factory."

uexjeo,1,2022-04-29,"I'm pretty sure the hiring manager meant well, but it was more soul-crushing than encouraging",sgy0003,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uexjeo/im_pretty_sure_the_hiring_manager_meant_well_but/,"Got a phone call after an interview for a data analyst internship a few days ago. The HM guy seemed great during interview, and I was sure it was gonna be the good news. But nope, he wanted to tell me they chose more promising candidates. If he had ended the call there I would've appreciated physically calling me instead of sending me one of those generic rejection emails.

But then he added something at the end. He said (not word for word but pretty much):

""You know OP, we have openings at the service desk at our office. I think you should apply there. If you want, you can send me the resume so we can go over how to stand out"".

First off,  the way he said it really demoralized me. All the time I took to learn the skills and doing projects meant nothing, and he made it sound like I'm only good for a desk job. Secondly, the resume was meant to stand out. It highlights my experience not only in data analytics but some other desk and computer skills. And that's not good enough for a position that anyone can get?

I don't blame the dude. I really don't. He was just doing his job and it's in his right to pick the best candidate. But man, his words seriously crushed my already shattered self-esteem"
uexpjj,1,2022-04-29,Deciding Between Some Internship Options,disgruntledJavaCoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uexpjj/deciding_between_some_internship_options/,"I'm a rising college senior in CS in the United States. I've had three internships up to now. First one was doing general SWE at a small (recent IPO, after my time there) company that uses Java. Second was supposed to be at a webdev company but it got cancelled due to COVID--fortunately I ended up being a research assistant for a professor at my school, not doing that much development but some scripting for data processing. Most recent was at a smallish (but has been around for ~30 years) company, on the research team researching and implementing some algorithms in their C++ codebase. I got return offers from both companies but didn't take them because I don't think they're a great fit for me right now.

I got a late start on internships this year for many reasons and it was looking like I screwed myself, but thankfully some options have come up now--one offer so far. I'm just having some trouble deciding between the potential options. For arguments' sake, pretend that the timeline isn't an issue and I have offers from all three.

* DevOps Engineer Intern, medium-sized company that makes healthcare software. Offer in hand; needs decision within 3 days. $25/hr, fully remote.

Not the most fun industry, but doing DevOps instead should keep it interesting. Company culture seems to be good as my interviewers had been there for a while. I'd rather be in-person with reasonable (&lt;= 1hr) commute at this stage in my career but I've had two in-person internships before and I want to be near school this summer. Also, there may be a catch (vesting schedule?) but the offer letter I received seems to say I'm eligible for 5% matching on a 401k there, which I had no idea companies *ever* did for interns.

I don't want to pigeonhole myself into DevOps but I enjoyed the bit of DevOps I've done so far and I think the experience could be very valuable for my career goals. I'm a bit less concerned about pigeonholing as I've had those SWE internships before and won't stay in DevOps for long, if at all past this summer.

* Software Engineer Intern, medium-sized company that makes IoT software. Likely ~$25/hr. Waiting on final decision from them.

Seems like a very cool place with interesting subject matter, though some reviews say the management has strange priorities. This is certainly a more natural fit for me. However, they want me to be fully in-person... at their headquarters several states away. They provide housing, but with how far it is from me I'd essentially be gone for almost the entire summer and the area doesn't seem that interesting. I don't want to lose the last summer I'll have with my college friends in one place. Is this naive?

I told them I got an offer from another company and needed to make my decision on Monday. Unfortunately, this company told me they are still deciding and wouldn't have an answer for me today.

* Software Engineer Intern, large engineering company but on the smaller software-dev team. Likely a bit below $25/hr. Still in the interview process: They're moving slowly and have delayed my *screening* call once already, but it's this Tuesday.

Given how slowly they're moving and them not being a tech company, this is not a major candidate for me, but it's still in the cards and I'll keep talking to them. This is mostly in-person and an hour commute which I'm fine to do.

---

So, essentially the choice is 1) take offer for remote DevOps, 2) maybe get an offer in time on relocated SWE at interesting company, 3) gamble and hope for an offer on in-person SWE at typical company. I could kick the tires on other places but I'm not looking to. My leaning is the DevOps internship. But I wanted to check these questions: Is it a bad idea to go remote for this internship even with prior experience? Am I risking my SWE career by interning in DevOps? Am I being ridiculous by not wanting to relocate for the summer?"

Should be more like ""As a student soon to graduate, where will my time be best spent in order to get my first job?""

I'll be done with classes for a bachelor's degree in CS by the end of the year. Between work, school, and my wife and kids, I recognize that I don't have much time left to improve my odds at landing my first job. So where should I be focusing my time and energy?

* Internship
   * Feels like I'm a little too late for this one at this point in the year, but I am currently working as a student DBA at my university (better than nothing, but it's obviously not quite in line with software development). Should I still bother trying to get an internship this late in the season?
* Personal Projects / Portfolio
   * I've heard some say that having projects hardly matters at all, and many others seem to see it as critical. Frankly, I'm also a little intimidated by the prospect of building a whole app on my own. Is it worth it to have a portfolio, or could I get by doing open source and LeetCode?
* Open Source Contributions
   * It seems like contributing to open source code would be good practice for cooperating with other developers, but would it be better to just be making my own project instead? Any insights about what most companies seem to prefer on a resume?
* LeetCode
   * I understand that practicing coding assessments is important these days. Any advice on how often I should be practicing? Should I bother trying to get good at solving hard problems? Or is easy to medium enough?

Bonus question, any advice about doom scrolling on this subreddit? I'm glad that I follow it so that I'm more anxious to be prepared, but sometimes it's hard not to feel like the job search will inevitably take months and be miserable.

Thanks for the help."

Since Cornell is considered in the middle of nowhere and is in the east coast (instead of west where majority of the tech companies are), do companies such as microsoft google etc. come down to Cornell to pick interns. Or is there a way to apply to intern at those firms? 

Similarly, what’s the scene for on campus recruiting post graduation."

I know that the jobs for software engineers even starting out of college are pretty high including jobs that aren’t at FAANG. Should I take out loans? I also have a shot at getting the Evans Scholarship sophomore year so I would only need loans for the first year. (I also have a back up plan at a different college if I don’t get the scholarship, but UIUC is my dream) I also applied and got accepted to my community college’s UIUC engineering pathways program. Are the opportunities at UIUC worth it to go all four years? I’m just afraid if I transfer into junior year that I’ll miss out on opportunities like hackathons, research, internships, connections, mentors, etc (which will will help me get a swe job or maybe grad school). Any advice on what I should do?"
uf052w,2,2022-04-29,Inadvertently recruited for Equity Research Associate at major bank?,riversiderain,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/uf052w/inadvertently_recruited_for_equity_research/,"Hi all, I'm a new/recent grad in computer science and communication studies, job searching in tech (Product Manager, Software Dev, Dev Ops, Sysadmin, etc). I've don't have any internship experience, but have some strong qualifications across education, business, computer programming, e.g.: owning and operating a small franchisee business since 3 years ago, community building, political volunteering, technological volunteering.

Yet, I recently received an interview request at (Major Canadian Bank)'s Capital Markets branch while signing up for their campus webinars/""coffee chats"". I never even thought of a career in Finance, but after researching as much as I could on the position of Equity Research Associate, I'm intrigued, and want to take this interview seriously. However, I lack strong background on much of the concrete skills and background knowledge required, beyond what was necessary with my business, learning interests, personal accounting, and casual passive investment &amp; stock trading. I have a friend who's an expert in numismatics and ancient monetary history, so I've learned an unusual subset on economic history, I suppose.

I've learned that due to massive turnover, there's a huge wave of demand from major institutions for Equity Research [- one vlogger reporting as much as 20 junior hires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr3HTYq4VoY) in the year (I think).

I'm not fully sure what all I should be asking here, frankly. 

* What do I have to know for this position aside from what was laid out in the [FMVA program recommended in the career map](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/map/banks/equity-research-analyst-career/)? Is it even feasible to aim for this certificate in the 2-3 weeks (or less) I have to prepare for the Behavioural Interview with the VP?

* Aside from stock pitches, what are the most important qualities a sell-side major bank would want in an ER Associate?

* What is the current state of computer programming influence in ER? I've heard of automation eating into ER, but what exactly is the threat there - stepping on Excel's shoes or actually replacing an Associate's legwork? 

* Might we be in a labour market for ER, considering massive turnover + demand? Could it be feasible to negotiate for some semblance of WLB?

  * It seems that in a world with /r/overemployed, it doesn't make sense to work 65-80 hrs/wk for a salary of $100k-150k that you could make with two jobs, less stress, and less time. Me personally, I'd have to give up my business in order to pursue this, so the idea of going from business owner working 80 hrs/wk *(albeit making little money)* to another job working 80 hrs/wk *(at the analyst's and market's whim)* would need to have something more compelling than ""the experience.""

Please let me know anything yall think, I'd be happy to learn from your discussion and recommendations."

Feel free to answer any of these questions or all Thank you for your time in advance.

First question I don't have any internships and my GPA is right below a 3 so will not be including that on my resume. I think machine learning is really cool and I am fascinated by it however due to my lack of internships or GPA would a few summer projects on a portfolio be enough to land me an entry position.

Secound question  would it be viable to go from .net developer or standard se to a job more focused on machine learning.

Third question I plan on busting my ass over the summer and turning out 3-4 in depth projects should I spread these out across multiple areas such as one being web dev focused one ML focused and one general algorithm focused or should I throw all my effort into one area. Note I do plan on having a flashy portfolio site to catch recruiters eye.

Final question would graduating in December pose any challenges is their a drop off companies hiring new grads.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!"

I've been thinking about moving out and living on my own, but I'm not sure. I'm 18 years old and in my junior year of high school (yes I know I'm old for my grade level, it's a long story). I've never had a stable home life. 

Last year my very mentally ill mom burned the house we were renting down, and my older sister and I have been living with our grandma. My grandma has a very small house. My older sister and I sleep in the living room (she takes the couch and I have an air Mattress). I have a plastic bin that all of my stuff resides in. My mom lost custody of my younger sister to one of my sister's friends. 

I've been thinking of moving out for a while, amd now that I'm 18 I'm not sure. One of my friends turns 18 this summer, and he plans on moving out as soon as possible. We're thinking of getting a place together here in town (I live in missoula montana). Financially we could pull it off. It would be tight, but we could do it. The main reason I want to move out is to have my own space, which I have none of at my grandmas. 

I'm a 4.0 student taking AP classes, and to get any homework done I have to go to a coffee shop or the library (my grandma doesn't have wifi and she makes it really difficult to concentrate). My main concern is that I could get so focused on trying to live that school gets left behind. But at the same time I'm not sure I can keep being productive at school living with my grandma. In terms of finances, I work at as an electrical engineering intern, and my hours are kinda sporadic (it depends on how busy the office is). 

I trust my friend to pay his part of the bills, if we were to get a place together. I'm also concerned about college. Should I tough it out one more year and save some money for college? I'm just not sure what to do with my position. If you guys have any advice or want to share your experience, I would be very grateful."

I’ve been applying for jobs left and right since March (although not as actively as now), but get rejected or never hear back from them.

I've worked part time mostly and studied part time. I've completed my qualification, but my professional career has not taken off yet. The previous 3 jobs I've had has been the worst jobs. I've worked as a game dev for just less than a year. Initially, this was the best job ever. I did well and gained experience, despite working under an intern. I basically carried the team, until they were fired. I was kept and was given a new task. I'm more of an introvert and was required to speak in front of the camera, which didn't work out. I was then required to do a really boring job of video editing. I was so bored of this job that I decided to leave. I eventually joined the company again as a game dev. After a few weeks, there was a problem with their mobile app. I was dumb and overambitious and decided to redevelop the app. I also gave a deadline of 2 months, which I think till this day, was absolutely ridiculous of me. As time passed, I was able to get a basic version of the app out. After that, things took a turn for the worst. I started working on the premium version of the app and the entire project just spiraled out of control. I wasn't meeting deadlines and I even messed up so badly that I ended up losing source code. I was at the lowest point and decided to resign immediately. 
I then found another job of maintaining a website, graphic design, some HR and general office work. I found this job boring and messed up on various occasions. The managers wife would always shout at me and humiliate me to the point where I was becoming burned out. One of my coworkers thought I came to work drunk because I looked so drained and worn out. I then decided to resign. I left on very good terms with my boss and he said that he would give me a good reference in the future.
Few weeks ago I applied for a job as a web developer. I didn't really have knowledge of the tech stack, but I was able to learn it in a few days. I passed the interview and was offered the position. All was good until I was given a task to fix errors in the company's source code. I felt so hopeless and defeated by these 2 problems. I would sit and stare at the screen thinking about my future and planning on how I would resign. On the sixth day of the job I was given a warning for slow progress. That's when I decided to quit.
I came back home, told my mother and her boyfriend and they both got really aggressive. Her boyfriend even threatened me to go back and withdraw, which I agreed to because I didn't want the situation to escalate.
I was then convinced that I had no chance of progressing in my current field. At that point, I even decided to change careers and study something else.
I spent the past 2 days trying to take my mind of my problems. I took a trip to my childhood neighborhood and went to see some of my friends that I haven't seen in almost 11 years. I took long strolls to the beach and watched the waves in the ocean. I walked a really long distance until my feet were sore, ate lunch at a Cafe, had ice cream, gave some money to the poor and visited places that I had good childhood memories of.
I've been crying everyday ever since then (in fact, I'm doing it right now), mostly because I told my grandmother I've found a good job and I'll be moving in back with her to take care of her. Suicide has even crossed my mind on multiple occasions. I honestly wouldn't think that my decision would make my grandmother change her mind, but how can I go back if I don't have a stable income?
I'll be moving into a temporary shelter until I can stand on my own two feet and actually find something I enjoy doing. The shelter is clean, well maintained and I have enough money to stay for around 10 months (I obviously won't be staying there for that long).

My plan right now is to hang tight, find a job outside my field, until I get a graduate position where I am able to receive training and mentorship. I just need some advice from anyone who has been in a similar position and what did you do to overcome it?"

I'm about to move to NYC to start a 5 months internship with the UN. I'll have to survive on a stipend, so money will be very tight, but I'm still super excited.

But!

I've struggled with mental illness for a very long time. Primarily depression and anxiety. I come from a European country where the job market is complete horsesh*t, so I had to move to Germany to study and now work (although I hate my job and it's low paid, but it's still better than what I'd have found back home). And generally I have a hard time finding friends because I have crippingly low self esteem and always feel that I deserve no one.

Over my years abroad I came this close several times to taking my own life due to the general stress and overwhelming reality of living on my own, away from my family. I would cry every day and spend insane amounts of money to take planes nearly every weekend to be with my family. Sometimes I wasn't able to sleep or study at all. I was a complete mess.

In the end, I somehow survived. And I managed. I graduated, I made new wonderful friends. I got lucky during the pandemic because everyone was working remotely so I just went back home and got a free stay with my family card for months. I got into therapy. I grew.

Fast forward to now. I work full time in Munich and I was just starting to find my own balance. I have a place to stay - it's small and terrible, but it's still a place to stay. I work from home, which keeps me more relaxed and relieves me from anxiety. I can visit my family everytime I want (theoretically) by hopping on a plane, which I wouldn't do because it's expensive due to post-rona prices, but it's still an option that keeps me mentally stable. I still have Skype calls with my therapist and just get by. Munich is the polar opposite to NYC when it comes to cities - spacious, quiet, cosy, full of green spaces, perfect for getting into the nature. It's what I need.

Now, unexpectedly, I got this offer from the UN. And of course it's an offer that I want and need to take. It's only a few months after all, and it would be a killer line on my CV - I'd be able to return to Europe right afterwards and maybe even find a good paying job in my own country. And I mean, it's NYC. How can you not be excited to move to NYC.

But I'm still terrified.

NYC is large. It's expensive. It's crammed. It's dirty and messy. It's difficult. People are pushy and in a rush. Summers can be unbearably hot. I'm used to large green spaces, a quiet life and the mountains and NYC is just the opposite of that. I'm turning 31 this year and the prospect of going back to the broke student lifestyle is off putting. I know no one there - never been there, never even been overseas for that matter. I'll be starting very soon and the idea of having to find a place to stay and survive on an internship stipend is daunting. No one can help me and be there for me. My family and friends could not come visit. I could not spend weekends going hiking somewhere nice or visiting a cute little town nearby - it's too far and too expensive. It would just be all completely the opposite of what I'm used too, and what's kept me stable and sane so far. I'm terrified that I'll break down HARD and get swallowed back into the depths of mental illness.

But I still need to take up this opportunity. I would regret it for my entire life if I didn't. And please don't get me wrong, I know this sounds like ""omg NYC is so terrible help me survive in this hellhole"" but it really isn't. NYC sounds like an amazing place but it also can be hard on someone like me.

I know part of this is my brain trying to sabotage myself and keep me from going. I even posted another thread here on this sub saying that I'm worried about nuclear war between Russia and the US and a bomb targeting the city. That's how poorly I am managing the situation atm.

The sane part of me also knows that this is such a cool, wonderful opportunity and I get to spend months in the most exciting place on Earth. But it's difficult to really understand that when your mind is shrouded in fear and anxiety.

I would just like to ask you if anyone of you has ever dealt with something similar, and if you have any tips to cope with this situation. It would be tremendously helpful for this poor troubled soul.

Thank you all and have a lovely Saturday."

So let me tell you a but about myself, i have no programming experience, i graduated with a software engineering degree but i almost knew nothing about the subject.

I worked outside the industry for a few years, got let go in 2020 with the start of the pandemic, decided i want to get back into programming.

So i studied hard (maybe not hard enough?), and started applying for jobs, now i got the internship more than a week ago, and they're letting me work on the application directly.

The tasks they assign to me seem very simple, but i always feel that im struggling with them more than i should be.

Every one on the team has 5+ years experience.

So what i want to ask is:

1.what should be my expectations of myself going down the road? 
2.what are they expecting of me?
3.is it just an imp0ster syndrome or am i lacking in skill?
4. What can i do to improve myself, besides studying?

ufgir5,3,2022-04-30,Should I move out of my dorm to go live with my grandfather?,ParrotRiley,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ufgir5/should_i_move_out_of_my_dorm_to_go_live_with_my/,"***TL;DR: I'm a student, currently living in a dorm. Student life is expensive. My lonely grandfather lives closer to my college than I currently do in my dorm, so I'm considering moving in with him. Please share your own experiences, thoughts or possible issues that could arise.***

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, I'm a nursing student (M/19). I moved in a dorm at the start of the year. Most of the other students there have the advantage that their parents pay for their stay and groceries entirely. I'm not as lucky, I try to keep my monthly expenses at the bare minimum, my parents still only cover just over half of them. Each and every month, I still end up taking 400 USD from my savings that I earned through my four years of working parttime. I'm no longer able to work on a regular basis because of internships and studying.

&amp;#x200B;

What could be more ideal, is moving in with my grandpa who lives even closer to my college than my dorm room is. My grandma passed last month, and one of my grandpa's legs is amputated. He feels lonely and he requires home care at least once a day. I've been thinking about how much money I could save if I moved in with him - not only that, but it would also give him purpose in life again. I'm especially interested to hear feedback on this from others who have moved in with relatives during college.

&amp;#x200B;

Some advantages I can think of:

1. Since his leg is amputated, he is only able to reach the first floor using a small escalator. The stairway to the second floor does not have one of those, which would mean I could get the second floor (quite a spacious bedroom and office) to myself. He would have no way of getting up there. Basically means my privacy is a guarantee. This also means that we also each still have our own space.

2. My monthly expenses would be significantly lower as I assume I wouldn't have to pay rent anymore - worst case scenario I still have to pay a small amount, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as much as my current dorm.

3. It will make my grandpa happy: he feels isolated from the world. He doesn't even have a garden. The best thing he can do is roll up to the front door, open it and look at the people passing by. My father, aunts and uncles aren't actually his children. My grandma had all her kids with a previous partner. They don't feel the need to visit as much as they did when grandma was still alive. If I moved in with grandpa, I guess as a nursing student I could assist him (I don't mean cancelling home care and having me doing it all, I just mean helping my grandpa when home care is unable to, or the issue he requires help for isn't severe enough for home care to come and help)

4. He lives closer to my college than my current dorm is. (0,6 miles compared to the current 1,1 miles)

5. Despite now living in one of the most popular areas among students, I don't actually make use of it that much. I almost never go out to nightclubs (I prefer making things cosy with the other students at my dorm). A lot of people praise me for my dorm location and tell me how jealous they are and how they would party all night.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible disadvantages I could think of:

1. Moving in with your grandparents is a whole other level than just visiting them every so often. I love my grandfather, and I like visitting him, but I'm scared that I wouldn't feel the same way anymore if I would spend nearly all of my time in his house. Maybe moving in will be difficult for him as well - maybe we disagree on certains things which may lead to further conflict.

2. If it turns out we aren't actually compatible to live together, I will have lost my dorm by that point, and they are extremely difficult to find these days. I got extremely lucky and found a somewhat affordable dorm with private kitchen and sanitary right in the most popular area among the students. If things with grandpa wouldn't work out, I would have to start all over from scratch again to find a similar dorm.

&amp;#x200B;

**Please, fellow students &amp; adults who have been in similar situations: share your own experiences, thoughts or possible issues that could arise.**"

I dont know why I'm worried, I've never been terminated or near termination at my jobs. I've been told by peers that termination only happens if you are constantly late, slacking or performed some misconduct. Though I do know I have a habit of forgetting things when under pressure. 

My friends all said internships and co-op roles are pretty chill, but the interviewers said their company gets busy in the summer, and they need some more help. Im thinking my circumstances might be different. The starting wage is also pretty high (though all of their intern and lower positions start at that level).

COLLEGE B = TAMPA

Hey y’all as you know the day to decide is tomorrow but I need to figure it out today! I’m leaning towards college B but my parents have it as their last choice for me to go (it’s INDIANA, PURDUE, MICH STATE , Penn state , boulder) . I obv chose where I go but you know how parents are. 

Some background info of me is that I trade cryptocurrency, created a few crypto coins, I teach trading skills n charge subscription base and I’m open to internship and hands on business. Im someone going to college looking for connections and opportunities and not much the learning, but academics still important. Forget to mention I’m taking a cyber security verticals course online in the summer but it will last through 2nd semester college. 


College A: Boulder has a super nice location , I love to snowboard and am a sorta outdoor person. Pros would be good biz and cybersecurity programs. Big alumni network and obviously semi close to the city of Denver. Cons are no bar life since when I went the bar life there was super minimum. Boulder is also super expensive (*60K per year*) I also have 40+ kids from my school going. 

Collage B: smaller school about 10,000 kids. Pros: In the city of tampa so good connections to company’s. 100K cheaper than boulder. Money is not an issue as it would be fully paid for either college I go to but if I were to go to a cheaper college I would hope to be able to get some of the difference for an after college fund or something . Pros also are that it’s newer buildings and that there are bulidng a lot of new stuff. CONS are the small alumni network and that it’s not a well known school . Parents things it’s a bad school . 

I’m leaning tampa but I have my doubts"

ufj6ho,202,2022-04-30,"Software development is more than programming - soft skills are as important as hard skills, sometimes more",tzaeru,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ufj6ho/software_development_is_more_than_programming/,"For a short background, I've been programming professionally a little over ten years. Last three years as a consultant. I'm quite active on various learning communities and also do a little bit of this and that with a few non-profit orgs.

I'm a very different kind of a software developer and a contributor than I was when I first started my career.

When I was in my early teens and learning to code, the prevailing attitude in programming communities was snark when ever certain keywords like communication skills, being friendly, being a team player, etc, were mentioned. It was a meme, basically, that programmers were required to have more than hard skills.

But the older I've gotten the more I've come to realize how deeply childish this attitude was.

When I started my career, I was kind of one of those stereotypical introvert coders, who snickered at the idea that a great software developer was something else than a great programmer.

In a lot of ways, the prevailing attitudes have changed, even among the freshlings. I was quite clearly reminded of this when I was visiting the introduction event for the summer trainees and interns for the company I work with. A lot of these future developers, aged 19-25, were really eager to be participating in such an event. They seemed just happy to be there and there when they introduced themselves, they didn't withdraw or try to avoid participating. They talked a bit about themselves and it didn't seem like something they felt repulsion about - even if it was a bit awkward for some, as group situations can be very awkward to certain kind of personalities.

This contrasts to myself. I was withdrawn, only cared about coding, didn't want to participate in anything extra, and albeit I was mostly friendly, I was also quite sarcastic and not too into any sort of meetings or anything that, I felt, was tangential to software development.

But the thing is - **software development is not the same as coding.**

Software development is a lot more. It's mapping out client needs, it's discussing tech choices with the colleagues, it's functioning well as a team. It's making software that actually is useful and creates value.

You can be a technically genius programmer but create software that is worthless because it doesn't actually generate value to the client, because you misunderstood what the client really needs.

You can be a great programmer, but if your personality is hard to get along with, your presence in the team might be demotivating and your net impact on the project might even be negative.

**Soft skills**, like ""hard"" skills, **are skills that can - and need to - be developed and practiced.**

Some of us get stuck telling ourselves about who we are and by doing so too much, we remove our chances to develop as a person. Myself for long I excused lackluster participation and behavior by saying things like, I'm introvert; I'm not a people's person; etc. But the actual truth was that I was s*hy* because I was *anxious*. I let my anxieties stop me from developing my team skills which, for a good time, lagged behind my hard skills.

In future, the need to understand technology is only getting more and more important. People with good soft skills who aren't too interested in getting deep with the tech still need to understand the basics if they want to work in a tech company.

And on the other hand, people with hard skills must have enough soft skills to be able to function in a team developing software. Often, the most important person in the team is not the technically best programmer, but the person who helps the team get organized, interacts with the client and understands the demands for the project.

I suppose what I'd like to say is that if you do feel like people skills are something that aren't your thing, you need to still be have them on a specific level. Don't be afraid of developing them either. They're a skill, and they need time and practice to hone. Like a people's person is going to need a specific level of understanding of technology to be able to function, a tech person needs a specific level of people skills to be able to function optimally.

This can also help you greatly in getting your first job. If you show interest and appear like a friendly person, your chances of getting hired increase markedly. You don't have to communicate perfectly - lots of geeks stutter, take awkward pauses, etc, and it's totally fine and those things \*are not\* synonymous with bad soft skills - but you don't want to appear like someone who's uninterested in their soft skills."

Background:
Computer Science Engineer from well ranked regional school in India with a specialization in Analytics (Non IIT/NIT)

GPA - 6.7/10  ||  (Final Year 8/10)

No excuses, I'm the first engineer in my family and had a lot of pressure growing up. Once I entered undergrad I believed my seniors who said GPA doesn't matter and took tons of extracurriculars to explore life.
Eventually saw the light and worked my ass off in the final two years (also got placed on campus in the company paying max $ with the lowest GPA ever coz I had loans to pay)

GRE - 316 (Q163, V153, AWA 4)
Can't do better than this, took the GRE twice. As good as it gets.

Total YOE : 4.5 by Matriculation

2 yrs as a Software Release Manager in IT Services with 1 promotion ( Think Cognizant, Accenture, Capgemini working for a US Banking client ) where I received a pat on the back award for automating stuff for my client saving significant $$

1.5 yrs in Big 4 Tech Consulting (Front End not Global back office.)
&gt;Promotion from A.Con to Consultant within 3 months of joining. Won't have another promotion by Jan 23' now unless I jump ship.

Also received an appreciation award for taking initiatives in the firm (led a nation wide technology training initiative for new analysts)

(WE: ERP/EPM Implementations + Project Management)

Tons of extracurriculars during undergrad, College Magazine Editor, Cultural Fests Leadership Positions, AIESEC Team Lead, Volunteer work at a few NGO's

3 Internships in total during undergrad.
1. Software Development with a local startup
2. Digital Marketing Internship in a Five Star Hospitality Chain
3. Final Software Dev Internship at a MBB Tech Office

Extra Info : Played sports at a National Level in 12th Grade (Gold at a State level), Also into Photography and have a decent online portfolio.

I was wondering what red flags I should look for, how to behave in an interview and at what part of the selection process I should start asking about the pay (99% of the job postings don't have a salary range, and since it's my first job I feel it would turn companies away if I started asking about money upfront). Please, if you have any tips on how to choose and apply to a company, let me know!  


(inflation has hit hard and it has become increasingly difficult for my parent to make ends meet. I don't want to come off as greedy but pay is really important. For conversion purposes, 1 USD = 5 of my country's currency and the minimum hourly wage here is about R$ 6.30 an hour. The minimum American wage, $ 7.5/hour, is about 6x more than what I could make at an entry level job here, so there's a reason why an international opportunity, even if a bad one, would be great)."

Do employees prefer certificates from LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Udemy or are there better ones to get. For reference, I am a new grad who has a 16 month internship completed looking to enhance my technical skills to stand out."

For example, Squaretrade had a listing and the salary is between 50 and 60k. This sounds too good to be true for someone without a degree and I hoped some of you folks might have some insight. The listing is for the Denver area(I’m moving there in August). 

Thanks for any info!"
uflwtl,33,2022-04-30,I PASSED ! Security +,WoodenPersonality290,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/uflwtl/i_passed_security/,"Just got done with the exam . Passed with a 761 .

I walked in with a positive mindset , played music to get me amped &amp; all .
( I took the test at home , not as bad as people made it good experience.)

I used nothing but messer , from practice exams , YouTube videos &amp; notes . I used dion practice test , didn’t get to far based on the fact the wording had me falling asleep in the practice exams.
Pocket Prep helped me ready as well. Didn’t get to far as well because I hate being on my phone because my concentration level is nonexistent because of the multiple texts , social media and more.

Study your ports !

( The exams is close to messer exams )

My experience in IT : I went from a Data Center Support , Intern as a Security Analyst. I am also graduating in Cyber Security ( Information in Security &amp; Assurance )

I studied for 1 month &amp; 2 weeks ."
ufms2f,13,2022-04-30,I cried at work and I’m so embarrassed,Last_Instance_9519,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ufms2f/i_cried_at_work_and_im_so_embarrassed/,"I’ve been at my company for a year, and it’s been very high stress. My manager quit 4 months ago and there’s no re-hire in sight for another 4 months, so the entire department has just been me and an intern. It’s a lot of responsibility and I’ve been trying my best to work with the flow and handle all these changes, but it’s been a lot. More importantly, I thought I’ve been handling these changes pretty well and I’ve been doing all my work and then some, trying to get us ready for our product launch at the end of the year. I feel like I should be getting appreciated a lot more for the crap I’ve had to put up with.

I’m a 23 year old and I report to two pretty big personality/blunt CEOs now since my manager quit. They’re a lot older and I feel like they belittle me &amp; don’t respect me. I get called “young” and a kid a lot. I’ve tried telling them how I feel about certain things going on in the org structure, but it seems like they don’t want to hear it and I get a lot of pushback. One of the things I brought up recently is that I have to manage the intern for the last 4 months, but they don’t want to give me a supervisor title or call me the intern’s direct report. Instead, the CEO is the intern’s manager, but he’s never even spoken to her. They said that I’m too young and it doesn’t fit in the org structure to call me a supervisor. 

Besides that, there’s an issue going on with our product and I talked to some of my coworkers about it. Then I got reprimanded by each CEO that there’s a level of maturity when handling these situations and that I shouldn’t be “creating noise” in the office. I was pissed off because it seems like they’re blaming me for office gossip or something, when in reality people were already talking about this before I even knew. Plus I was mostly talking about it with coworkers to ask for help, not just gossip. 

Anyways, all these things were building up and one of my trusted coworkers I’m close with asked me to come to her office to chat about some project. She asked me how my meeting went with the CEO, and I started having tears come down my eyes. I apologized and told her sorry, I just didn’t have the best meeting right now and it’s been a lot of stress. She said it’s ok and handed me a tissue, and said don’t worry no one else can see or will know. She also asked if I wanted to go out to lunch this weekend and talk about it more. It could have been a lot worse, but I’m so embarrassed and don’t know what to do. I’m really hating myself right now and wish I handled things better."
