It's near the end of the day, and an elderly couple bring in their computer complaining that it does not get past the windows boot screen. We write a work order for them and they depart.

The other technician in the building takes the computer into the shop, plugs it in and 

****BAM****

out go the lights, up goes the surge protector, pants: dutifully replaced.

after a few calming breaths, we stop and take stock of the situation, piecing together what happened.

Apparently the power jack on the powersupply was loose. it would occasionally shift or wiggle when kicked and the computer would lose power. We speculated this was what bricked windows. 

The elderly husband, being clever enough to figure out the issue, figured that if the power jack wasn't loose then the computer wouldn't randomly shut down. So to that end, he grabbed an **uninsulated piece of copper wire** that was laying around **and jammed it into the power supply jack to prevent the power cable from shifting.**

Somehow managing to avoid an entry in the Darwin awards, the computer eventually fails to boot, and they take it to our shop. This was when the copper wire, no longer insulated by the connector, had now bridged the ground and 120V wire. When the tech plugged in the power cable, it formed a bridge, melted the cable, blew up our surge protector, and ruined my pants.

I'll never forget the image of that power cable, ground wire melted through the insulation, jutting out the side. 

Always check the jack, kids."

Cousin linked me to thread and now has ruined my productivity forever, but at least I get to get this off my chest. (Sorry I wrote a novel. D:)

This happened a few weeks ago when I was starting my summer internship.
During the last few weeks of school, an acquaintance, Doug*, contacted me about making some art for his startup project and if the others at the office liked it, then I would have a summer internship. Thought this would be good because I would be getting experience and some disposable income. So I did the art and Doug said I was pretty much on the team but they wanted an interview first. I've never done a formal interview before or even worn anything near business attire so I was freaking out kinda hard the days leading towards the interview. To make it worse, I also had to wake up early (after a regular college sleeping schedule of sleeping at ungodly hours and waking up in the late afternoon) and drive downtown where the streets are narrow and confusing. This would have not been a problem but I don't get much practice driving while in college far away so I still get nervous while driving unfamiliar roads. Anyways...

Fast forward: day of the interview. I managed to wake up and make myself look presentable and put on the hideous and bound-to-cause-blisters ""business"" heels. I estimated that it would take me 20 minutes to get to work, so left promptly with that. However, traffic might've been a little bit crazier that day but I survived morning commute and merging with busy traffic (I need an award for this)... but problem arises when I find the office and of course, downtown has no parking. I also realize it's 8:59 and my interview was at 9. Oops, casually started to panic because the interview tips I read said I should've arrived at least 4 minutes ago. Anyways, I just focus on the first task of parking the damn car and follow this other car into what seems like parking garage. I parked in a random spot (lightly tapping a cement pole in the process because my panicked state affected my depth of perception, sorry mom) and totally ignored the numbers printed on the ground and also the fact that there are closed gates everywhere. Whatever, I'm late and I'm just trying to get to the office.

Alright well, the car is parked but where the fuck am I. Frantically searching for a way out, I literally saw the light- as in sunlight through glass, aka OUTDOORS!!! Mildly rejoicing, heads towards that direction and see a way out: a glass doorway thing (more rejoicing!). Then I fucked up. 

I don't know why the fuck I was thinking this but I was like ""hmm, I wonder why there's a door there when there's clearly a walkway right next to the door. lol this place is dumb."" Well the place probably read my mind because next thing I know I'm NOT outside but still inside and my face hurts like I just got bitch slapped by the Hulk. Took me awhile to register what just happened but the smudge marks from my face on THE WINDOW next to the door made it clearly obvious. In my head I'm thinking ""what. the. fuck. did I really. did I just. wat."" and I actually reached out and felt the freakin window that I just faceplanted into. (Mind you the whole exit was clear looking and panic-mode me just couldn't figure it out, ok.) But well fuck, no time to cry because gotta get my ass to the interview. I angrily push the actual door and finally escape from that motherfucker.

Ok well... found the building but shit there's like four different offices in there and I'm l o s t and I have no idea how my face looks (feeling swelling in lips at this point). Fuck it, I just went up the stairs and opened a random door to an office hoping for the best (because was only told it was a startup under this other dude's name but not the company name, so ggwp). Composed myself although I was crying on the inside, poked my head in, and asked if Doug was there. TYBG the receptionist said yes and he appears and I go to my interview with the head boss. I guess lucky for me that they already planned for me to be on the team so it was just small talk and getting to know the company... except the whole time I was just thinking about how swollen my lips were and how flustered I looked. But no one mentioned anything soooo...

Anyways Doug asked me where I parked and he said to just park in the lot they have behind the building. OK THANKS for telling me that after all that bullshit I went through. So I go to move my car (lmao you thought this fuck up was over BUT IT IS NOT) and realize that it's a gated parking garage. At this point I'm not surprised because life just likes to kick my butt and rub it in my face. I was only able to get in before because I followed a resident who lived in the apartment complex that the parking garage was for and thus, had no way of getting in now because everything was locked. TYBG there was some maintenence guy with keys who opened the pedestrian gate for me. I sprinted like a giselle over to my car and quickly backed the fuck out of there and was able to leave the horrid place (sensors automatically opened the gate for leaving cars).

Reparked the car, walked a bit, and realized my phone wasn't in my pocket anymore... well fuck I must've dropped it when I was running to my car in the parking garage (business attire pants do not have gr8 pockets for me). SOOOO I'm back in the parking garage and had to wait for the maintenence dude to notice me again and open the door... he probably thought that I was a crazy little asian girl who is up to some sketchy business ugh. But made it in again and go look for my phone. WELL SHIT, IT'S NOT THERE. At this point, my lip is overly swollen and I'm about 5000% done with life and about to give up on everything. I exit the parking garage for THE LAST MOFOKING TIME to go look for the phone in my car and finally found it on the passenger side near the door (probably threw it over there when I was rushing to repark my car). 

The worst part is, I found out I accepted a job offer that requires me to be working from 9-5 every weekday for minimum wage and the stupid heels gave me blisters.

tl;dr Panic-mode me high fives a glass window but with my face and causes other issues."
2cbaz0,2,2014-08-01,I Need Advice on How to Clone a Drive Before it Loads Up,EChondo,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2cbaz0/i_need_advice_on_how_to_clone_a_drive_before_it/,"I'm getting a new laptop(MSI GS60) tomorrow and I would like to clone the OS drive before I startup the Windows installation. How would I go about this?

The laptop does not have an optical drive, but I do have an external one, and I also have one 8GB flashdrive and one 32GB flashdrive at my disposal.

Could I just load up Linux on a live USB and and then copy the installation partition over to my 32GB flashdrive? Or what?

Now, my reasoning as to why I want to do this? Well mainly because I want to have failsafes for my laptop just in case the OS becomes corrupt for some odd reason and since the laptop doesn't have an optical drive, then to my knowledge it doesn't come with a recovery disk. I know that MSI has a recovery partition and a recovery system setup when you press F3 upon startup, but frankly with my experiences in the past with these kinds of setups, they have failed on me.

Also, since the laptop has two M.2 slots, one will be populated already and I plan on getting a second one, so the drives might need to be erased for RAID0/1 to be setup.

Are there any Linux tools that can get this done or a piece of software that can be booted up before Windows starts up that does cloning? I used to intern at a school district and we used Ghostcasting for our imaging, but it was all server side stuff, so I'm not too sure if it can do local imaging and it also costs money.

And help will be appreciated! I have close to 4-5 years of experience with computer hardware and software, but I've never really touched imaging/cloning because I've never really needed to do it..."

It's late and I am tired, this is going to be ALL over the place, I apologize right now.

So I don't know what I am doing but I guess this is the best place to be right now. I am on a late night rant/freak out that happens every so often, where I just end up contemplating life and getting worked up about everything and anything I can think of. 

Subject tonight? Pretty simple, you know, just have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life.

So let's start at the bare bones here, I am going to be a Junior in High School this August. I am in 4 honors classes (as many as are available, why? I don't know, I suck at English, why am I there? And I don't get amazing grades, and I don't even really try, I basically just get by doing the bare minimum and I get A's and B's.) I've always been good at math and science, for some reason I suck at English, and I took Ap history because why not, might as well tack that on there. 

Anyways, I've always known that I've wanted to be something along the lines of an Engineer but that's about it, never knew what field, what exactly I wanted to be and I still have no idea. I love photography, that and building my car is one of my major passions, and I would love to do photography/videography full time but it's too shaky, never knowing when the next check will come from and I really don't think it's what I want to do, more just a phase right now. And cars I love it, but I don't know what I would do, I am not a labor person, never have been and never will be. This is all over the place I am so sorry. I love CAD programs and bridge building games and city games. I love electronics in general. I was never a destructive child, I just broke a lot of things because I took them apart and apart and apart until finally, I either lost/broke a piece or forgot how it all went together. I have things like photoshop, Inventor pro, Cinima 4D, Illistrator, all of the programs I could ever want. Computers is also a big thing for me, I love them, I love the idea and physical nature of building one from a box of parts, I love setting it up, I love figuring little kinks out with it. Back to CAD, I spent 3 years, 6 semesters from 7-9th grade in tech-ed/woodshop because I loved it, never was so much into the wood working, more the planning and the drawing and the things with CAD. We spent the first sememster of 9th grade woodshop just in Inventor, building model cars, legos, houses, city scapes, and I absolutely loved every single minute of it. I would have done it my sophomore year, done wood 3 and 4, but I needed a foreign language for college and didn't want to drop band to do both. So let's go back to my school schedule, this year will be boring but my senior year will be the good stuff. I will be doing AP Physics, AP English, AP Calc, and government, then I will do Band, and then drafting and woods 3, if I can as much into semester one, I will be able to do 3 and 4. This is still all over the place, again you know the drill, I am sorry. Let's talk a little more in depth with woods class.

My woods teacher is my favorite teacher I have ever had, he is laid back and amazing, helpful and it doesn't help that he loves me, so I get to play around with all the cool stuff haha, he has a 3d printer, two different cutter things, it's late I am sorry, that are connected to 
laptops, one cuts out plastic, one wood, and he also has a sand blaster box thing. Anyways, best teacher ever, has cool things, yes, I and I used them a ton, loved it, I designed a book style ipad case from spec sheets from apple, iphone cases, I loved it. I don't know where I was going with this, guess it could be useful.

So, I don't know, I don't know what I want to be, what I want to do. I love designing things, I love tearing things apart, I love computers, I love cars, I love it all. I want to work in a sort of place that everyone wishes they could work in, I recently watched the Internship, bear with me here guys, and loved the idea of the work place behind all of the story and what not, the sort of community, laid back, where jeans and a t-shirt sort of a place. Anyways, I don't know, guess I want advice from some wiser people, and this seemed like the place for this. Let's talk about my work shall we?

I work at McDonalds, surprise! I hate it, absolutely hate it, I wake up hoping they call me telling me they don't need me and that I can have one more day off and I don't work much more than 20 hours on a given week. I wish I could go somewhere else, but I am only 15 right now (I went into kindergarten when I was 4, so I am a grade ahead of where I should be) so there aren't many options, my birthday is next month ( I am really going to be hoping for a Prusa i3 3d printer kit if any of you know what that is, basically, they ship you a bunch of bags full of parts, you get a power supply and a couple other things, put it all together, install the firmware onto it, and onto your computer of choice and off you go) and I really want to get out of fast food, work in somewhere that doesn't treat me like cheap labor but more as an actual valuable employee with actual skills and attributes I bring to the work place. I guess I am asking for some advice here to, I think it would be good to work at some places to learn what I want to do, work at different firms or things, I don't really know what they would have me do or if they even would want me, but I have thought about calling architecture and engineering firms and talking with them, I need more than just an internship unless I just stay with McDonalds anndd work with an internship.

Help? I am sorry this was so all over the place, I am tired and on a rant, I am going into Junior year, this is supposed to be the year people tighten the last screw on what they want to do, they apply for scholarships and talk with colleges, this all seems sudden /:

If anyone actually made it through this mess, to those who didn't I understand I am sure it was a chore.

TL;DR I am 15 going to be a Junior, I don't know what I want to do. I am a mess."

2cbhaz,1,2014-08-01,"Torn between majors. Kind of leaning one way, but afraid.",omgitsrichie,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2cbhaz/torn_between_majors_kind_of_leaning_one_way_but/,"This is long. Sorry.
I've probably posted several iterations of my life story on reddit by now, but at this point, I'm seeking more spiritual advice if anything.

Back in high school, I was rather rash and naive. Took AP Computer Science, enjoyed it, decided that I might pursue a career in CS. I like working with software, I like working at a desk, and I hate dealing with the general public. Though it was too early to tell whether I was actually passionate about CS, the typical work environment seemed to at least suit my personality.

Parents said no. They doubted my abilities to compete within the top CS programs wanted me to do something they deemed more stable in health care, i.e. pharmacy, so they pushed me into pharmacy school. After a lot of fighting, I finally resigned myself to it, only because I believed their promises of an easy life with good job security, a lucrative salary, and the ability to live wherever I want. And after a year of college, I can't really say I hate it. I mean I'm breezing through and I'm pretty confident I'll get my degree.

But after reading how saturated the job market has become and how absolutely miserable I am with my internship at Walgreens (I hate standing on my feet all day to deal with irate customers and the fast-paced environment is really overwhelming), I'm reconsidering. The vast majority of pharmacists end up working retail in rural areas, and while my strong academic standing might secure me a limited residency opportunity to move on to something bigger...what if that doesn't work out, and I'm stuck at a fast food-esque drugstore chain for the rest of my life? Is ""not wanting to work retail"" alone a strong enough conviction to carry me all the way through post-grad?

A few months ago, my parents allowed me to reapply to UIUC's CS program after seeing how underwhelmed I was at pharmacy school. I got re-accepted, and all the preparations are in place for me to transfer...and now I'm not so sure if I want to go through with it. It's as if all my parents' warnings about the rigor, the tedium, and the cutthroat competition among all the international students at UIUC are finally starting to sink in, only a year too late. I'm beginning to doubt myself, even though only a year ago I would have leapt at the chance in a heartbeat. I do want to move forward with this decision, but fear is holding me back. I still believe I would be happier in CS--other than the fact that I may not finish with a degree, let alone a marketable GPA. I'm just utterly terrified of failure.

This decision has been tormenting me for the past two months. I've been losing sleep over it out of fear that I'll make the wrong choice and end up ruining the rest of my life. At the same time, I just want to put an end to this. The fact that I haven't been able to make up my mind by now makes me wonder whether CS was really meant for me in the first place. I'm looking for motivation, anecdotes, inspirational quotes, or just plain rational advice, even if you would actually advise me to stay where I am in pharmacy. Anything. I'm so torn between these two majors that I'm about ready to leave my fate up to the flip of a coin."
2cbhlu,2,2014-08-01,"After years of struggling and trying to find peace of mind, I'm at my breaking point. I finally lost.",depressedlife422,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2cbhlu/after_years_of_struggling_and_trying_to_find/,"Every year, it seems that my life gets worse. New problems, recurring depression, my demons that come back stronger and more immune to my futile attempts to be optimistic. I realized that I no longer have the emotional capacity and willpower to go through with what I am; Even hell seems a bit more comforting that where I am right now.

For a bit of context, I come from a poor family that's full of problems outside of finances. Father cheated on my mother and I found out at a young age, only he smirked in my face and wasn't apologetic. He proved to me how indifferent he was about me and my siblings by continuing t cheat on her for years. He has a massive ego, which prevents him from working hard at jobs and would rather invest in useless ideas and projects that only make life harder for my family. I attend a highly respected private university and find myself to be the rat amidst golden geese. I'm sick of having to tell lies, putting on fronts, putting myself through an identity crisis everyday just to protect myself from pity of others. I just want to be normal, all my friends around me live great lives with amazing families. Why is it so hard for me to just go to bed with peace of mind for one night's sleep?

My financial problems have continued to plague me throughout the years, and now I'm being sued for an accident as an uninsured driver because my dad lied to me saying I could drive just because he didn't want to pay the insurance. He says he's sorry for all the burdens he's placed on me and my family, but continues to take advantage of me. Just because I'm intelligent in an amazing program, he thinks I'm set for life, and continues to crush me with his own failures because ""He's going to be very successful, everyone around us thinks so."" For years, I wanted to achieve exactly this: succeed and wipe out my past of financial burdens and hardships, which came along with tons of emotional baggage and instability. I dreamt of making him beg at my feet, crushing him into a million pieces like he crushed me with his careless actions. I held on to the happiness of my sister, who is my life. I wanted to buy her things she's always wanted, always joked about how she would be able to live off of me for the rest of her life, the trips I would send her with my mother. Those same dreams now fail to give me hope and strength to move on. 

Not a day goes by in which I don't think about the high six-figures of debt I have, how I'm in the middle of a lawsuit at 21 and can't even afford a lawyer, how I might have to declare bankruptcy and ruin my credit and chances at prestigious financial jobs, which is what I've worked my ass of to achieve throughout college. I've lost great internship and job opportunities that my friends hated me for getting, but was never able to proceed with them because I don't even have a fucking car in the LA job market; I literally had hiring managers tell me that it was unfortunate that I had those types of situations chaining me down from flying. Pity, an old friend and all too familiar feeling. So much so that I look in the mirror and practice smiling in the mornings, I even practice laughing, because they both sound so awkward when I do both, like watching someone try to walk after being on a boat for months on end. 

Thinking about death makes me happier than thinking about my life in five years. My life is rotting away as the punching bag for my pathetic excuse of a father, and I'll never understand the happy moments of what is supposed to be the best time of my life. I won't know what it means to have fond college memories, supporting family, being able to see my friends at my leisure. I've turned down relationships with amazing, beautiful girls that I wanted more for their company and love than their bodies and sex because of how much baggage I carry. The idea of being a parent scares the fuck out of me because I don't know anything about a good supporting cast. The idea of having to even live that long is the scariest thing of all. 

I've tried hanging myself, the drug overdoses, I even had the police barge into my house when I tried to stab myself a few years ago. I thought I could become stronger, but I became more unstable. Can't afford to get help, can't see a psychologist or therapist, let alone meds, and there's nothing left for me to cling onto anymore. My life sounds like a melodramatic mess because it really is. I've tried and can try no more. I'm seriously contemplating killing myself again, and I might just go through with it this time."

Toakan here, with some tales that will probably leave you scratching your head and thinking 'What?!'

___
Some background for you, I am a recent IT Intern to a larger company, and I have the pleasure of working in their infrastructure side, so everything from reporting and monitoring to desktop support.

I was primarily involved in upgrading and rolling out W7 to all clients within a department and most of these stories are going to be from that little escapade.

___

It must have been tuesday... I think...

So I received an email from a supervisor in that department, apparently the network guys have updated the phone software, and now the clients cannot connect to the phones.

Sounds like a network config issue, but ok i'll come have a look.

Get down to the department, and go and see a friendly user who i've helped to troubleshoot before.

&gt; Friendly : Oh Hey Toakan! What are you down here for now?

&gt; Me : Apparently you can't connect to the phones properly?

&gt; Friendly : Oh yeah, we need this software active so that they can watch who is available on the TV (Yes, That TV...)

&gt; Me : Ok then, do you mind grabbing a coffee so I can troubleshoot on your machine?
 

So after a little bit of prodding I found that the software thinks the phone is on a different subnet. Nothing I can do about that, so i sign into OWA and throw an email accross to networks.

Thinking that i'm done, I get up, say thanks to Friendly and head on out.


Only to be grabbed by (Sup)...

&gt; (Sup) : Hey, can you look these machines? Since the phone's stopped working we moved people around so they could get on boxes that did work...

&gt; Me : You moved people around to get them on machines that did work?

&gt; (Sup) : Well, yes. Just come and have a look please, the internet has stopped working on them.

So i follow behind (Sup), wondering how they managed to get the phones working when the network guys screwed up the config.

___
OMG NO.....
___

There, on the users desk, sat a brand new PC which had been disconnected and thrown to the side. I mean it must have been thrown, considering the front panel was hinged off, and the side panel was dented. By the looks of it, it wasn't going to start any time soon.

In it's place sat an old XP machine, which was scheduled to be wiped and rebuilt. 

&gt; Me : What did you do to this machine?!

&gt; (Sup) : Oh, well that one wasn't working so we replaced it with an old one till you could fix it. By the way, since your here....

&gt; Me : No sorry, you need to raise a ticket for that and the IT Manager needs to assign it to me before I even think of touching that.

&gt; (Sup) Ok i'll go do it now. Can you look at why the internet doesn't work?

I know why it doesn't work, these machines have been taken off the domain so they have no access through our VPN. But sure I will humor him, just so IT Manager can come down and see the damaged machine.

So i just sat there, opened command prompt and ran Tree a couple of times to make myself seem busy. The phones worked with this machine cause the config was still set to the old system, which the new one was based on. Weird but I guess it works.

Friendly comes over and tells me that Sup had Carpenter move the machine and replace it because he lost his temper.. Well that explains the damage I guess.

Oh! Here comes IT Manager! (ITM from now on)

&gt; ITM : Toakan, I just spoke with Sup and he said you won't fix his machine?

&gt; Me :  Well, not won't. More like I cannot fix it.

I pointed at the new machine.

&gt; Me : Can't really do much with this now...

&gt; ITM : WTF HAPPENED?

&gt; ITM : Sup, Get here now!

He actually shouted across the department, bearing in mind ITM is an older gentleman who is generally a nice guy. This startled a few people, including me.

&gt; Sup : What's wrong? Did you get the ticket I sent in?

&gt; ITM : Nevermind the ticket, what did you do to this machine? 

&gt; Sup :  Oh, well since the phones stopped working on it, we replaced it with an older one. Toakan have you fixed the internet yet?

&gt; Me : I can't fix it, it is no longer compatible with our network.

&gt; ITM : Toakan, grab the new machine and take it back to the lab, see if you can salvage anything. Sup, you and I are going to have a few words in the conference room..

Taking this as my cue, I gathered up the abused machine and took it back to our lab for surgery.

Sup followed ITM into the conference room and i'm pretty sure the entire 3 floors knew it.



Something about touching our equipment, Dismissal and criminal damages...

___

So yeah, more to come regarding this supervisor.

I think i'll keep this in chronological order, just to help with recall, and so you can see how this actually progressed.

Just another thing that later comes back to me...

2cc02p,159,2014-08-01,Helping the Elderly,UnderscoreRiot,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2cc02p/helping_the_elderly/,"Hi TFTS, long ^time ^^something, ^^^first ^^^^time ^^^^^whatever, ^^^^^etc.

I want to preface this by mentioning that i'm 17 and I graduated high school a couple months ago, and i'm currently working an internship in internal IT at a software company of about 300 people, but that's somewhat irrelevant.  

Now, my parents are very social people and therefore a lot of people in our neighborhood like to call them about their computer problems since they all know about my internship.  I usually don't mind helping since nearly everyone pays me, and that attitude leads to some situations like the one below.

So, yesterday around 5 pm, after a hard grueling day of doing intern things I got home, and before I could take my shoes off my dad tells me that our elderly neighbor across the street called and said her internet wasn't working.  Since dinner wasn't yet ready, I decide to go across the street to try and help her.  

I knock on the door, and the following conversation happens:

&gt;Me: Hi, Ms. Neighbor, I was told your internet wasn't working

&gt;Neighbor:  Yes, well I have a couple other things I want you to do first, if that's okay

F**k.

&gt;Me: Sure thing, what do you need?

&gt; Neighbor: Well, I got a new TV and now my remote doesn't work, could you do that first?

I grudgingly agree, and she leads me to her living room.  She had gotten a new 22' flatscreen TV, it was plugged in and sitting on the floor in front of a CRT of the same size.

&gt;Neighbor: Oh, I hate to ask you this, but could you move this old box to the porch?

*F*\*\**K.*

&gt;Me: Of Course.

I proceed to spend five minutes very carefully carrying this 15 year old TV through her house, trying my hardest not to knock anything over.  I eventually get it out the front door, and I move her (thankfully, very light) new TV onto the entertainment center, then spend 15 minutes looking up a manual for her universal remote, and the same amount of time programming it.

The next problem she had was that the port for her internet cord*(sic)* was broken.  It was some odd, sideways RJ-45 port attached to the wall and it looked like someone had dropped a cinder-block on it.  Luckily, all of the wires inside it were intact, and with some force the plastic box snapped back together with a resounding click.

Her final problem was that her internet wouldn't work.  When I asked her to elaborate, she said she couldn't connect to some website on her **laptop** and it was giving her a server error (she actually wrote the error down on a sticky note, to my surprise).  Problem is, she couldn't find her laptop, and we wasted 10 minutes looking for it.

&gt;Neighbor: Oh, well this is embarrassing.  How about you go on home and i'll call your dad when I find it?

I was hungry, and I could hear the enchiladas calling my name.

On the way out the door, she looks at her **iPad** and picks it up.

&gt;Neighbor: Oh, here it is

&gt;Me: That's.... okay, what was the issue again?

&gt;Neighbor: This is the error it's giving me

She hands me her iPad with safari open, and lo and behold, the same error she had written down was on screen.  I made sure she was connected to her wifi, verified she could connect to the internet by opening the app store and going to a few different websites, everything worked.  I went back to the tab with the error and refreshed a few times, nothing.  Same error, but something catches my eye.  The URL she has typed in is ""capitainbobsseafood.com/dailylunchspecial"" (name slightly changed since the actual restaurant is in my area).

I decide to pull out my phone and go to the website, nothing happens.  Confused, I google the restaurant's name only to find out that **they don't have a website**. 

&gt;Me: Where did you originally see this website name?

&gt;Neighbor: I didn't see it anywhere, I just wanted to look at their lunch menu.  This is making me mad, I was on the phone with $ISP for hours last night because I can't see their menu.

Hours.  That poor, poor rep.  I didn't know whether I should laugh or feel bad for her, but after I told her that they don't have a website I had to explain to her that not everyone has a website, since they're expensive to maintain and yadda yadda so on and so forth.  After being there just over an hour, she thanked me for my help and wrote me a check for $50.

&gt;Me: Ms. Neighbor, you know I can't take this much

&gt;Neighbor: Well, think of it as a graduation present.

I realize this is something you can't argue about with old people, so I decided to go home before she came up with something else for me to do.  I left feeling bad for her, but there was a good 10 minutes there where I had to try my hardest not to laugh.

**TL;DR**:  A confused old woman doesn't understand how websites work, I managed to feel sympathy for tier 1 ISP support, recieved $50.

2cc85n,9,2014-08-01,It's only been 6 weeks and I'm already so discouraged...,Jumpyginger,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2cc85n/its_only_been_6_weeks_and_im_already_so/,"So I started job searching at the end of June, having finished college and just gotten back from my honeymoon.  I'm in NYC and have a B.S. in psychology.  I'm looking for research jobs, mostly at hospitals.  I did a summer internship that included some research experience but it's very limited.  I've applied to upwards of 30 ""research assistant"" positions and haven't heard back a thing.  Having looked at the postings on linkedin, they are getting more than 20 applicants for each one.  My resume is as good as it's going to get, and I've been customizing cover letters, but I feel like my biggest weakness is a lack of experience.  None of my previous jobs have anything to do with one another, and they don't point towards research.  Ironically enough I've gone into all my jobs with zero experience, and have always exceeded expectations in terms of how quickly I learn and how much effort I put in.  I just need to get my foot in the door somewhere, anywhere, but I don't know how to do it.  If they're getting 20 applicants per listing, I'm never going to be in that top 5 of people that actually get interviews; I just don't have the experience to put me at the front of the pack.  I'm trying to network as best I can but haven't had much luck.  My favorite college professor is trying to keep an eye out for me but I understand that he's kind of struggling to find decent full time work himself.  My aunt gave me the email of someone in the field who never responded to me.  My friend has an aunt that works in research at a hospital, so I'm hoping that one pans out.  I know it's a numbers game and I just have to keep putting my resume out there but damn I never thought job hunting with a degree would suck so much.  I've considered going back to school for a masters or phd but it seems silly to spend the money on another degree that won't guarantee a paycheck.  In a few months my husband and I will be out of wedding money and I'll have no choice but to go back to waiting tables, which is not what I went to school for.   Ugh, rant over."
2ccc65,1167,2014-08-01,East and west are not the same as left and right...,Rayne37,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ccc65/east_and_west_are_not_the_same_as_left_and_right/,"So this is a story from last year, when I had just started to intern at an IT company. It's also my first submission here, so pardon if its nothing fancy.

Anyways, I worked the first three months at this company as part of HelpDesk, and during that time my days were filled with replacing printer toner. Every person had a printer at their cubicle, and HelpDesk was tasked with replacing toner, even if users knew how to do it. This generally meant if we didn't respond quickly people got upset pretty fast. After all, they could do it themselves if the toner wasn't locked in a cage in our wing of the building. 

Since replacing toner was my main task, I was good about getting to it quickly. Two weeks into the job, no complaints. To help me find everybody I had an excel spreadsheet on my computer showing the layout of cubicles and employee names. However, it is known to be a little inaccurate, due to high turn over. 

One day a man requests a toner replacement, and tells me he is in West wing of the building. I check the map and it shows he's near my cube. I grab the toner, and head off to find him.

Nope, nowhere to be found... I check the map again, start to ask around. Nothing. I head to the east wing, wander around some more with toner box in hand. Probably fifteen minutes after he's submitted the ticket he flags me down. The name on his cubicle....""Clark Kent"". I'd already walked by him twice without him saying a word to me.

Patience was not his forte. After he scolds me for a few minutes I ask about the name tag, explaining that was why I took a while to find him. Apparently this was a joke with his coworkers, his cubicle name tag changing weekly. He hadn't mentioned it in his ticket and he didn't see why that was a problem that his real name was nowhere to be seen on his desk.  

He then pointed out that he told me in the ticket which wing he was located in, and that he should have been easy to find based off that alone. 
 
&gt;Me: You told me west, this is the east wing. 

&gt;Guy: Yea, but its the west when you're facing it from the outside.

.... Trying to hide my confusion I take a moment before asking. 

&gt;Me: You mean left?

&gt;Guy: No I mean west. From my perspective its the west wing so I wasn't wrong.

He's dead serious.

At this point he started to get pretty angry with me. I realized it really wasn't worth my time or energy to correct him and left.

So yea, apparently east and west change depending which direction you're facing. Who knew? "

But, the phone box didn't like that, and needed a reboot. Also, the main finance application needed a restart because it had no listed printers anymore. I got the following ticket.
&gt; Mr. Annoyance here. The network is down, the printers are down and the phones are down. fix it.  

My first thought was, of course, how he submitted a ticket while the network was down. that takes creativity. 

I knew the phones were still down and being rebooted, so I e-mailed him, telling him to restart the application. I get an e-mail back. 

&gt; The phones are down.  
kind regards,  
Mr. Annoyance

I answer by telling the user we're working on it, his phone has to be up in a minute. 
and of course, within a minute the phones came back up.  
About five minutes later, I get another e-mail. 

&gt;The damn phones are still down, I want it fixed, i need to call people!  
Kind regards,  
Mr. Annoyance

I take a look in the phones list, and I see his phone is activated, up and running. it has a shiny new IP adress and shows up as ""online"" in the management application. I dial his phone. 

&gt;Mr. A:  Mr. Annoyance, hello?

&gt;Me: Hello Sir, It's DoubleUsee from the IT department. I- ...

&gt;Mr. A: Ah, I was about to mail you again. The damn phones are still down, and I need to call ImportantOrganisation *right now*!

&gt;Me: That's what I'm *calling* about sir. The phones are back up! 

I expected him to catch the joke. but nope. 

&gt;Mr. A: No, they are not damnit, Mrs. Dumbs tried just now, she's not having any signal! 

&gt;Me: Sir, I guarantee you, the phones are up. I swear it, your phone works great.

&gt;Mr. A: Bullshit. Why don't you come over here and see for yourself instead of just claiming stuff without checking?

&gt;Me: Well, I can prove you your phone is working...

&gt;Mr. A: How?

&gt;Me: As I am calling you over the phone you claim is not working. 

(note that I had checked if we could call external phones)

&gt;Mr. A: Well... uh... shit. but...  Mrs. Dumbs her phone isn't working!

&gt;Me: My list says she's not logged into her computer. One needs to be logged into the computer in order for the phone to log in.

&gt;Mr. A: What is that for shitty system? why don't you go fix that? *klick * 

And for some reason that guy has a manager position. 

Tl;dr: I phoned a guy to say his phone was working. he didn't believe me. "

2cdkyx,3,2014-08-01,How can I feel more positive about my career?,Sexycornwitch,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2cdkyx/how_can_i_feel_more_positive_about_my_career/,"Hi Reddit, I really need some help. 

I'm 30, F, I currently work in tech support and want to move into QA testing. This isn't a question about that job progression, but more about my mental state. 

The company I work for hired me in and then after a few months, under went a re-organization that took away a lot of my benefits, opportunities within the company and increased the amount of stress at work drastically. Before this happened, I really liked the job. 

Leading up to this job, i've bounced from career to career. I worked in the fashion industry for a while but then changed careers because I wasn't happy with the people in the industry and was generally not a good fit personality wise for the industry. I spent a lot of time and money on school and in internships to get into that line of work, and the fact that I had put so much work into it, had the skills to acomplish the job I was doing but was miserable all the time because of the industry was hard, but I ended up going into a different career. 

Went back to school, spent two years at the top of my class in a different industry. I got a really good in to the job that I wanted, only to be laid off a few days after being hired due to budget cuts. During the time I was looking for work in that second industry, I had a lot of very negative expiriences and realized the pay scale i was looking at in that industry would not be able to cover my expenses. 

Now, I'm 30 and I like being in the tech industry a lot. I've done a lot of freelance manual QA and am working on my skills in that industry to get a better job. 

But I feel so disheartened about my failures. I have failed so many times and I have not succeeded very often. Most of the times that I've worked really hard at something, it's been destroyed due to things that are really outside of my control, and it's getting harder and harder to pick myself back up again. 

I'm starting to have more fits of depression, because I feel like i am avearge and the best I can ever hope for is average. I just seriously worry that there just is no opportunity out there that I can achieve that will be an improvement. I know that's not accurate, but at this point, I'm a fairly logical person and I keep seeing all my past failures as evidence that there's no hope for my career in the future. 

How can I get past this so that I can move forward and do what I want to do? At this point, I'm with a great guy that I'm crazy about, and my depression and hopelessness at my career situation is pushing him away and hurting him. I don't really have access to a therapist because it's not covered by my health care plan and I don't have the money to go to one on my own. I don't want my relationship to end because i feel so hopeless about my career situation. Please help? "

However, I accepted a job at an agency anyway because I wasn't having much luck getting another type of job due to being fresh out of school with limited experience outside PR internships and no ""hard"" skills. 

In addition, my commute to work is a good 70-80 minutes in the morning, and 60-75 minutes in the afternoon. I take the train, but it's during rush hour to and from a major city, so it is extremely crowded and not the most pleasant. I also have to ensure that I leave early enough in the morning in order to get parking at the train station. While the job itself is bearable, the commute is starting to wear me out. 

I knew it was a long commute going into it, but being new to the area and the working world, I had no idea what it would really be like. I used to be able to occasionally work from home (1-2 times a month), and leave work slightly earlier (like at 5 instead of 6) if I got into the office early, but the agency I'm at is expanding and becoming stricter about everyone being in the office at the same times, so there is not as much flexibility as there was when I first started. 

I was originally planning to try to stick this out for a year, but due to these recent changes, I'm tempted to start applying for new jobs in different fields now, especially since I've had the chance to develop some general admin skills that can be applicable to a variety of different positions. 

In addition, I will likely be moving within the next six months, and that will make my commute 20+ minutes longer. Moving closer to my current job is not an option due to rent prices increasing exponentially the closer you get to the city. I also wouldn't really care to live in the city even if I could afford it, definitely prefer the suburbs, which is where I plan to look for a new job.

So my question is: How long should one ideally stay at a first job out of college? And is the commute an acceptable reason to start looking for a new job?"
2cfcua,3,2014-08-02,Feeling very lost as to where I should go after graduating with no internship.,Dictator_Rich,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cfcua/feeling_very_lost_as_to_where_i_should_go_after/,"This is at least the third topic I have made on here within the last year, so I apologize for that. Anyway, I graduated with a BS in Computer Programming/Information Technology a little more than a year ago with an overall 3.2 GPA (closer to 3.7 if you only count the computer related classes. I hated accounting and spanish lol). I made the critical mistake of not taking an internship during college, so here I am now. 


Now, I'll be honest, while I have been looking at jobs through sites such as monster.com, craigslist, dice.com, etc, I have not applied for any of them. The reasoning behind that is that a lot of the entry level jobs still require about a year of experience, which I have none of, outside of school and personal projects. Also, I've had the misfortune of not having my drivers license, which greatly holds me back. Completely my fault, I waited much longer to get my license than I should have, but I am finally taking my road test in two days, so hopefully this opens up some new doors. 


I have definitely been keeping myself busy in terms of coding and learning new concepts. Lately, I have been teaching myself android development with Java, and have been teaching myself some game programming in android. I made a few simple apps for android. I got some more in mind that I would like to do, and some game ideas as well. Also, while it's not quite programming, I have been brushing up on my web development skills, and taught myself Javascript (not sure if Javascript would be considered programming). I made a website for my friend's band which I am pretty proud of, and I am currently working on a portfolio website for myself. I've also been reading through ""Cracking the coding inteview"", which was actually recommended to me here. 


That's basically what I have been doing lately, but I am very confused as to what my next step should be. I was thinking about doing freelancing on sites like odesk and freelancer, but I'm not sure how much I trust those anymore. I have also been thinking about looking for an internship, but I hear that graduating from college over qualifies me for them. I feel like I am at a road block right now. 


What would be my best option at this point? Should I try applying for those internships anyway? If so, what is the best way to find one? Should I try free lancing? If so, are there better websites than odesk and freelancer? Should I try applying for entry level jobs, even if they require some experience? If so, are there better websites than monster, craigslist, and dice to be looking? Perhaps something else altogether? I would take pretty much anything that's related to programming.  I feel like if I don't start making some serious moves now, I'll never get a programming job. Please help!

2cfdjc,3,2014-08-02,Should I try and take a job I am severely under-qualified for?,LeChuck999,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2cfdjc/should_i_try_and_take_a_job_i_am_severely/,"I've been working as an intern at an Institute of Technology for the past 7 months. I've been doing alot of basic work with wordpress and my time is almost up.

However, the senior in web development and digital marketing is leaving in September and my superioers figured I should try out for his position. They tell me I will have a good chance because of my work with the institute so far, however they are not very tech savy so probably don't know what is involved.

I think the man who is leaving knows how under qualified I am  but wants to leave without any hassle so agrees to breifing me at what he does at the job. 

Problem is, he uses PHP, FTP and other things I have no clue about! I'm afraid if I do somehow land this job, I will be useless and a burden on the institute. 

I suffer from severe anxiety, so I don't know how much of this is in my head. I can't think of anything else but how much of a joke I will look if I get this job. I also feel guilty because i know there are so many people out there, way for qualified then me who would love this job! 

Everyones telling me I should go for it, that I have nothing to lose! My biggest fear, is if I get the job I will be a burden and a laughing stock because I will be so incompitent! :(

Has anyone ever been in a position like this before? How did it work out?

Edit: I want to say a massive thank you to all the comments so far. You guys are really putting things into perspective and it is a bigger help then you might think. Its hard to talk about this stuff irl and you guys are definatley taking some of the weight off my shoulders!"
2cg1rd,1,2014-08-02,CS Minors and working in the field,DankNugsBro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cg1rd/cs_minors_and_working_in_the_field/,"Hey Everyone,

Sorry my situation is a little difficult to explain and was hoping I could get insight from some of you working in the field. My story begins with the passing of my father during the first semester of my undergrad. I ended up failing/dropping all of my classes for the next few semesters and had no direction as far as a major and was just taking random GE classes.

After taking a few comp sci and web design courses I realized that this was the major for me and began taking classes towards declaring the major. In the recent months I have been speaking with advisor after advisor and worked my way up to the head of enrollment services and nobody will allow me to declare CS as my major. This is mainly because of the number of completed (useless) units that I already have and my sketchy transcript (dropped/failed classes).

My only option is to declare a major that requires very few units to graduate and add two CS minors. BA in American Studies :( with minor in Computer Science and minor in Web Technologies/Applications. I know this is going to put me at a major disadvantage trying to break into the field vs other applicants with a BS in CompSci.

I was hoping some of you could share what I should be doing during my last few semesters to help my chances. Internships? Community College courses?

Thank you!"
2cg5ri,12,2014-08-02,I want help but I have to ask for it and I can't speak to people?,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2cg5ri/i_want_help_but_i_have_to_ask_for_it_and_i_cant/,"Just a rant I guess, sorry..

I'm sure I have social anxiety, I've lost all my friends after secondary school and haven't been able to make any over my college course and university first year. Speaking to new people makes me very nervous and I know that I'll hate anything I say and that I will embarrass myself.

The anxiety I feel when I have to speak to people turns me into a personality-less, dull robot. My face tenses up, I struggle to take in what the person is saying and I can't wait to be alone again. And then I feel lonely and awful. I was given a dream internship which should have been an amazing experience but I was so awkward and uncomfortable I believed they thought I wasn't interested. It was simple things like leaving and having to say 'bye', I'd worry they wouldn't hear me/I'd distract them or other bad things so most days I'd wait until the room was empty which was rarely ever. I wished I could be myself around all of them as they were nice and welcoming, I know I seemed ungrateful, it really made me hate myself. I couldn't bring myself to email them back after they contacted me after it, I told my parents that I had done but I didn't and now I regret that so bad. In secondary school it was saying 'Yes' to the register, my one word for the day, (pretty much) and it had to sound normal, I'd clear my throat and listen very carefully to make sure I was definitely saying yes to my name. It made me worry more than it should have.

I tell my parents I have no friends and can't speak to people but they say oh it's going to get better. They brush it off and it hurts so much because I want to get help so I can live my life better. I always hoped that one of my teachers would have a word with me after recognising I had something wrong, just so I could get help, or even just so I can be labelled with the illness so people don't think I want to be alone.

When I get really upset which seems to be getting more often, I hurt myself by scratching my arms with something sharp or hitting my head and pulling my hair out. It's when I feel an intense hopelessness and sadness, causing some sort of pain softens it a bit. 

I try and force myself to interact with people and have good experiences, one nice person starting an interaction will make my day very positive but any bad experience seems to make staying alone feel safer. 
I want to get help but I can't talk to people. I can't get help and I feel hopeless, I will never be able to go and speak to someone about it.

I live in Canada and here some of our community colleges offer ""Applied Degrees"". These differ from a regular degree by being extremely hands on and not qualifying graduates for graduate school (which is not an issue as I don't have plans for graduate school). I am looking at this rather than a computer science degree because I'm not great at math, I can do it but I'm not great. I also am missing prerequisites to get into a comp sci degree and it would take another year or two to complete those.

2cgo45,2,2014-08-02,Clingy internet friend...,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2cgo45/clingy_internet_friend/,"I used to play an mmo a long time ago and was active on a fansite. Eventually I became a moderator and became friends with another staffer on the site. We're about the same age, and played some video games on steam together. He's nice enough, but he also has a lot of life problems, i.e. parents divorcing, hard time in school, medical issues, no friends, that sort of thing.

I live on the west coast and he lives on the east. We met when I was in about 8th grade, and now I'm a sophomore at University. I'm very busy with my classes, and this summer I am working 40 hours a week at an internship. We've known each other for so long, him and I are Facebook friends, and text on occasion. I see myself as his support, and that's fine. With all the issues he's had in his life, some stability with an internet friend is good for him. He can talk to me about his problems, and I can keep him sane. 

What I'm having issue with is the constant need for contact. Constantly. I've recently had to keep my steam account offline because he messages me all the time. He's told me I'm his best friend, which I find odd because we've never met. He claims he hates his life on the east coast, and wants to move to my area. I don't blame him because it's gorgeous here, but when he talks about this he talks about us hanging out and doing things. I've explained to him so many times, moving to the other side of the country is stupid, especially with his medical issues and lack of money. I'm in university, and in a few years, I'll be working. It's sad to say, but I have no desire to meet him in real life.

I understand he's having a difficult time, struggling with community college and his family, but I'm not sure I can do this for the rest of my life. I get texts while I'm at work, steam messages while I'm ingame, and facebook messages all the time. When I don't answer, whether it's me ignoring it or being afk, he gets anxious, so worried that I'm ignoring him. Once I didn't talk to him for about a week and I got a 3 paragraph message about how worried he was that I was ignoring him, maybe he was being annoying. He often messages me the moment I log on to steam (which autologs when I turn on my computer).

With all his difficulties, I am really worried that the moment I am gone, he won't have anything. Seriously. I don't think he would commit suicide, but you never know. Side question: How do I call 911 for someone on the other side of the USA? I want to be prepared if I ever need to.


I feel as though I have a disabled brother, who needs constant care and attention, no matter what. I need to break free from the internet and communication if I need to, and live my life without constant worry about how the internet friend is. I want to continue to help him, but how do I do this while living my own life and without causing him to rely upon me further?"
2chfv3,1,2014-08-03,Considering moving outside of the US,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2chfv3/considering_moving_outside_of_the_us/,"I'm 20, going to college for systems administration (though I just got done with the prereqs so I'm not that far in yet), and currently a student intern at a help desk.

I was talking with a coworker the other day and he got on a rant about how the system is broke, corporations are running everything, and the government is corrupt.  He is considering moving out of the country and it got me thinking.

Now this isn't something that I'm greatly considering, more of just an option I'd like to know more about.  I would want to move to Canada, Europe (UK or Germany), maybe Scandinavia.  My main concerns are:

1.  Is life really any better in other countries?

2.  Is there as big of a demand for computer related jobs as there is here?  

3.  Would my college degree and interning experience from America do me any good in another country?"

After doing research on mark zuckerbergs story on building Facebook in his dorm I was really inspired to learn to do what he could. After watching the social network I was astonished and confused at how he could code a website and how he could use command lines on websites to get all the photos on the website at once. (If you've seen it you'll know what I mean).

This all even pushed my desire to learn to do this stuff even more, the only problem is, I can't find a place where to start. Being 15 I can't do any courses or classes that can help me so I decided to ask good ole reddit. As cheesy and corny as this is gonna sound.. My dreams to work at the Facebook Offices in my city (Sydney AUS) and Ofcourse when I tell my parents this they think it's far fetched and highly improbable.

So that's about it, Anythink you guys could share like showing me a place to start, how to score a job at Facebook and also how I could get a internship. Thanks guys, this is all very unrealistic but I'm really confident I could do this.

2cibmc,472,2014-08-03,I just got fired from my programming internship.,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2cibmc/i_just_got_fired_from_my_programming_internship/,"Yesterday I was fired from my programming internship and I believe the way I was terminated was wrong. My now-former co-workers also believe the way I went out was messed up. However, they're also my friends so of course they'll console me. I wanted to know the reddit community's opinion on the matter.

First let me tell you about the company I worked for:

I was hired at an very small company for a programming internship. As a matter of fact, I was the first employee at this company. The business is run by a married couple and I worked out of their house. When they interviewed me they did not originally let me know that I was going to be working out of their house. They only told me that they had ""a location close by."" I only learned that I'd be working at their house when they gave me the address before my first day.

It was weird working at their house at first, but I got used to it. The product we worked on was an iPad app. It was written in Objective-C. The product became more successful and eventually they came to hire 3 more interns, but still worked out of the married couple's home.

This is when things started things used to go down hill with the company. They started to pay us late pay check. We also started to get treated badly. The wife would yell at us all the time for any little thing. If were stuck on a bug and asked her for help, she would get angry that we couldn't solve it. She would show her anger by yelling, sighing very loudly, and slamming things around. There wasn't one day which she wasn't yelling.

It came to a point where we were scared to ask her for any help because we didn't want to get yelled at. However that backfired all the time because she got mad that we were struggling with a problem instead of asking her. Also, they expected us to stay later than we were scheduled all the time. I believe this is a side effect of working at their house. The couple rarely left the house. They pretty much worked on the product all day and I believe they expected us to do the same. 

I recall one time when we had a demo that was scheduled for the next day. There were bugs in the program so we were working past our scheduled time. We actually stayed an extra 2 hours and 45 minutes. At that point I believe we were working for about 10.5 hours with only a 15 minute lunch break. I was extremely hungry so I told them I had to go. They responded sarcastically, ""it's not your problem, huh?""

I always felt like they cared more about the product than us, the interns. I recall another time when we had a demo scheduled for the next day. It seemed like it was to be another long day. When I went to take a lunch break, the husband said, ""lunch break?"" as if I wasn't supposed to be taking a lunch break because I had to work hard on the demo.

I should also mentioned this was a paid internship. Being that it was such a small company, we were asked to keep track of our hours on excel and email them the hours at the end of each week. One day the husband came up to me and told me they were no longer paying us for our lunch breaks. I had no problem with this because in my previous jobs we didn't get paid for lunch breaks. However, I found out that he did not tell any of the other interns about this new policy.

On the day I was fired I submitted my hours as usual. However, my bosses called me and questioned the hours I submitted. They asked me why I did not account for the times I came late to work. I carpooled with one of the other interns and sometimes came late about 5-10 minutes late. I never factored in the times I was late because I thought they did not care about those 10 minutes. But I told them that it was fair that I should factor in my late time. I resubmitted my hours to them.

However, I also told my bosses that they should also keep track of the hours we worked themselves. I didn't feel it was right for them to say to question me about the times I came late if they actually had no record of this. They got angry and said they didn't need to keep track of our hours and had no trouble with the other interns on this issue. But I told them I did not mean to argue and it was only a suggestion. They said ok and accepted my hours.

I was later called and told that the the development of the iPad product was slowing down and that I should look for other opportunities. What do you guys think about the way I was fired? Also I know there are some missing details and holes in my story so feel free to ask me any questions.

**TLDR:**
I worked for a pretty shady company led by a husband and wife. The wife yelled all the time and showed no respect for us interns. There were also other issues that bothered us. I spoke up on one issue was fired that same day.

[EDIT]
I also forgot to mention that they were taking prescription drugs for depression and ADHD. They even offered some of us the ADHD drug, I believe it's called adorall, in their attempt to get us to concentrate. None of us took it of course."
2citbr,1,2014-08-03,"Thinking about moving to Germany/Europe, nervous about ditching life at home. Would like some advice.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2citbr/thinking_about_moving_to_germanyeurope_nervous/,"My life has undergone many changes recently, and a lot of my obligations have been removed. I broke up with my girlfriend, am moving out of my apartment, and my job is outsourcing so I'm on about a 4-month countdown (or less) until that is done. I live in a large city and can remedy all of those things pretty easily, especially considering that my company is more than willing to help me relocate into a different department. 

That being said, I have gotten the feeling that I really should be considering a move overseas. I have been to most European countries and would pretty much consider moving to any of them. I'm giving to preference to Germany because I am currently studying German. I do have some friends and family in some countries (Netherlands, Italy, and England). I also will be traveling to Germany for the upcoming Oktoberfest for 11 days, so that should be a good litmus test to see if I even enjoy it. 

When I talk to my friends about this, the support is overwhelmingly positive, and most of them have experience living in Europe for a number of years as well. ""Just shut up and do it"" is the most commonly dispensed advice. In fact, I haven't heard any advice telling me that I should not be doing it.

My hang up is that I don't want to consider this a little *Eat, Pray, Love*-style go-find-yourself-in-Europe-quest; I am genuinely interested in making a permanent move. Because of that, there are a few things that are concerning to me:

1. I currently do audio production semi-professionally--as it is a career aspiration for me--but I would have to end a lot of the business I have going on here and start fresh. That includes a great internship at a recording studio, which has been a great opportunity so far.

2. It seems that it is almost impossible to get a working visa unless I have a company sponsoring me, which I don't. I know it is possible to look at an extended visa for 6 months or so, but that's not really in the spirit of what I'm looking for. My mission would be to buy a one-way ticket, and find work and start life anew. But without that visa, I'm not sure how that would be possible.

3. Kind of a small thing, but I do have a car. It's a good enough car where I would not like to sell it, and should not do so for personal reasons, but I just wouldn't be sure what to do with it. Seeing as how it's incredibly fucking expensive to ship it, my only option would be to either put it in storage or loan it out for free to my sister and then ship it when I had the means to do so. Still though, I'm not sure how that would play out but it's not like I can do nothing with it. 

4. I don't have any money. I had been working part time and scraping by, but because of that I am flat fuckin' broke. As I stated above, it would not be difficult to move into another, better-paying and full-time position, but it is going to require some time to build up my savings. 

At this point, I'm really trying to see if this is a possibility at all. I'm definitely in the dark about how to make it happen logistically, as well. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated! Thanks!

2ciwgh,3,2014-08-03,Questions for contract engineers,ElHeffay,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2ciwgh/questions_for_contract_engineers/,"Hey there!  I'm considering becoming a contract engineer and I was hoping I could get some advice from other contract engineers (note: I'm not going to ask anyone on here to help me get a job with their company.  This isn't a networking attempt, I genuinely just have questions).

Before I ask my questions let me give some background info on my career since that's where all my concerns are stemming from.  I've been working as a mechanical engineer for the last three years designing orthopedic medical implants (plates, screws, etc. for fractured bones) as well as the surgical devices that are used to implant the plates.  This is the only engineering job I've had and is my only real source of experience since I was a bit lazy during college and didn't do internships/research.  This bit of info is important because I'm actually trying to branch out into other industries and the ""engineering"" that goes into orthopedic implants is very specific to this industry.  I'm worried that the longer I stay in this industry, the harder it will be to branch out.  I did well in college but I wasn't one of those genius kids who got straight A's without even studying.  You know the type.  I had to work really hard for my B's and C's, so I consider myself a very ""average"" engineer.  Not exceptional, but not bad at my job  So now onto my questions!

1.  Is it feasible for someone with my experience/skill level (as best as you can perceive through the info in this post) to get hired for contracted jobs?  Or are these mainly for engineers with many years of experience?

2.  Do companies hire contractors for ""lower-end"" engineering jobs like drafting and CAD work?  Ultimately I still want to do design work, but I figured the best way to get into a new industry is to just start from the bottom doing drafting and learn about the industry by proxy in the same way an intern does.  Has anyone had any success trying this?

3. I've been told about engineering contracting agencies such as Peak Technical and AeroTek.  Is it better to use an agency or is it possible to find contracts on my own?  Are there any real advantages/disadvantages I should know about?

I realize that these are all questions I could ask a recruiter (and I plan on it), but I've always felt the anonymity and frankness of reddit is a great source of candid information that I might not always get from talking to someone in a ""professional"" environment.  I also realize that the answers to my questions are going vary greatly from person to person, job to job, etc...  I'm mainly just looking for others to share their experiences.  Thanks!"
2cj344,3,2014-08-03,CS or Information Systems degree for someone bad with math,Endorks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cj344/cs_or_information_systems_degree_for_someone_bad/,"I'm 24 and heading back to school soon.
 I've picked a school on the other side of my state that offers both CIS and CS. I know I should go CS but the advanced mathematics it requires makes me nervous. 
 I was a high school dropout after my freshman year and managed to do very well so far but I'm guessing 4 year uni is harder than community college. I didn't take many math classes in cc so I would estimate my math skills to be around Algebra II. Would CS be beyond my capacity?
I just don't want to take an extra year or so to complete the degree like I read about a lot of people doing. Which is why I was leaning CIS, trying to get internships between semesters, and then possibly attending a programming boot camp once done with school.
I know CS tends to frown upon CIS degrees but I don't really give a frack about elitist attitude as long as I can land a job after school.

 The end result I would like to achieve is developing games (original, I know) but really I'd be extremely happy entering any job that starts at about 30k which is how much in loans I'll be having to take out assuming I don't get any scholarships. 
 
So what should I consider?

Lastly, 
I know males greatly outnumber females in these courses; will that make it any harder for me to make friends studying for the same thing?

2cj6ij,1,2014-08-03,seeking advice on long term strategy to break into AM,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2cj6ij/seeking_advice_on_long_term_strategy_to_break/,"Im a 24 year old guy who had no idea what I wanted to do with my life until late into undergrad when I started taking my finance major coursework. Since then, I fell in love with the industry. Ive been enthralled by the unmatched combination of energy, passion, and analytics. I spent the last year of my time in school and following year speaking with people in the industry and trying to leverage my past experience to edge into an entry level AM role but I am hitting a point where I would like some unbiased advice. I am focusing on AM because I believe it plays to my strengths. I am open to other suggestions.
    
    
&gt;My background: No-name state school with ~3.5 gpa degree in business admin with a concentration in finance. Had an amazing technology job at university and did not try to find an internship which has proven to be a mistake. Strong extracurriculars otherwise. 

&gt;I passed the CFA L1 a month after graduation. Ended up at a major consulting firm as an analyst working in the mortgage industry. The firm was anticipating growth in the sector but interest rates said otherwise and I was laid off in a little under a year. Im now working as a BA at a tech firm in the healthcare industry in a highly technical role (very proficient with SQL/Excel, some VBA exp). I basically spend my day problem solving and love it. Unfortunately, the role will disappear over the next year and I do not have a great interest in a less technical BA role.

&gt;The two primary weaknesses that I face are my no name school and my interview game. Ive done plenty of practice and real interviews but something about the process psychs me out. I have no problem with real pressure at work. The other day I successfully pitched an idea to our executives internally. I do believe that this will be less of a problem in the future as my experience grows.
    
    
I am seeking advice on which roles I should be looking for and how I should be spending my time outside of work to prepare myself. My current thought is to stay in healthcare/tech and develop that specialized industry knowledge. I believe I can use my SQL knowledge to immediately meet that goal but I am afraid I would lock myself into a career in databases, which I am not interested in. The other option I am considering is going straight back to school but I do not have the experience/undergrad to get into a top program. Since I would primarily be seeking a brand name and the associated network, I am having trouble justifying this direction.

If you were in my shoes, how would you be spending your time to make a move over the next year? Thank you for taking the time to read through this entire post."

2cjfjr,1,2014-08-03,TIFU by being a socially and romantically inept moron,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2cjfjr/tifu_by_being_a_socially_and_romantically_inept/,"This is a pretty long post, so bear with me while I vent.

I feel the need to start this thread off by stating that I haven't had sex in two years. There have been a few encounters with different women during that time, but no actual sex since the end of my last official relationship. I should also add that I went from a short, skinny and pretty damn awkward guy to a much more muscular--albeit still short--and better looking guy within the course of a year that a lot of women now find attractive. However, my ability to read social ques--i.e. women's signals--has not developed nearly as well as my muscularity and I'm still extremely stupid when it comes to picking up on obvious body language and gestures. I'm far from asexual and I actually have a pretty strong sex drive, especially when in relationships. That sex drive is easily balanced out by the fact that I'm pretty strongly introverted and just really fucking dumb when dealing with anything involving women. With that being said, that still doesn't excuse the brilliantly dumb actions that I've made in these last few days. 

In about a month, I'll be beginning a graduate degree program at a very prestigious school. I was also given a chance to do a paid internship this summer in the field which I'll be working in after I earn my degree. Everything was great with the program and I've worked with a lot of amazing people who are currently working on their degrees while employed there for the summer. 

There were a few cute women out of the dozen or so summer employees, but almost all of them were either in a very serious relationship or already married. I think the one exception to this was actually the best looking one, fortunately. For the sake of anonymity, we'll call her Michelle. Upon first meeting the rest of the crew, I was introduced to Michelle by a co-worker who had already met her. Prior to shaking her hand, I noticed that she gave me a strong look up and down while grinning. I noticed this happened to me with a few other female employees at this business and I didn't think much of it at the time (stupid, I know.)

Overtime, Michelle and I didn't have all too much interaction with one another outside of the mandatory social events that we were required to attend once a week, all of which were actually pretty fun. I noticed that Michelle became a bit more flirty at some of these events, ranging from asking for contact information (gmail address for the purposes of chatting) to asking for a kiss on the cheek before leaving from one of the final events. Alcohol flowed pretty freely at the events and I just chalked it all up to the significant amount of drinking that some of us were doing. Overall, Michelle seemed a bit flirty with everyone, so I guess it wasn't too off for me to think that was just her nature, especially when she was drinking.

There was an employee that everyone knew she was interested in since she always seemed to gravitate towards him in the office or at the events. We'll call him John. At one point, Michelle even admitted to a few of our co-workers that she had a huge crush on John. The recruiter (who was actually really cool and more like a fun co-worker than our boss) noticed this and mentioned it to me since we all picked up on the vibe. It wasn't a huge issue, it was just sort of like we all wished she would just tone it down a little since it just looked unprofessional. 

So let's fast-forward to the last event of the summer that took place last week. We all went out for a while, with both summer employees and regular employees all invited. Eventually, we all end up at a bar and the drinking from earlier in the night continues. 

At one point, I was sitting on a couch, trying to organize a ride home (I lived pretty far out since I'm staying with family in the area for the summer.) Michelle comes up and a little dialogue ensues. She then takes a seat between me and John on the couch and starts rubbing my leg continuously over the course of a few minutes. My initial thought is to question exactly what's going on at that moment, but then she grabs my hand and starts caressing the back of it. Even given how stupid I am when it comes to picking up signals (which I'm sure she had figured out at that point), there was no way I could be oblivious any longer. 

I'd like to say that this story ends with us fucking like she undoubtedly wanted, but if you've gotten this far into this wall of text, you probably know this isn't going to end well. 

Instead of making a move on what was more than likely a sure thing, I sat and did nothing. I was a bit taken aback by the fact that Michelle seemed to be actively flirting with John and I concurrently, so I didn't even bother trying.

This is the part where it goes from missing out on a good opportunity to just being a despicable person...

In my drunken state, I'm pretty sure I told the recruiter--again, who for all intents and purposes was essentially our boss for the summer--about the incident. I'm not sure why I did it and it definitely wasn't out of spite, although I did feel pretty uncomfortable while in the situation, but I guess I just talk a lot to whomever while drunk. I'm seriously hoping the recruiter didn't speak to Michelle about it, but I'm sort of inclined to believe that she would have been obligated to say something. 

Upon leaving, I said bye to everyone and Michelle hugged me from the couch and kissed me on the neck, although I'm not sure if that was intentional or if she was aiming for the cheek but missed as I rose too quickly. We mentioned something about Gchatting sometime soon, but I sent her a message on Friday and today to no avail, leading me to believe that maybe her and the recruiter had a conference.

I spoke to the recruiter about the night the day after via text and no mention was made of the incident and it was a pretty funny, light-hearted conversation. Still, the fact that I got no answer from Michelle now is pretty damning considering that she responded pretty quickly to other messages in the past.

I feel like a horrible fucking human being. If there was a conversation about the incident with the recruiter, she'll have to deal with extra scrutiny when she comes back next year since she just accepted a position with the company. She'll also have a reputation for being the office flirt and I'll now have the reputation for being the office snitch when word gets around.  

I spent all weekend trying to figure out why the fuck I opened my mouth about any of this. I could have had a good thing going if I shut my mouth and stopped being a socially inept dumbass for a few minutes. Now I'm pretty sure that Michelle and probably a few other summer employees hate me.

TL;DR: Got hit on by a cute girl, possibly ruined her career and social relationships at the job because I'm an idiot."
2cjral,1,2014-08-03,"Need life advice in helping my wife, our future and career.",dragontamerV2,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2cjral/need_life_advice_in_helping_my_wife_our_future/,"**Context:**  
A bit of context before I describe the situation. Before marriage we had been together for 4 years, me living in Canada while she lived in Turkey. Our relationship is great, we talk things out, and we saw each other fairly often. I also came to Turkey on an exchange and stayed for 7 months with her. At this time we were university students, since July 2013 we both graduated from our respective unis.  
  
  
I left Turkey after I graduated to get a job, and a place to bring my then girlfriend. Before she could come to start the immigration process her mom gets diagnosed with breast cancer; this happened April 2014. After the diagnose the mom gets operated and starts chemotherapy. My then girlfriend and I had been talking and planning about getting married and decide to do it in June, just in case things get worse with her mom. I come for the wedding, things go well, no second thoughts on both ends, and we have a great night. At this point my mother in law has been doing chemo for close to 2 months and so far looks great.  
  
  
Month of July turns into the hardest month for my wife and mother in law. Half way through things slowly start to go south, mom ain't dying and doctors are confident but chemo is taking a toll on her. My father in law is a good for nothing and actually doesn't care about his wife's condition, my brother in law; who's 29, pretty chill, open minded, caring, tends to bitch now and then but still down to earth; suddenly decides not to care for his mom. He lives, an hour and a half away, on the autobahn it doesn't take long to go and come back. Work is actually paying for his rent, meals and gasoline; he's a civil engineer and he's well off compared to some of the other civil engineers.  
  
  
**Situation:**  
My wife is pretty much alone, taking care of her mom, the house, the shopping, and the dogs. Sadly she had to quit her job to take care of her mom. Financially they're okay so it's one less stress on their minds. When we talk, my wife is emotionally tired, lonely and not looking her best. I do the best I can to make her smile, preoccupy her, talk about her preparing for the GMAT, along with preparing to either go back to uni or go to med school. Again I do what I can and have told her many times that she needs financial assistance, to not hesitate to ask.  
  
  
With all this I'm considering to leave my job by September, go to Turkey, help my wife to take care of her mom (until January 2015 when they verify if the cancer is gone), and then once everything is solid, come back to Canada. My main fear are the repercussions from doing this; likely hood of getting another job, and if immigration Canada needs me to come in for an interview in regards to my wife's application. I've been working at my job for 8 months, sadly it's not permanent and they've hired me as a programmer/analyst intern, thought I don't do intern work, since their department doesn't have the budget. They have an office in Izmir and I've informed my supervisor of my situation and if it would be possible to get transferred to Izmir. Sadly it's not possible since I'm considered an intern.  
  
  
I've got another job with one of my profs as a research assistant in industrial robotics; it allows me to work from home and on my personal computer. My professor understands my situation and would likely let me work in Turkey but I haven't brought it up to him yet.  
  
  
Unfortunately I don't know the best course of action to take. My folks don't know and my mom and her family don't necessarily like my wife; since I didn't marry my Turkish childhood friend; so their advice won't be that useful. What's everyone's advice? Is their a good solution to this problem?  
  
  
**TL;DR** Mother in law has breast cancer, wife's family are dumping the problem on my wife and don't want anything to do with the mother. I'm considering to go to Turkey to help my wife. Is this the best course of action?"
2cju4g,626,2014-08-03,I worked in food production this summer. Until this morning.,lmMrMeeseeksLookAtMe,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2cju4g/i_worked_in_food_production_this_summer_until/,"I work in a canning plant, one of the largest in the world. It’s pretty much a 24/7 operation as a result. For this summer, I got an internship in the quality control lab running food safety checks around the production and warehouse areas. I’ve come across many weird things in my inspections: rats eating their own trapped dead, crack pipes and burnt roaches, and one time I even walked in on two warehouse employees fucking behind a row of pallets 35 feet high. 

None of these things could have prepared me for what happened yesterday and this morning.

The other night, there was a storm. A real nasty one. Gale force winds and torrential rains. Night shift lost power about halfway through, decided to send everyone home and close until morning. By the time I arrived for my 7 AM shift, there were cops, power plant workers, and emergency response vehicles surrounding the facility. People were standing around the outside break area, smoking their cigarettes while waiting for the go-ahead to return to work. I made my way through the crowd, approached the plant manager Frank, and asked him what was going on.

Apparently during the storm, the winds were too strong and felled a tree, that in turn knocked down the back wall of Warehouse #5. A solid 40-foot stretch of wall was destroyed, along with some of the ceiling and tons of canned food pallets. Frank told me that once we got the all-clear, him and I would need to talk a walk around the warehouse areas to take inventory of what we had lost. Since Warehouse #5 is fairly unused in the offseason except for empty can pallets and tow motor storage, work wasn’t cancelled for the day. Frank said in the meantime, I could organize the MSDS stickers for the various sanitation chemicals we kept in the front offices, which were still open.

After about an hour of writing and attaching warning stickers to barrels of chemicals, Frank came into the storage room and told me that they were ready for the inspection. We had to clear the other four warehouses before allowing the remaining employees access. The inspection started off as fairly routine in the production areas and Warehouse #1. An old water bottle here, some dirty gloves there; nothing out of the ordinary. 

Warehouse #2 is where things started to get weird.

If you have ever been to warehouse for canned products, you understand how creepy walking down the narrow rows between pallet stacks can be. Forty foot high stacks of silver cans towering over a 2.5 foot wide path that is nearly pitch black, even in full daylight. Not something for the claustrophobics out there. Anyway, we were about twenty feet down a path between two stacks when about five or six cans rained down from above. Only one made contact with Frank, but it was with the back of his head. Except for a sharp grunt, he was silenced immediately, no time to register what happened. In all the panic of the morning, Frank had forgotten his hard hat, and I never would have thought to question the manager. 

I rushed to Frank, blood welling from a wound on his head like a blooming rose. I could hear more cans were raining down in the main walkways and in the small rows between other stacks, but I ignored them. My fingers instinctively went to this neck, searching for a pulse, a beat, anything. After a few anxious seconds I found it. Faint, but there nonetheless. I grabbed Frank’s radio and began to call for help, but thankfully emergency workers had heard the cans drop and came to check things out. They helped carry Frank out from the pallets and into an ambulance waiting at the nearest exit. At the time, I could feel nothing but pity and guilt for Frank, but now, I see that he was the lucky one.

After taking some time to collect myself, I decided to continue on the inspection. Using Frank’s radio I called Carlos, the Quality Control Manager, and asked him to help me. He responded saying that he was already in Warehouse #3. As I walked there, I noticed cans from various pallets scattered across the floor. It wasn’t too hard to see that this was the case all the way to Warehouse #3. Whatever had knocked down those cans had come from there. *Just a family of squirrels chasing each other, or a scavenging raccoon.* 

As I entered Warehouse #3, I immediately saw a large gathering of workers and volunteers standing near a collapsed row of pallets. Since I was in quality control, I couldn’t help but wince; that was at least $30,000 worth of product gone. Getting closer, I could see the workers collectively muttering about something that had clearly disturbed  them. Carlos turned away from them, holding a gallon can in his hands, and ran towards me.

“What going on here?” I asked, “Did they hear about Frank? Did you guys find something?”

Carlos stared at me with wide eyes. “Yes,” he said silently, and held up the gallon can. 

It was a standard can of sloppy joe mix, but as I took it from his hands, I could see three large puncture marks that ripped into the other side of the can. *Claws.* I looked back at the row of destroyed pallets. The can I held in my hands was probably the most intact of them all, with most looking like crumpled balls of tinfoil, while the others were ripped open and drained of their contents.

“H-how?” I managed to stammer, unable to comprehend the curveball reality had just pitched me.

Whatever had opened these cans was huge, and strong. Very strong. I looked up at the tops of the surrounding pallet stacks, half-hoping and half-fearing what I would see. *Nothing.* I sighed momentary relief, and asked Carlos if he could escort me on Warehouses #3 and #4. He agreed, glad to get away from Warehouse #3. Besides more knocked down cans, and the destruction at the back of Warehouse #5, there wasn’t much else to see. If there was something inside, it seemingly only targeted the sloppy joe mix. Carlos and I helped the rest of the workers sort through the mess and asses product losses, which took up the rest of my shift. I went home last night exhausted, and passed out on my couch almost immediately.

I woke up at 4:37 AM this morning to the sound of my phone ringing. I let it ring, since I still had a few more hours until work. A little bit after the ringing stopped, I heard it vibrate again to signify that I had received a voicemail. Already awake, I decided to check it out, it was probably my mom having a nightmare about me or something. 

Instead, I had three missed calls and a voicemail from David, a QC night shift worker who I knew from high school. Given the previous day’s events, I figured some other shit had gone down. I couldn’t make out much at first, it sounded like a typical pocket dial, but I could make out distant sounds. Heavy breathing. Hurried footsteps. The crash of cans on concrete. A bellowing roar.

I’ve heard a lot of animals and weird noises before (Anyone ever heard the noise a fox makes? That song isn’t far from the truth) but that roar... that was one of the most hellish sounds I’ve ever heard in my life. I turned up the volume on my phone and held it close to my ear, waiting for another roar. It was silent for about ten seconds, and then I heard a person quietly sobbing:

“Ayuda por favor. Dios mio, ayuda.” 

This pleading continued for another few seconds before another roar appeared, nearly bursting my eardrum and causing me to drop the phone. Then the voicemail ended. I checked the clock again. 4:44 AM. I didn’t have to be to work for another two hours but David was obviously in trouble. I didn’t stop to think, I didn’t want to. I just wanted to save my friend. Racing there with my heart pounding in my ears, I had no idea what to expect. Nor could I have.

Flying into the closest parking space, I sprinted out of my car and through the front offices. If I had taken my time, I would’ve noticed that less than half of the night shift’s cars were remaining in the lot. All the rest had fled. When I entered the production area, I nearly fled myself. 

The power was completely out, with the exception of the security lights. Those were enough to see the shimmer of red across the floor. Pools of blood slowly flowed into drains that were clogged with chunks of flesh, bone, and hair. I dropped to my knees and covered my mouth, trying not to scream, and then vomited through my fingers. There was no running from the smell. My body was frozen in place. *Do I run? Do I scream? What do I do?* 

My panic was broken by a series of gunshots from Warehouse #1, followed by screams cut bloody short. I pissed myself a little in fear. *Guns don’t stop this thing. What does?* I heard the crash of cans as a pallet stack was knocked over. I scrambled to my feet and sprinted back to the storage room in the front offices. Once inside, I locked the doors and pulled my phone out. David didn’t answer. I can only assume that this beast got him in the voicemail I listened to. Out of anger, I chucked it against the wall and it shattered. A crazed sob escaped me. *Why did I do that? Why didn’t I run away? ... Am I going to die here?*  I broke down in tears.

A few minutes passed, and then I heard the rumble of trucks outside the facility and saw lights flash through the lone window. *Cars. People. Help.* I stood up and looked out the window to see not police or the emergency response vehicles from before, but instead military trucks. One of them was a large dark-green humvee with a man standing in the turret. I assume that it was his voice that came over their loudspeakers.

“Attention. This is the United States Military. We are currently establishing a quarantine zone over this facility and the surrounding area. If there is anyone still breathing in there, you will not be allowed to leave alive until we have completely confirmed the threat is removed.”

He continued to speak but I was too angry to listen or care. I paced the room impatiently, a dead man walking. If what I had seen of the beast’s strength was any indication, a nuclear strike would probably be the only way to successfully remove this threat. I collapsed against the wall, and buried my head in my hands. I remained in that position for a little while, listening to the hustle and bustle of the military outside the building. I kept running my options through my head. *Should I just kill myself? Should I risk leaving? Could I lure the beast to them?*

It wasn’t until I looked up and across the room that I got an idea worth having. Directly across from me were the barrels of sanitation chemicals I had labeled in detail yesterday morning. *How did I not think of that right away? I only wrote it about twenty times!*

We have two types of sanitary cleaner: U-MAC and T-CHLOR. One of the biggest hazards of U-MAC is that it is an oxidizing agent that can cause reactions in other chemicals. If U-MAC is mixed with any chemicals containing chlorine, it reacts to release Chlorine gas. Deadly chlorine gas. Well, it just so happens that the main ingredient in T-CHLOR is chlorine (who would’ve guessed) and I had about ten 55-gallon drums for each of the cleaners in the storage room.

I grabbed a crowbar, a couple of air masks used when cleaning old machine parts, and rolled three drums of each onto a service cart. Taking a deep breath, trying to steady my trembling legs, I unlocked the door, pushed the cart out into the main hallway, and started to push towards the swing doors to production.

Ramming through the doors, the drums almost spilled off the cart but luckily I kept balance and continued to speedily push towards the QC Lab in the middle of production. I started to whistle and shout to catch the beast’s attention, half expecting to be snatched up before I realized what happened. There was no immediate response. I shouted louder and started banging the crowbar against one of the drums. Still nothing.
The QC Lab is located in the middle of each production area, with two steel doors leading to each, and no windows. I opened the one of the doors and rolled the barrels off the cart and into the lab. The room was untouched. I tore my shirt off and stuffed it in the only drain. I put on three of the filter masks, and pried off the top of one of the T-CHLOR drums with the crowbar, and allowed the chemicals to spill onto the floor. *Where is it? Does it know I’m trying to trick it?* 

With no time to spare for negative thoughts, I opened the other two barrels of T-CHLOR and added them to the pool of chemicals already a few inches deep. As I finished dumping the last drum, I heard a large crash and a subsequent growl from outside the door I didn’t enter. *It’s here.* I got the U-MAC drums in place. I began emptying them into the pool, grabbed a few spoilage cans from the countertop, and opened the door.

A humanoid creature was perched on top of the production machinery, standing out in the dim glow of the security lights. It was a gaunt thing, with long, sinewy arms and legs. Pale, grey skin stretched too tight over varicose veins and rippled muscles. Its hands were more finger than palm, with black claws stretching several inches out from each. The claws dug into something resting out of the light to its left, and lifted it to its mouth, which looked like a shark’s. Rows of razor sharp yellow teeth pushing out and over one another dug into the object and tore away. Blood shone in air briefly as I made out the shape in its claws: a human leg. Nervously, I glanced upward from the leg. Its eyes met mine.

Adrenaline coursed through my body. I weakly chucked one of the spoilage cans at it, dropped the others, and dashed back into the lab. I heard it behind me moving as swift as shadows. The chlorine gas fumes were already thick in the air as the floor had turned into a caustic mess and spilled out into production. Behind me, the door didn’t have a chance to shut again. The beast held it open, and stared at me with black pits. My eyes burned from the fumes. My nose was beginning to sting. I screamed with ferocity and kicked one of the empty drums at it with all the energy I had left. 

It leapt at me with a matching screech, caught the drum in midair, and then crashed into the chemical pool below. The far door shut. I took my chance and quickly left through the door at my back, slamming it shut. My only hope was that the steel doors would hold. My eyes burned uncontrollably. I couldn’t breathe from the combination of fumes and multiple masks. I heard agonizing screams and yelps coming from behind the doors as my head began to spin. *I did it. I killed it.* Then all was black.

When I woke, I was in the back of an ambulance. There was a military officer and what I’m assuming was a CDC scientist. They talked quietly amongst themselves for a few minutes until they realized I was conscious. I was hooked up to respirators and ton of other equipment, but I managed to croak out a sentence. 

“Wh-what was it?”

The scientist looked at me with curious eyes. “We don’t know. We suspect it was something paranormal, but all we know is that it craved human flesh. Well that, and that you killed it.”

I guess the look I gave them said it all, because the officer gave me a shit-eating grin and said, “That’s right son. You killed it. Now get some rest before you play hero.”

I closed my eyes until I arrived at the hospital. When I woke in my bed, I skipped around the news searching for a report on the carnage, but there was none. I started to reflect on all the events that had occurred in the past two days. *Frank, and poor David. I wonder how many others had been killed. I wonder if Carlos...* Then I remembered what the scientist had said in the ambulance. The beast had a craving for human flesh. I bolted up in my bed.

*Why did it go for the sloppy joe cans first?*

I was unemployed for 7 months before getting a ""facilities engineer"" job with the help of a friend. I put quotes around that because it isn't engineering at all. It pays $14.50/hr and an 18 year old fresh out of high school could do the job. No degree required at all. I've been at this job for less than a week and I'm finding out nearly everyone in my department is either leaving or trying to leave because the pay and benefits are so bad. Did I mention that the work isn't relevant at all to what I want my career to be in? Because there's that too. Its a small pharmaceutical manufacturing company but I've always dreamed of working in aerospace. 

The dream of working at either NASA, Lockheed, Boeing, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, XCOR, Masten, etc is 90% of the reason I went into engineering in the first place. Space has always been my passion, both personal and professional, and it always will be. I become giddy like a little girl when I start talking about space travel and exploration. I've been reading about rockets, space, astronomy, and physics since I was in middle school. My point is, is that I know it's what I'm interested in and what I want to dedicate my life too. Considering a lot of people don't have a passion, I consider myself lucky in that regard. 

What I haven't been so lucky in is the job front. I applied to over 150 positions (mostly aerospace but not all) with zero luck. I only started getting interviews when I began working with a staffing agency. I was getting interviews but none for jobs I actually wanted to work. One job was actually a manual labor/assembly line job disguised as a test engineering job. There were about 4 or 5 of these interviews total. The more I went on, the more I realized that I don't think I'll be happy in much less than aerospace. 

I made some mistakes in college, namely not getting an internship. I had good grades and graduated with ~3.5GPA but the lack of experience is killing me. The trap of ""you'll have no problem getting a job after graduation with an engineering degree!"" sucked me right in. Without pointing fingers too much, I was literally told by a career counselor at my school that I wouldn't have any trouble finding something even without internship experience. Once I started realizing how screwed I was by around my junior year, it seemed like it was too late. My last 2 summers I tried to find something but always turned up empty handed. It wasn't as easy finding an internship as I thought it would be. 

The choice I'm facing now is whether I want to start applying for grad schools. I haven't even taken the GRE yet. There are some pros and cons to grad school. First the pros:

* I'd be pursing something I'm very interested in. This is something that's pretty important to me. More so than a huge paycheck. 

* I get to get the hell out of the state I currently live in. I don't really fit in with the southern culture here whatsoever and its something I've been looking forward to freeing myself of for several years. I've been itching to move out west for quite a while now where I can actually see myself living in the future. 

* Taking charge of my future and going after what I want is something I really wish to change about myself. This might be a little nebulous but bear with me. I often feel like I take the ""path of least resistance"" through life and I'm terrified that I'll end up as just another guy who hates his job but sucks it up because he has no other option. That's where I see myself heading if I continue what I'm doing now. Going to grad school, busting my ass networking, making connections, doing research and just generally putting more effort into my life would be a step in the direction towards becoming the person I want to be. 

* I would again be eligible for internships and co-ops. You pretty much can't get either without being a student and I desperately need one. Yes, I realize there are some exceptions to this but being realistic, my odds of getting one are small. 

* An MS would put me ahead of the hordes of people applying for entry level jobs with just a BS. 

* This is a bit of a stretch but hopefully the job market would improve by the time I graduated. 

Now for the cons and concerns I have about even getting accepted:

* Time commitment. The time itself isn't as big a deal to me as losing potential earnings while I'm not working for a couple years is. 

* Finances. **I would only consider grad school if I got my tuition waived somehow.** I have a nontrivial (but not huge either) amount of debt from undergrad to contend with. I don't have any research experience so getting funding might not happen. I'm poor as fuck so I'd definitely get need based financial aid, however. That combined with maybe a partial waiver might be enough. 

* There is always the possibility that I end up in the exact same spot 2-3 years from now. The job market might be worse. I still might not have a co-op. In that case, the MS would have been a waste more than likely. 

* Like I mentioned earlier, I didn't do any research in undergrad. I didn't really cozy up to any professors for letters of rec either because I never really wanted to do grad school. For these reasons, I'm concerned that I would even be able to get in. I'd rather not waste several hundred dollars in GRE costs and application fees just to be rejected. 

I just don't like where I'm headed right now at my current job. There isn't a whole lot of room for advancement even if I wanted to stay there. I'm not learning any real skills and I'm not making hardly any money. 

*I just don't see how my situation will change in the future if I stick with what I'm doing now.*&lt;---This right there is what is really bothering me. Other than having some not-so-relevant experience on my resume if I stayed a year, nothing will change aside from me simply getting lucky with either an online application or a friend helping me out. I can't really rely on those. 

What the fuck should I do?"

I have a problem about taking responsible choices. 

It's not like I do drugs, or am an alcoholic. But a lot of times given some choices I make the wrong one and I feel out of control.

I have got a lot of plans in the future and I have the skills to execute them all. But as soon as I lose interest I can't get myself motivated enough to it. Right now I'm nearly screwing up an internship because I can't get myself motivated enough to write the documents. On the other hand, when I do work on something I can achieve lots of things in very little time. I do not mean to gloat, but I do not lack any intelligence.

Also when me and my friends go out, I always want to go till the bitter end. Even when my body can't keep up. ""I haven't slept for 36 hours? Sure I can stay drinking till 4AM!"". I'm not addicted to alcohol, but also ever since I quit smoking a month ago I started binge drinking whenever we are out. Last Saturday the gay pride was in Amsterdam and when I got back to the local bar in my hometown I tried to do the cold water challenge on Facebook. Someone filmed me while I jumped in the water. I was so wasted that it seriously looked like I was on XTC ( I have done XTC before and that's actually how it felt, minus the incredible need for water and the drug hangover) so I saw the footage and couldn't post it on Facebook. I knew I was wasted but I was even shocked to see myself like that. All while half of my friends went home at a reasonable time. I could have done that.. but I didn't.

Does anyone has any advice on helping to change me?

I love CS and I love working on any projects that come to mind, but sitting in a classroom with an instructor doing nothing but telling me stuff that I already know isn't something I can deal with. Of course I learned various things, but 90% of the time I was half asleep due to me already knowing the subject at hand.

Background:  

1. HTML/CSS/PHP/JS (among others that I don't feel qualified fully to say here) 5 years
1. Java (mostly Android) 4 years
1. C++ 2 years
1. Many others that I have played around with but I wouldn't call myself fluent.

With Java I have built a few Android apps, one having ~50,000 installs. I have also made a few open source projects and have been contacted by a Googler recently about one of them, he said he would love to recommend me for an internship.

Now I know not having a degree in this field isn't the best option, and that no matter what others are out there better than me, but what is the market like for those with pure experience?"

I'm a summer intern at a private company with an all Windows environment and a few of our CSRs have been reporting that their workstations freeze up on them around lunchtime for about 5 to 10 minutes. They are unable to do anything until the workstation is done doing whatever it needs to do, it just locks up and doesn't respond to any commands at all.

At first we thought it might be an issue with XP so we upgraded him to 7, still had the issue. We took a look at Symantec since we have their workstations run a daily quick scan around the time they report the issue, nothing there to indicate that Symantec is the culprit. I've been looking at Windows Updates for the past few days but 20+ pages of Google searching hasn't really given me anything that seems to be the likely culprit.

Has anyone else had a similar issue with their workstations? This all started happening about a month ago and my boss and I are grasping at straws trying to figure this out. Thanks for any help/advice that anyone can give me."

Guy submits a support ticket relating to a document he was working on that was subsequently lost on his computer. He comes down to the service desk and explains to me in great detail what he did:

First he received an email from a coworker with the Word document in question attached. He then opened it and began working on it.

But when it came time to save his work (apparently he had put 2 hours into this document) he gets a warning from Word that this document was read-only, and changes could not be saved to this specific instance of the it. So rather than save it as a duplicate (as Word suggests in this situation), he clicked ""don't save changes"", and subsequently lost 2 hours of editing.

In effect, he came down to IT in a pissy mood, demanding that we recover a file he technically never saved anywhere. I stared at him blankly for a few seconds when he finished his story because I couldn't believe that someone with a university degree and decades of work experience didn't understand the meaning of ""read-only"", or that ""don't save changes"" means exactly what it sounds like. 

The end result of this was that he left in a very angry state, convinced that I could have done something to save his work but chose not to. Oh well, it was a great story to share with my coworkers afterward!"

I graduated very recently with a masters in CS. During the course of my studies in the US, I've learn't a lot, be it at the programming job at my university or the internship. Because of my credentials, I could secure a really nice job in a startup. I like this job although the pay is low. It's around $30 an hour. I'm very much satisfied with my job and current position since I like what I do here.

The main issue and rant here is about H1Bs. Amongst the sea of consultants with fake experiences, I really doubt I would be picked for an H1B visa. The very thought of returning to India this early, pains me to a certain extent. Also, I'm making half of what my desi peers who are consultants make. I'm being honest here when I'm saying they cannot even code shit. And half of the desi consultants I know have some sort of a backup in India. 

I know I'm in the wrong here but I have developed extreme hatred for these guys and have stopped talking to them completely mainly because I think of them as unqualified asses making it extremely difficult for genuine candidates to get H1Bs.

These thoughts have been interfering with my life for a certain period of time. I also get thoughts of recording my conversations with these consultancies and report them to DHS but I'm not sure if it is the right thing to do.

We're currently using Highrise, but the person who paid for the license is leaving, and we need to move these contacts.

We primarily run on Mac OSX Mavericks, but a couple people have Windows computers running Windows 8. 

It needs to be able to hold and sort 5000+ contacts, and would preferably be a cloud-based system, as we all use our personal computers at work - we only have one office computer that is used mainly for holding Photoshop and Indesign.

The simpler the better - I am not a tech-savvy individual at all, but I'm the most tech-savvy person here. That might change in the future, but for now it needs to be easy for non-technical people to use. 

Any nonprofit discount would be great; we're currently paying around $25 per month for Highrise, but the lower the better. So far we've looked at using a Google Docs spreadsheet, Constant Contact, and OpenOffice.

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask or if I left out any information, as I said I am not the best with technology. Thanks for your help!

Edit: I think I have a good range of options here, thank you all so much for your help!"
2clmsu,76,2014-08-04,Saving the Titanic....,DartzIRL,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2clmsu/saving_the_titanic/,"My first 'job' was a jobbridge internship with a 'small' company. Small enough that I was literally person number three on the employee roster. The company worked in the renewable energy sector, and had been hammered pretty hard over the last few years by The Recession as domestic and corporate purse strings were pulled tighter and tighter.

I was taken as an Engineer, but rapidly found myself wearing a wide range of hats from Sales, to Customer Support, to System Design, to Project Management, web development in PHP, and finally, IT Support.

Because, one day, I managed to figure out why one of my colleagues couldn't log in to the server upstairs, and correct the problem. 

I will say, the Server was the problem.

It was a dinosaur. It was 14 years old - twice as old as the company - and had been bought second hand. It was a monstrous beige tower with a pentium II processor and God Knows What else inside. It ran Windows Server 2000, and was solely dedicated to serving the company accounts and acting as a networked file storage. Inside the case where four HDD's.... A pair of 9GB ones for the OS and programs, and a pair of 32GB ones for files. Both pairs were mirrored in RAID 1. It had a pair of lockable Zip disk drives still fitted, along with a floppy drive and a CD ROM. 

It creaked as it worked, then fumed, whuffed, whirred and occasionally burped. And it sat there, creaking away for years without thought or consideration to its well being or security. Until I came along.

By this stage, it was obvious the company was dying - the Titanic had hit the iceberg a long time ago, and everything that was happening was just a desperate attempt to bail it out. We might've slowed the sinking - from two months, out to six, even buying a full year -  but the sinking depths of liquidation always loomed.

So, any suggestion of upgrading the server hardware was met by 'With What Money?'. At the same time, everybody knew the server was the lynchpin. If it broke, that was it... company gone. A suggestion that I use a spare computer from home was quietly discouraged - in case the company went under by surprise and someone decided to liquidate it to pay a creditor rather than give it back to me.

The best I could do was schedule a backup of the accounts and a few other critical systems, and have it go somewhere offsite. I asked our webhost if we could use our spare space for it, and they were happy to let it happen, provided we didn't cause them problems. So, I set it to run the backup every Sunday morning - 1am or so. Each successive backup would overwrite the previous because there just wasn't the spare space to hold two (No money to pay for it)

I figured even if the server went pop, or we had a building fire or some other catastrophe, at least those copies would survive. I'd figure out what to run them on afterwards.

Someone, somewhere, should see the potential problem in this. In my defence, I am not, nor ever was, an IT professional. The software education I have is more related to the engineering side of things ... making machines and robotics work with a view towards industrial automation,  rather than the maintenance and setup of IT infrastructure and data security.

I just did what I thought I could to keep the Titanic afloat. 

So, one Monday morning, I come to the office and am met by shrill sound of metal screaming against metal and a high speed. There's a heart-in-mouth moment as I realise that it's coming from the server cabinet.

But, we have backups, I assured myself. The disks are mirrored in RAID 1, so if one drops out, the other should still be clean and working. If that fails, I've my own little backup too....

Unfortunately... that only works if the damaged disk decides to drop out of the array. 

It didn't.

I find this out after I shut it down, remove the deceased disk, and reboot the server. (While googling furiously for a 32GB HDD with a type of cable connector I've never seen before). The death knell is sounded with a simple, innocuous sentence moments after it the server shuffles back online.

&gt;I still can't connect to Sage. It's telling me the accounts Database is corrupted.

There was no anger. No frustration. No real realisation of the gravity of what that meant. Maybe it was just because it was an expected death - like the granny that'd been on lifesupport for too long, and finally decided to shuffle off the mortal coil.

But, we had one last hope!

The server stayed up! Maybe it'd successfully completed the backup before it died or corrupted!

Sure enough, hope shines anew as I find a fresh backup from Sunday sitting there, waiting for me. Filesize looked good. Everything looked golden. There's hope in there that this Titanic might yet not sink. 

We were still afloat, and that dumb little idea I had might've saved the company.

It downloads. It imports. It loads up with the software. There is a moment of rejoicing as it seems that things might just be OK after all. Purchasing. Customer records. Product records. It all looks good. Only invoices remain to be checked.

Do we dare to hope? 

The window populates with records and for one brief moment, all looks well as we scroll on down to the most recent of records. Then Sage locks up solid, and spits out an error. 

Database corruption.

There is a horrible, sinking moment as I begin to piece together what must've happened. It is a dreadful, sickening feeling, like watching the cold waters of the North Atlantic rush in, and me trapped by a locked hatch.

The disk must've initially crashed during the backup - probably as it was about to finish. Instead of dropping out of the array, it remained 'online' for want of a better term, while the backup happened. It spat corrupted data to the backup, making sure it was just corrupt enough to be unusable. It then remained in the array still 'working' and filling its mirror with corrupted data until we arrived in Monday morning to hear the final screams of a Harddisk dying. 

There's a clawing feeling that it was somehow 'My Fault'.... and it probably was. With hindsight, maybe I should've set it to run the backup while we were in the building, rather than at home over the weekend. I could've used an external drive to keep one locally too. There were probably a dozen things that I could've done that'd stop it. 

Nobody blamed me for it, not to my face anyway - but the disappointment was clear. My sole achievement had been to give things a chance, even if they were for naught...

We did finally get things running from a separate backup that'd been taken by chance elsewhere a few weeks earlier, combined with a lot of data re-entry from the papers we had around the office. 

But by then, the damage was done. The remaining disk was on borrowed time at best. 

The Directors called a meeting for a week later.

The Company was wound up and liquidated a month after that, finally slipping beneath the waves on New Year's Eve. 

One of my colleagues took out a bank loan and bought most of the stock and company name, then used it to 'merge' and invest in another company. The other now works in some government thing - and I, after 4 years on the scratcher out of college, finally managed to get a paying job on foot of the experience. (Though with another company, natch).

Before graduating this past June I interned with a magazine publisher and absolutely loved my time there. 
On July 16th they emailed me to tell me they missed having me in the office and asked if I was interested in a position as an Editorial Assistant.  I immediately replied yes, but mentioned I would be out of town until July 29th. They replied that that was fine and that they would set up a time for me to meet with the editor once I got back. 

Right before I returned I emailed them to say exactly when I would be back and said I was looking forward to meeting with the editor and I received no reply. I emailed again, this time simply to the woman who emailed me the first time to say essentially the same thing. She replied saying she was connecting me with the editor by CCing her. Again, i haven't heard anything. 

How should I continue to approach this? Should I let them come to me again since I have reached out since being back or be more persistent? I feel like emailing the editor once more in a few days, but am unsure. 

I was really thrilled about the potential of working with them again, and feel like during my 6 month internship with them I obviously did something right to have them reach out to me. This position really would be a dream straight out of college- I don't want to jeopardize any chance of getting it. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

So as the post title may suggest, I'm an incoming university freshman who is looking to intern in finance next summer.

I will be going to a fairly good, middle-of-the-pack school in Computer science and mathematics.
 Just to sum up my CV quickly, I've maintained a pretty much perfect GPA in high school (the only thing weighing it down is my philosophy grade) and also taken a bunch of courses on coursera - i.e mathematical methods for quant finance, financial engineering part 1 and intro computational finance (in the near future). In addition I've also programmed a little bot/automated trading thing that I'm hoping to use to trade cryptocurrency. I'm also planning on joining the university student investment club when school starts. 

Should I even bother applying ? 
I'm assuming competition is stiff for the kind of internship i'm looking for (in the trading arena) and I know some banks don't even take anyone below junior. Am I better off looking for another kind of internship (investment banking ?) or just not intern in finance until later ?

Thanks for any input.

I'm quite sorry if I have posted this in the wrong place. This is my first attempt to get some insight on this subject, and my first post on reddit. 

I'm a white woman (30 years old) who's been dating a Vietnamese man (also 30) for a little over 3 years. We live together, have a dog, and have planned out our future together. I love Vietnamese culture and desperately wanted to make my in-laws happy; going so far as to let my mother-in-law plan the Asian portion of our wedding. 

My boyfriend recently proposed, but made the huge mistake of not clearing the proposal with his parents. They were on vacation in Vietnam at the time. Perhaps needless to say, they are not thrilled. 

His parents were in the middle of their month long vacation when they found out about the engagement. His mother called and told him that this ""didn't count,"" that she wouldn't recognize it, that he was just a child, and that he had no business at all getting married because he was so ""naive."" Then she told him he dishonored his family, that he had clearly forgotten he was Vietnamese, and that she was too pissed off to talk to him. She let him know that they would have to speak face to face when she got back from Vietnam (three weeks later). She’s home now and still refuses to talk to him, saying his selfishness caused her so much stress that ruined her vacation. 

I'm a college professor with a decent amount of savings, so I'm a non-issue. According to her responses, I literally don't factor into any of this. My fiance (her baby boy) works with developmentally disabled adults for a modest living. Though I think is admirable and shows how loving and selfless he is, his parents don't respect the job because it doesn't make 100K or more a year. He's working towards his MBA now at a prestigious business school, getting an internship at a big company, and doing everything he can to make them happy, but they still say he's a child with no right to get married. 

In three years of dating, she's always been sweet to me. But since she got home, she's now saying things to him like I'm ungrateful and irresponsible. ex: I had a fundraiser 2 years ago to help me with funeral costs for my mother who had passed away. My fiance's family chipped in $200. I sent an email thank-you note, and thanked her in person at a brunch, but she doesn't remember either event. She’s been holding onto that for two years as proof of how selfish and ungrateful I am. 

My fiance can't stand up for himself, and he's so afraid to disappoint his parents, he doesn't stand up for me either. Not like I'd hope for. He isn't weak; he just doesn't want to disappoint them. And neither do I, frankly.  I know how much pleasing his parents means to him. I'm sticking with him for the rest of my life, but this is just the suck right now.

We wanted to get married in May of next year, but his parents are almost certainly going to shoot that down. He thinks that as soon as he gets his 100K+ a year job that they'll be completely accepting of any other choices he makes including marrying me. So I guess I'll have to wait at least another year to try and make them happy. The thought of waiting another year pisses me right off, but I'll do it to try to make his parents happy. But will they ever be happy? Will this ever stop? Should I tell/encourage/demand for him to stand up for himself? I don't want to come off as a manipulative bitch (he's clearly got enough of that in his life, am I right?) but I don't know how to help him

I have no reason to think that this crap won’t just continue on for the rest of his life. Despite my best efforts, I've never been Asian, so I don't know the first thing about dealing with controlling Asian parent. It seems like they're going to do this forever: First it's getting the MBA, then the 100K job, then the 300 guests wedding at the right Chinese restaurant, then the big house in the right suburb, then the 200K job, then the two new cars, then the best schools for the grandkids...

**TL;DR** - White girl trying my best to understand how to deal with a manipulative Tiger Mom and how to encourage my fiancé to stand up to her (without destroying their relationship).

Have any of your mothers pulled this crap? How did you deal with it? How long will she be pissed off if he stands up to her? What kind of behaviors have you seen from your parents in a similar situation? Any advice/stories would be much appreciated.

2cn660,19,2014-08-04,Did I severely low-ball myself and screw myself out of a decent salary?,Sohcahtoa82,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cn660/did_i_severely_lowball_myself_and_screw_myself/,"I finished my BS in CS this last March, and my school made claims that typical starting salaries for CS grads in my area (Portland, OR) were between $70-80K/year.  As I looked around GlassDoor, it seemed like that was correct.  Software engineers were getting paid $65-90k/year.

But when I started looking for work after graduation (Yeah, I know, I should have started sooner, but I'm not sure how relevant that is), recruiters were telling me that the positions they were looking to fill would pay $40-45k/year.  Only one job I looked at said that $70k was reasonable, the rest basically laughed at my expectation of $70k.

So during the interview for the job I ended up starting in May, he asked what kind of salary I was looking for, I was honest and said ""Well, my school told me I could should earn 70-80K, but recruiters have been telling me I should be happy with $50K"" and he said ""I can get you 50.""

And I didn't argue it, and I'm really wondering if I should have.

FWIW, I didn't get the job through a recruiter, but I *am* working through a contractor for a larger company.  I also had a 16-month internship on my resume, plus could show examples of my coding on personal projects.

My school had an alumni BBQ a month ago, and I talked to some of my classmates who had found jobs, and they reported making $45-50K, so I'm wondering if its more likely that starting salaries in my area have just dropped through the floor in the last couple years, or are we all just getting horrendously low-balled?

Did I screw myself over and get myself a salary far below what I'm actually worth?"

From graduation to job.,[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/2cny50/details_on_a_success_story_from_graduation_to_job/,"I'd like to take some time to detail my experience over the last six months since I graduated. I have certainly used reddit in the past for advise, and hopefully I can give back in this way.

**Graduation**

I should state right way the my major is in Engineering. (B.A.Sc. Major in mechatronic systems engineering)
I was advised by faculty to start applying for jobs prior to graduation. This was sound advise and to be honest I should have started before my last semester; however, instead I began applying last October, two months before my last days. Prior to sending out any resumes I made sure to get in contact with my Co Op coordinator who worked very close to the students. She was able to book me with ~~career services~~ local Co Op services and also give counsel on any steps that I needed to take. At the time my resume had been formatted for Co Op jobs so we went over and edited it to meet the standards of templates found on the school website.

* At this point in time my resume was two pages and held information about my internship, projects, education, volunteer work, and lists of skills [mi]

* There was no instruction through my school on the procedures to take once out of school. Talking to advisers right away will allow you to get yourself on the right track.

Once this was done I began applying. My University has a mailing list that sends out bulk emails of job posting that go through the University.

* I would like to point out that I had to make sure I was on this mailing list. If you are going through university check to make sure there is a similar program. I will point out why later.

I began by applying to two companies that had a posting through this service. I received requests for phone interviews from both of these companies, and I was banking on the idea that I would get a job right away. Sure enough I was turned down by one, and I have yet to receive a confirmation from the second despite multiple attempts to contact them. I had wasted my time, and the new year started. [mi]

**Job Hunting**

From this point forward, it was about doing anything and everything in my power to land a job. I started applying to anything that looked promising on career websites, and through my schools mailing system. At first I only knew of a few websites, but I asked people I knew of there knowledge on sites and slowly began to spread the number of websites I applied to.

Most of these led to career forms that needed to be filled out, which meant many documents and text boxes had to be completed. 

* I hate doing this. It is monotonous and obnoxious. So I tried to save myself work my creating a master resume and cover letter and editing them for multiple occasions. As I was trying to apply for many entry level jobs, this led to an Mechanical Engineer doc, Electrical Engineer doc, Computer Engineer doc, etc

* Later I uploaded the folder to drop box so I could edit and use these files anywhere I wanted.

* I also never deleted any old files. I made sure to keep the revisions and the old documents so I could double check work from my past.

I also started a LinkedIn profile and populated it with as much information as I possible could. I added as many contacts as I could. Ultimately though, no one ever taught me how to use LinkedIn as a resource.

* I advise looking to career services to teach you how to use LinkedIn once you have to fully set up. It has to do with talking to the right people on it, and being an introvert it didn't make much sense to me. I might have been able to use this resource better had I known ahead of time.

From January to July of this year I achieved five interviews using this method. Suffice it to say, I turned down by four of them and have not yet heard from the fifth.

**What I learned**

* In my local area there is a large surge of entry level computer engineer jobs. A good amount of mechanical and some electrical. I tried applying to all of these, but in the end without having a degree that specialized in these areas I felt held back. I should have focused on jobs that were in my field.

* My Co Op was in the wrong business. I did a Co Op in my University laboratory. It was a wonderful experience and I learned much about consultations, modeling, and engineering business. What I was never told, was that Co Ops are meant to be ""shoe ins"". They exists to get you in the door of a company so that when you graduate you have a job right away. However, I was not going to graduate just to work in a laboratory for my University, and this devalued my Co Op experience. (That is an understatement. It was worthless in job hunting.)

^ My career advisers confirmed this. They were first very confused that my Co Op had not been focused on the exact industry I wanted to get into and their strategy to assist me was either, A. Have you talked to your old Co Op boss, or B. Lets see how you can use your Co Op experience in your job hunt.

* My resume sucked despite having it reviewed five times by my school advisers. Since I started I must have edited near two dozen times. The best edits have come from Reddit users. I happened to come across a thread in /r/jobs posted by /u/moonpuncher. He was giving advise for free and I took advantage of that. He disclaimed that he was going to be harsh, but that was what I wanted. In the end my resume was one page, focused and lacked any unnecessary information.
To add to my shout out, I believe he said that he works over in /r/Resumes, and /u/moonpuncher did a much better job at organizing my resume than any of my school advisers did.

* My cover letter sucked. I thought they were good, but as it turns out there is always more to know. I made two appointments with my schools career services, who devoted an hour each into reviewing my documents. This helped me understand the types of information a cover letter needs, and doesn't need. As well as how to say certain things. For example, re addressing why you want to apply to the company in the final paragraph AND restate your contact information so it is there for convenience. Also adding a paragraph at the start describing why you even enjoy what your doing. My first drafts lacked these elements and focused to much on describing my experiences. To date I have edited my cover letters close to four dozen times.

* I made sure to ask companies that turned me down, what they thought of my documents and interview and if they had any advise to give. Most did not reply. However, several did and it was well worth it in the end. Any feedback you can get is a bright light inside a vast darkness that is 'how to apply properly to a job'.

* I learned that in many companies eyes, my documents were in fact strong. However, I still was not in fact getting hired. This left me to believe my interview skills lacked. I honestly still don't know what I did wrong despite trying to ask.

* I was contacted by every company that posted through my university. It may have been because they were looking for students. Regardless, if your university has a mailing list for job opportunities, use them. 

**How I coped**

One of the hardest things about this period of time is the stress that builds up while I was job searching. It was nothing I was prepared for. I had seen friends go through hard times and describe depression, but never understood before I started job searching. In the first months I would worry about certain outcomes, like if I couldn't find a job and have to live on the streets. Irrational things that were worse case scenarios. I could usually push past this though and keep trying each week. After three months or so the situation started to weigh on me. I felt as if I had weight on my chest at all times. I felt down and couldn't get happy. I talked to my SO many times about it and she was great, but talking about it couldn't resolve the feeling. I knew only finding a job would make me feel better. The idea of having student loans and expenses proved to hard of a thought to cope with.

I made sure that during this time, I forced myself to reflect on why I was feeling that way and take a break from job searching. Try to do something I enjoyed, and calm myself even a bit, because I would need the attitude going back into search more. My friends who had gone through depression and got help were able to give me good advise and tips.

While I did search I always tried to keep the attitude that there is more to learn. That if I haven't got a job yet I need to find something else out, so always question where you can to add to your knowledge.

**What worked &amp; what didn't**

In the end I had applied to ~60 companies using online websites, ~15 through my university mail system and ~10 through career fairs, and averaged ~one interview/month. (apparently this is high from what career services told me).

Despite this I did not get a job from any of these methods.

What ended up working for me was searching local companies with the tag ""robotics"" going through them and phoning them up. I had been told previously at an engineering event that the best method is to just walk into a company and ask to talk about employment. Again, being an introvert phoning them up seemed to be the next best thing.
I was invited to a tour of a small company, and when I walked in it was obvious that everything they did were directly related to things I had learned in school.

I informed the owner, that if he had any work, I would be more than happy to take on projects big or small and in my follow up email that I would be willing to volunteer for work experience. He got back to me saying that he did not like the idea of me working for free and offered to let me work a trial period to see if we could work out.

It has now been three weeks and the owner has expressed multiple times how impressed he is with my work, and is excited to work with me in the future.

I would also like to add that after a while I decided I needed to regular job to start making money again. I ran into the same problems where nobody was hiring me. I couldn't even land a job at the local retailers or food markets which were posting jobs on their sites every two weeks.
I then tried replying to job postings on Craigslist. I remember applying for ten jobs on a Sunday and getting two call backs the next Monday. I had interviews the next Tuesday and Wednesday, and was given a job by the end of the week. Both of these hits were from reputable companies and offered good opportunities. It just so happened that I was able to get in with the robotics job and had to turn down these offers that week.

**-----**

So, I hope this helps someone going through what I did. I am going to go back through this post, as there is definitely going to be things I want to edit, and add.

If anyone would like me to elaborate on anything, please ask. Or else I will just leave this here in hopes it finds someone.

2coojs,2,2014-08-05,Could I have your 2c?,disillusionedandlost,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2coojs/could_i_have_your_2c/,"I’m looking for advice, or maybe even just ideas because I’m running out of hope and am loosing direction. I apologise if this kind of stuff isn’t wanted here (mods remove it) or if it’s a common thing, but I am hoping that I may be able to hear from some engineers here. I tried to keep it short, but it is still quite long. Targeted questions in bold at the end which you can skip to. 

A bit about me

I graduated with a double degree at the end of 2012 with a bachelor of commerce (Finance major) and a bachelor of civil engineering (1st class honours) from an Australian university. I found work last year and worked for 6months (as a site engineer) before my position ended in retrenchment at the end of October 2013. 

I have a total of 10months experience (including internships) but this is not enough to get a job in the Australian market, (everyone wants 2-3 years). The whole industry is also repressed (has been in decline for 36 months according to a contact who is quite senior in GHD, pay is decreasing across the board ect), and companies aren’t offering many, if any, grad positions. Adding to this, general grad employment in Australia is also the lowest it’s been since 1992 (according to financial review). Basically, it’s the worst time possible to be a graduate combined with a very bad time to be an engineer makes for an incredibly bad situation for engineering grads (I personally know of 5 other grad engineers that can’t get engineering work, all of them have good grades). 

I would like to work in geotech, and I’ve now got a job as a soil technician however there is no guarantee my employer will give me an engineering position or when that might occur. There is also another grad engineer working as a soil tech who has been there longer than me, so any positions would go to him. I’m also aware of my decreasing value as an engineer the longer I stay out of an engineering position and will have to compete with ‘fresher’ grads the longer this goes on. 

This whole situation is very demoralising and has me questioning my future. Such questions include: Why is the industry so susceptible to cycles? As much as I like engineering, do I really want to pursue a career that one can find one selves out of work at the drop of a hat? I never want to experience 10months of unemployment (not counting soil tech) again. It’s all business at the end of the day, and it seems to me that engineers have drawn a very short straw (IMO one should be compensated for lack of job security). 

I think perhaps owning a business may be an answer to this problem, (but a grad obviously can’t set up an engineering business (and engineering business still susceptable to cycles)).  So, I’m now reluctantly considering other options, but I’m lost on what to do. I can't really set up any business that makes use of my degrees which is quite saddening.  I’ve also considered going overseas, but thus far all my attempts (mostly NZ) have fallen flat as well as people would, understandably, prefer to hire local applicants. 

So here I am, hoping to gain some perspectives and ideas. If any questions pertain to you, I'd appreciate your input as well as any ideas that you may have that I haven't raised. 

**Do any engineers here have their own business (engineering or not)? Any of them geotech? How do you cope with the cycles? How long did it take you to set up? Is life better as an owner?**

**Any engineers with 2 or more years experience? Is life easier for you? How’s the job security? Any of you guys Australian?** 

**Any engineers here moved away from engineering or changed fields after graduation (or do you know anyone who did)? What are your experiences? What are your thoughts?**

**Does anyone know, if certain civil fields are better and more reliable than others?**

**Anyone here had any experience in the world of finance?** I have a finance degree and I'm not sure whether to use it, or where to go if I do. Although I do know that I don't want to be financial sales man. 

**TL:DR: Grad engineer can't get a start, loosing hope, would appreciate thoughts or ideas, questions in bold**

I'll be heading to bed soon, so apologies if I don't get back to you quickly. "
2coqs6,5,2014-08-05,In need of serious help (possible career change?),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2coqs6/in_need_of_serious_help_possible_career_change/,"Long-time lurker here. It’s my first time posting on reddit, so please gentle. 

A bit of background of my current situation: I'm a recent CS graduate at a top 50 UK university with a 3.32 GPA (not great I know, it’s a really long story) and I have been having some serious trouble looking for an entry job. I actually tried to get a work placement/internship last year, applied for over 40 companies had a handful of interviews, and got loads of resounding no's. 

To be honest, I'm a decent coder at best and I can still get the work done, but it takes a while longer (at times). I worked on a lot of projects which I mention during interviews, I used most of the advice and books from this subreddit (including the crack the coding interview book) to get things started for me, but it’s never worked for me.  

The careers department at my university were very helpful throughout my job search (and they still are), but I feel that I've been stagnant for the past 2 years. My closest friends all had fantastic internships, one of my friends went up against me for a Software Dev job, and he got it (we were the only two candidates btw). I tried to apply for different positions (Dev-Ops, Oracle system analyst etc...) but I still get rejected. 

Considering that these were my very first set of interviews I have attended, I felt that by the end of the summer I would have secured something (since I thought I would improve by the end) but that wasn't the case. Some of the companies didn't bother to give me any feedback, other companies said that ""although your background and experience are impressive, but we went for a better candidate"" and one company went as far to say that I lacked the passion to work for them! 

For the past few months I’ve been applying for graduate roles and internships, and it’s been the same thing for the past 2 years. I look at the feedback they gave me, and worked on what they said I should improve but the response wasn't that great (I couldn't even secure a 2 week internship as a web tester role). I always wanted to become a software developer since high school, but right now I feel the whole world is against me for no reason.

TL;DR – Been having a lot of trouble finding an entry level job for the past 2 years, graduated with an average GPA score, very depressed atm because all my friends are moving up in the career ladder and I'm still at bottom after all the hard work I've put in.

Hard requirements are 1) U.S. Citizenship, and 2) that you be within 2 years of graduation (pre or post) from a degree-seeking program (undergraduate or graduate).

There is no specific language for this position (though Python + scipy + numpy is probably a big plus), the preference instead is on strong general CS fundamentals and interest in solving interesting problems. Broadly speaking, the responsibilities will be to provide assistance to a variety of different research and engineering projects through software development, as need arises (and there is always a need!). This may sound a bit more  vague than your typical dev job listing, but I'd be happy to describe some examples in more detail if anyone would like.

Any input appreciated.",unsurehowtoproceed,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2cp4po/recent_grad_fired_from_first_fulltime_position/,"I provide a very long, detailed synopsis of my story, which I doubt many of you have the time to read in its entirety. If you scroll to the end, I provide a brief summary of my situation. I genuinely appreciate anyone and everyone who can provide me any sort of insight on how to proceed with my career.

I graduated from a large public university in May of 2013 with a degree in Finance and a solid resume featuring multiple internships, most recently as a Financial Analyst for an investment bank consulting firm. 

Upon graduating, I was without a job, but feeling positive about my prospects given my analytical skills, quality education, and very solid work history. After a few months of interviewing, but still without a job, paired with a tumultuous personal life involving the breakup with my serious girlfriend as well as a very stressful home life, I fell into a pretty deep depression. 

I returned to work at the same job I held while in college just as a means to get away from my house and hopefully combat the depression.

Within a month, I finally had a bite. I was offered a full-time position working as an accountant with the University which I received my degree from. It wasn't the exact job I was looking for, but the career potential seemed bright, and it would afford me to eventually pursue an MBA entirely free of cost. At the same time, I was offered a temp-to-perm position as a Financial Analyst with a Fortune 500 company, with the permanent position offering considerably more money than the Accounting position, but I couldn't pass up on the full-time position with my university.

After about a month into the job, I realized the position was quite different than was described throughout the interview process. Rather than having a hands-on role in the higher-level decision making process of the University, I was relegated to more or less troubleshooting the antiquated software package used by my department. At most, I was doing accounting grunt work which should have been automated. 

A few months into the job, I was fired for a rather nondescript reason, with my superior citing only that I would ""come and go from the office at strange times"" -- better known as adjusting my lunch schedule based on the amount of work at hand. I was stunned, and terribly disappointed due to the timing of the firing (one week before Christmas, and a week after signing the lease for an apartment to relocate for work to cut my commute from 30 minutes to 5). 

At the same time, I was relieved. At least I no longer had to do a job which provided me no outlet for developing any transferable skills whatsoever, and I no longer had to deal with my utterly incompetent superiors. 

After a few weeks in the new apartment, I realized just how much of a black eye this would be on my resume. After all, the school I called my alma mater, and my first full-time job, had fired me three months into my employment. Hiring managers at major organizations would immediately dismiss someone with such a track record. 

I became immensely depressed. I spent the next few months working a dead-end job in a restaurant under, once again, utterly braindead management. I eventually left that job due to lack of consistent hours and stress that vastly outweighed the pay. 

In the meantime, I was not actively looking for full-time employment in the slightest. The main reason was wanting to avoid the awful, painstaking process of sending out my resume for dozens of positions, only to have to explain that I was fired under the circumstances I was. I felt nobody would believe that I was unjustly dismissed from my position, and due to my incredibly avoidant nature, am left here, living at home, once again depressed, without even as much as a job prospect. 

**SUMMARY**

I have this long-term inner confidence which has never wavered; I know exactly what I am capable of, and I know one day I will be extremely successful. I have huge ambitions, and have no doubt that one day I will reach the lofty career goals I set for myself back in high school. With that said, I currently have absolutely no confidence in myself in the short-term. I fail to even apply for jobs out of fear that I will not be able to complete the simplest of tasks and will be once again left high and dry with another black eye on my resume. I fear for the awkward conversation in which I stumble over my words to explain how and why I was fired from a position with the school I call my alma mater. I fear for hours turning into days, and days turning into weeks of applying for jobs which I'm interested in, only to be left sitting by my silent phone. I fear for losing all faith in myself, including that steady long-term confidence I have always had in myself. I fear for becoming debilitatingly depressed and continuing to neglect most of my personal relationships out of embarrassment for what I have become. 

I am coming up on eight months having not worked in a true professional setting, and despite knowing that I'm capable of great things, I feel there is little to no hope of me finding a position which has any chance of leading to a fulfilling career. 

If anyone out there has any advice on how to approach my situation, I would truly appreciate any guidance you can provide me. How can I make it clear to companies that I am capable of great things despite my massive gap of employment since my first full-time job which I was fired from? I feel that by now, most companies would assume that the gap in employment was not a choice necessarily, but rather due to nobody else willing to hire me. "

&gt; Hello!

&gt; I took an unpaid internship at a small software development company doing web development and server side handling. I originally got the position because of my hardware experience and had no experience in web development, but took the task of taking on their web development projects and writing code for their product that will be used on their actual software. I'm about to start actually doing server side things for them while still assisting another intern on web development projects.

&gt; It's only been a month but I feel I should be compensated for my time and work in it. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to appropriately ask to be paid. I'm just worried that I'd be fired for asking.
  
Would this be legal in California?  

A reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cmxrc/unpaid_internship_advice/cjh556h) from /u/psychicsword about whether this legal in the United States:

[The determination of whether an internship or training program meets this exclusion depends upon all of the facts and circumstances of each such program.](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm) The following six criteria must be applied when making this determination:

&gt; &gt; 1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;
&gt; &gt; 2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;
&gt;  &gt; 3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;
&gt; &gt; 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;
&gt; &gt; 5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and
&gt; &gt; 6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

&gt; If all of the factors listed above are met, an employment relationship does not exist under the FLSA, and the Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions do not apply to the intern.

&gt; It looks like he 100% meets #5, 6. The employer could probably make an argument that his current job is not unlike the project based classes you often find in almost every computer science program and that he is benefiting by what he is doing because he had no prior experience in software development. This means that his position would comply with #1, 2, 3, and 4. The last one #4 is key. Given that he has absolutely no experience in web development he is likely impeding the development process and not providing immediate advantage with his activities.

&gt; It seems to me like as a non-lawyer that at the very least the employer could make a good case for why his position is legal as an unpaid internship. This would also be a very bad thing for him to do as an unproven employee. Typically suing your first in the field employer isn't a very good mark on your resume or employer persona. He would likely be better off either quitting and getting a different job or sticking it out and learning something while earning nothing.

Assuming most don't know what is going on here ^^^ this is java code.  Since I am applying to software engineer intern positions, I thought it would be cool to put my resume in the format of a java source code file.  I thought this was a good idea because A) its visually attractive B) it displays some modicum of java coding knowledge C) I am set apart from the pack and memorable.  Cons are HR people that see it may be baffled or frustrated?  But I am hoping when that happens it will still be readable for them.  So since most of you probably aren't coders, is this still readable to you? (you can still find the important details without straining too hard)

I also elected to focus more on my schooling and my classes in this resume since I am applying to internships, and I did this at the expense of my previousJobs section which I feel is less relevant since none of them have anything to do with software.  I have read that it is a good idea to not include previous positions that are not directly applicable to the job you're applying for, so this allowed me to include more details of what I study and what skills my studies have allotted me.

So this is a 'self' post. I basically am entering my 4th year of school, and want to move out. I live with strict parents in a suburban area in my city. It's about a 20 minute drive to school (not including parking, walking to class). I took the bus until now, now that my sister doesn't need her car anymore. 

Essentially, my parents are kind of strict and I haven't had much of a social life throughout school. It's also hard having to go really far home every night and not having a place to sleep on the weekends, in regards to social events. Usually don't even bother going out because it's SUCH a hassle (asking, lying, getting back home, can sleepover once a semester and no more). They are a bit more lenient now but I still have to argue with them to do things, and fight for my freedom every day, and deal with them telling me what to do and checking up on me. I also am not allowed to date or drink and have to censor myself. Hard to go out on the weekends because I don't want a conflict - I have only recently been allowed to sleep over at friends' places. 

My Dad is also kind of a dick sometimes and is verbally/emotionally/mentally abusive and my house is REALLY not a study environment... but they have promised that being in the basement, they will not bother me and I can have privacy. I do not know if they will stick to this or if it's true. 

I live with roommates during my summer internship now, and am having a really good time with the independence, freedom, and responsibility. However, during school, I have to decide whether to move out for my last year (8 months September to April) or stay at home.Lately, when I visit home once a month (my internship is far), I'm allowed to sleepover places but even recently, my Dad stated that I've been out of the house so much. They have this thing with being LOCKED INSIDE THE HOUSE. 

My parents are against moving. They are offering me a 'separate' basement suite in their home (has kitchen, laundry, living room, bed, fridge) as well as the car to drive. The gas cost would be about $300/month, as calculated online and through experience. Rent at my school is around $500/month(including internet/utilities). At home, I'd be buying a lot of my groceries as well (almost all, since I'd be in my own 'apartment') and I also pay for everything of my own right now (phone, clothes, toiletries, entertainment).

I have money saved up from school to pay for this one year of living away. I just don't know if it's worth it and if I would save a lot more living at home. Are there any costs I'm not thinking about? Apart from $300 monthly vs. $500 monthly in regards to gas vs. rent, I feel like the rest of the costs are the same. Also, if the costs are not the same, should I avoid the extra debt and just pay tuition with the money I've saved, and not take student loans this year? Should I care about student loans? I'm in a science program but don't know if I'll have a lucrative job after school ends (hint, probably not).

Current Calculations:

THINGS THAT STAY SAME MONTHLY:
200 food
100 toiletries/makeup
100 entertainment
85 cell phone (yes, I am getting screwed over)
50 clothes/shoes/etc

THINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE:
300 gas vs. 500 rent

What do you guys think?

**Tl;dr: Strict and annoying parents, I have money saved up for room + board for this year but student loans would cover tuition. Should I stay home and spend $300/month on gas or rent a place and spend $500/month on rent? Am I missing any costs? Is it almost the same, minus the 1600 extra a year to rent? Or is living at home somehow a lot cheaper and I could just pay my tuition and not incur extra debt? Should I be worried about debt? Also, side note, it sucks being poor and having to support yourself. That is all. Please give feedback! love you all and hope to hear what you think. Help me with life.**"

Anyway, all of the internships I have has have been EE internships. I am wondering if it is possible for me to get a CS internship next year even though all my previous work as been with power engineering and mobile hardware. Should I still list these things on my resume?

I'd love some tips on transitioning into the CS internship mindset! Thanks guys.

My reason for switching is because I enjoy both EE and CS equally but my goal is to stay in the SF Bay Area when I graduate for many personal reasons. Also, I have gotten an A in every CS class I have gotten while my EE classes have been mostly Bs, and I figure a high GPA is a good idea since I want to stay in the SF Bay Area for grad school."

- Recent college graduate in Accounting

- Mediocre-ish GPA (comparatively to classmates)

- Not quite enough credits for CPA

- SOME internship experience



**RESUME/SCREENING** 

I applied for this job about 3 weeks ago and I thought that out of all the jobs I applied for, THIS ONE would be a long shot to get a call back for since it is a lesser-known yet well-established company looking for some relatively experienced candidates.

I was really surprised when I got an email from HR asking to set up a phone interview.  

Lo and behold, the interviewer goes through the standard screening questions/small talk with me when he wraps up saying, ""I'm not going to lie, hooperdoo, I see you've got some experience in these internships, but what got me was this *last thing* on your experience section.""

I'm scanning through my own resume and stop on the item he was talking about...
my position as a **barista** at a hotel/luxury resort company that I added on a whim because it crossed a thin-line to the industry/relevant experience.  So naturally, I asked him why my experience as a coffee lackey caught his eye, and he said it was because that means that I ""HAVE to be good at being nice to people.""



**INTERVIEW**

I was good enough at the screening to get a round of interviews on site a couple days from then.  I'm not going to lie, guys, I did A LOT of preparing.  Though I consider myself outgoing and personable, being put on the spot makes me incredibly uncomfortable and out of my element. The only thing I could do to mitigate that was prep the fuck out of my shit.

- Researched the company, scanned through the 10K
- Researched the industry
- Researched potential questions I would be asked *for this specific position*; I was surprised so many questions popped up when I googled ***(insertpositionhere) interview questions***
- Researched what a decent salary range would be for the position so I knew what to ask for
- Matched up **every. single. bullet.** in the job description with some relevant experience that I had whether it was work, school, or even outside of the career environment
- Wrote notes down so I could study them before I actually walked into the interview

Physical interview attributes that helped a lot:

- Eye contact
- Relaxed open posture, even if you aren't relaxed at the start, settling into a good relaxing, yet erect posture will force you to relax
- Relaxation ='s easier conversation flow
- LISTENING/asking relevant questions.
Example: Interviewer mentioned that the position would be responsible for monitoring the numbers for some of the facilities/factories within the company. I asked, ""Is there a specific way those factories are picked, either regionally/product lines/size?"" Segue into animated discussion about this.
- Writing down/bringing a list of company/industry/position relevant questions

**FINALE**

Funnily enough, each one of my interviewers did ask me about this barista position and we did laugh about it a little bit but I told them that the grunt work that I did in that job taught me how to be patient, have a positive attitude, and ultimately getting along with all my coworkers.

After all the interviews were done and after I went home to retire the suit and heels, I got a call from the point guy at HR who said that the interviewers that I talked to really liked me. He said that the accounting team at this particular branch of the company was *very* tight/close and needed to ensure that they, as well as the person they were hiring, were comfortable conversing with each other.

I'm incredibly excited to send my acceptance email in the morning and I just wanted to tell all of you job hunters that a successful job hunt does not necessarily mean that your direct, relevant job experience will guarantee that you get that job. A lot of it contributes to timing, fit, desires of the company, and even a little luck.  I've been discouraged about the thought of joining the ""real world"" just thinking about my GPA and how I didn't have as much experience as the other candidates etcetc., (I think there was a time period of 4 days where I didn't even go outside, my downtime between spouting out applications was spent playing the sims and eating with some sleep in there.) 


**TL;DR - My miscellaneous position I listed on my resume as a coffee bar barista got me a phone interview and I eventually got the job because all my tipz N trix listed above.**"

I had a bad run with a different degree path and I've changed my major to CSIT (computer systems technology concentration). I was put onto this path because a friend of mine jumped from customer service to an entry level web hosting/linux server admin job in Detroit making about $35k/yr starting, awesome benefits and lots of growth opportunity (I think he makes $45-$50k now and it hasn't even been a year). 

I've always been intuitive with computers but never really applied myself. I taught myself how to navigate DOS really well when I was about 7 or 8 years old but kind of forgot about it. After hearing about my friend's success and not being happy with where I was at I started checking out tutorials on Linux and Java on Code Academy and I'm loving it. I find coding really fascinating and love navigating by command line instead of GUI.

So now I've re enrolled at school, knocked out two summer classes with A's (core curriculum stuff) and I'm registered for fall on my new 2 year degree path. I'm very excited to learn all this stuff but I'm a little hesitant. My advisor said that none of their CSIT courses counted for a 4 year degree, only core classes. I honestly would be happy to just get a starting position with a 2 year degree. My current income is only around $1600 a month at best between waiting tables and the GI Bill and I just really want to move into an income bracket that at least doesn't suck as soon as I can, then do whatever I need to in order to grow further out of that. 

I'm just wondering if a 2 year degree is enough to get my foot in the door somewhere? The course work seems really solid and actually leaves a lot of flexibility to choose which languages you want to learn, so I could shape my education around whatever I like the best. There's also an internship in the last semester that counts as one of my classes, so I assume the program is a feeder into a few companies around my area (the advisor I had didn't know much). Mainly I just hope I'm not being foolish thinking I can get a start in the CSIT field with a 2 year degree. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

**THANKS EVERYONE!**
I wasn't able to get on here for a few days but thanks for the feedback everybody! I'm feeling much more confident moving forward now."

Mid-twenties with a BA in animation and minor in Japanese. I've had two internships one in flash web dev and another in vfx composting. I also studied abroad. I love/hate my degree. I went in wanting to be a storyteller, but my practical professor only saw me fit for VFX because that's where all the ""jobs"" were. I quickly hated it after the internship. I finished my degree very discouraged. On a side note, I was in and out of therapy. 



After college, I tutored English/math (most recent exp resume wise) and became interested in applying my math skills to a career. My current therapist made going back to school seem like ""the answer."" Also, I get government aid for a limited time, so I rushed getting back into school for a BS in Computer engineering without a plan or academic advisement. This lead to me dropping out putting me on academic probation. 50% was because of something personal and the other 50% was because my heart wasn't in it. I was also really burnt out on the college. I've been attending the same school for the past 5 years. They've even pointed out I was well over units as an undergrad. It's in LA ""where the jobs were."" I was originally a screenwriting major. 


Now, I am back with my folks (3 hrs away from LA) unemployed and trying to figure things out. I would really love to make something with my original degree, but every time I try to work on my portfolio the long term is in the back of my mind choking me with anxiety. My classmates with the most success are either very talented or managed to snag a PA job from an internship. I would love to go the PA route, but I think it would be futile without any exp. Animation has to become a hobby/ side project until I become confident again. There are also my friends who teach abroad. The pics on the news feed make it seem attractive, but I am pretty sure most are on contract. I wouldn't know what to do afterwards. I tried for a well known program but didn't get in. I think I should have keep my meds a secret. 


For now, I'm thinking of either

a) pursuing an AA in accounting

b) strengthening the GPA by taking the classes I failed and possibly pursuing the BS in Comp ENg again

c) teaching abroad

d) military 

e) learn a trade



For sure, I need to be employed. I know I need to ""man-up,"" but my self-esteem is wilted.

Junior year I received a paid internship at a trading firm doing level 1 help desk stuff along with other support duties. I left there voluntarily and went to an investment firm where I was responsible for updating the firm to windows 7. I left there after 6 months to finish up my last 3 weeks of my degree.

Next year I am going to a university with an excellent CS program, and I am hoping to get an internship next summer. The company I work for hasn't been hugely successful, and I am essentially the lead developer for the company, although since I am going to college I will no longer be writing code, but answering questions remotely when needed.

My boss has offered me a very high end laptop as a bonus, but he says that for tax reasons it makes more sense for the laptop to be a company laptop, and I just keep working a couple hours a week (he's gone anywhere from two hours a week to 1 hour a month with this), so I am still an employee of the company and can use the company laptop.
This has me a little worried that if I get an internship, there will be some sort of conflict of interest between the internship and my being employed by my current company, which could damage my career. I'm also worried about having the laptop tie me down to my current job, because ideally my work for the company would be limited to emergency situations rather than a mandatory number of hours.
However, I am concerned that if I turn down the laptop I may offend my boss and potentially lose him as a valuable reference.

So the question really boils down to, do I take the laptop, ask for the laptop's value in cash, or should I just leave this job when I go to college?

Thanks for taking the time to help me, I realize this situation (and my explanation) is perhaps a bit convoluted."

A day where I feel like banging my head against a wall and tearing out my hair and throwing my office chair across the room. I've had these days quite a lot recently, and today was one of them.

Alarm. Yawn. Snooze button. Ten more minutes. Again. Ten *more* minutes. Dammit, now I'm late. Shower, skip the shave, toss on something semi-clean, jump in my car, drive to work. Parking garage is full, have to park down the street. Coffee shop...closed for renovations? Come on, this isn't fucking funny.

Alright, down the street to the other coffee shop. *I'm late enough as it is already, so I might as well.* I stopped in and, as the first stroke of luck in the day, I found the line relatively short. I paid for my coffee and left.

This is where it started.

I didn't see the guys moving the furniture as I rounded the corner, but in a moment my coffee had gone flying and I stumbled into the antique vanity they were pulling out of a nearby double-parked moving truck. I hit my head on the glass and felt a crack beneath my fingers as my hand hit and slid across the surface. My head hit the pavement and I think I blacked out for a moment, but the next thing I saw was one of the moving men standing over me. ""Bro, you alright?""

I shook my head and mumbled something I hoped was vaguely seething but came out slurred.I waved him away and then my hand caught my eye. It was dripping blood.

""Fuck fuck fuck!"" I pulled a kleenex out of my jacket and started dabbing my palm that I had cut on the glass. ""You fucking assholes, not even caring about where you--"" I gathered up my things while I berated the people I had carelessly walked into as if it was their fault. ""--better hope I don't sue you!"" I shouted as I walked away. I looked at my palm to see how bad it was bleeding. As I finished wiping the blood away I saw that, despite my hand being very numb, it wasn't cut.

I dabbed at my face and arms to see if I had been cut elsewhere and just bled into my hand, but no, I was physically unharmed (though my pride was another story). Shaking myself mentally, I headed into the office.

The day didn't get better. Tons of paperwork, endless reports, and some asshole intern was causing issues down the hall. TO make it worse, the feeling hadn't come back into my hand for hours...it was like my hand had fallen asleep. After a while I started to get worried...had I suffered some sort of nerve damage in the fall?

I sat there on my lunch break, massaging my digits and feeling nothing. Sighing, I dug in my drawer to find our company's healthcare phone number list and--

I stopped and looked at my hand as I felt something strange. a cold, wet sensation had just come over my middle fingertip. I looked at it and furrowed my brow, rubbing my thumb and middle finger together. In a moment the sensation was gone. I mentally shrugged it away and kept digging in my drawer for--

I lurched back as my hand bent suddenly, the unmistakable feeling of my fingers being struck on a cold surface flashed across my palm like lightning.

I stared at my hand. It went numb again, save for a light stinging sensation left over from the strike. Now as I stared, I began to notice something very odd.

My right hand was slightly tanner than my left. The fingers slightly shorter. And most importantly, the unmistakable mark from a ring I had never worn was wrapped around the fourth finger. Something was definitely off, and my stomach began to twist slightly as I tried to wrap my head around what was going on. My hand had changed?

I was lost in curiosity and dug in my drawer for an inkpad. Finding one, I smeared ink on my left hand and pressed it onto a piece of legal paper. I did the same with my right and then used hand sanitizer and a paper towel to clean up while the ink dried. Once cleared up, I picked up the sheet and examined the two sets of fingerprints.

They were different.

Different sizes, different types of swirls entirely. Even accounting for the differences between left and right fingers, the two prints looked like they were from two different people entirely. Somehow, *this hand was not mine*.

As my mind reeled with what on earth had happened to me, a new sensation hit my hand. something rubber, pressed in the crook between my thumb and forefinger. Cold steel against the inside of my middle, fourth and pinky fingers And a single line of metal against the inside tip of my forefinger. I shuddered as I came to a realization.

This hand was not mine. And wherever my hand was, it was holding a gun."
2crit9,13,2014-08-06,Why you should do personal projects (at least before an internship or first job),iJustLikePhysics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2crit9/why_you_should_do_personal_projects_at_least/,"Everyone always mentions doing side projects. It's a great thing to put on your resume, and it shows interest in programming, but it's not just that. Ultimately, doing a side project forces you to learn a lot of things out in the real world like starting and finishing a project, version control, debugging, testing, prioritizing features, working with a bigger codebase, and less defined requirements. It also makes you a lot better and faster at coding and hones this instinct for better designs and cleaner code that you can't really gain any other way but through practice. These things are so important to learn. 

Yesterday, I got some incredibly disappointing news. I'm not getting a full-time offer back with the team I was interning with at Microsoft. There was a lot discussed over that meeting, and I've thought a lot about it since then, but ultimately the lack of experience I had with big projects, side or otherwise from classes or past internships, was what did me in. I ramped up slower. I didn't know how to debug beyond print statements and reading the entire source code. I wasn't sure where to start work in a big codebase and how to find the patterns within I needed to use for my own work. I may keep up with the recent trends in programming and have a good base for theory and concepts for programming, but none of that is a substitute for the practice, time, effort that goes into a personal project, and the general getting used to that uncomfortable feeling when you're faced with not knowing what to do that happens so often with a side project. 

So if you haven't done a side project, start and **finish** one. I really wish I had done some before this internship started."
2crwh4,3,2014-08-06,Complicated situation and I need advice,needadvice445,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2crwh4/complicated_situation_and_i_need_advice/,"Background: I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at a major public University in the US and I will be graduating in May 2015 (Fall classes start in three weeks) . I have exceptional academic performance (4.0 GPA)  but I started my computer science degree classes slightly later and since I am doubling,  I usually have less technical computer science courses than most of my peers (and a weaker understanding of data structures and algorithms which is very important in interviews) . Furthermore, most/many of my peers have taken a relevant internship in software development this past summer (or even earlier) whereas I have only an unrelated It internship not related to development at all. I do have a few relatively small side projects that I have been working on but I don't think they are anything to write home about and my peers likely have more projects simply due to their course projects.

Since I am coming up on my senior year in a few weeks,  all of this is very discouraging and it makes me feel like I should not even try to apply to any companies (it gets more complicated soon). I also have pretty significant anxiety issues (social anxiety in particular) and depression so interviews are incredibly stressful for me (which gives me more reason to avoid them). Also,  due to my depression, I have been strongly considering suicide once I graduate (I am not asking help about that here, I am only providing context,  I know there are other subreddits out there) . School actually doesn't cause me much stress and I actually enjoy college (academic aspects) and I am very uncertain if the same will be said for working,  but that's besides the point. 

In light of this,  I have been entertaining the thought of getting a master's degree to extend my schooling so I have more time to sort out my issues and prepare for a better job. I know that isn't the best reason to pursue a master's but I also  know that if I pursue a course based masters, I will enjoy it. I am also just finding it very difficult to motivate myself to start applying/interviewing for jobs in light of my anxiety,  depression,  and feeling of inferiority to my peers. 

I also don't think that I will be able to be able overcome my anxiety etc. in time to start applying for jobs this year so a master's degree does seems more hopeful. I should add that breaks from school (e.g summer,  winter) are some of the most stressful times for me and the only real ""breaks""  that I have are when I am in school. Considering that this might be my last school year depending on what happens, I don't want to add an exorbitant amount of stress through interviews and the like as I have enough stressors in my life. 

Basically,  based on my situation,  can anyone provide any advice? (I am not asking for advice on suicide/depression,  I only mentioned that to provide context). Would it worth considering pursuing a masters? Further, is my fear of inferiority amongst my peers justified? (considering how everyone applying at the career fair will be my peers). 

I know the extra debt is a factor but I am fortunate enough to finish my undergraduate with no loans and debt free so although a master's degree will likely force me to take loans, I don't have any current debt. "

I'm doing an internship over summer and staying with a friend, his room mate has moved out and said I could stay here, he was even nice enough to give me the place rent free for the month.

Went out to the pub with them last night and we came back and carried on drinking. Can't remember exactly how it started but we got into a big argument about a load of stuff involving feminism, and the crux of her argument was that I couldn't possibly know what it's like because I'm a white male. She was saying I couldn't have an opinion on anything really.

She came out with wage gap stuff, I said it's all likely a myth and that in western countries you'd be really, really hard pressed to find woman and a man working exactly the same job but getting paid different wages and even if you could find it happening nobody would disagree that it's wrong, but that it'd almost certainly be an isolated case and not some epidemic we have going on in society.

Then she said I'm wrong because I'm a white guy from a nice background, so my opinion is invalid and she somehow managed to shoehorn rape into it too. She basically couldn't prove a single point and ended up just screaming and running off to her room.

Anyway as much as I disagree with her on that stuff we did get along really well before all of it and I can't afford to get kicked out, I'd be pissed off if my friend did kick me out for it but it's a possibility.

What should I do?

I think I'm just going to say sorry the first chance I get and hope it's all forgotten. I shouldn't really have taken the bait so hard and made it awkward for everyone in the room. I've got to say I really hate some of her views, but she's not harming anyone so who cares."

Just a warning I'm sorry for my shitty grammar, its really not my thing.

To start off, I'm working as a risk management intern at a small, laid back insurance company that sells workers compensation insurance.  Being that it is such a small company I do not have an office or a computer so basically I just my mid-2009 MacBook Pro in the conference room and do all of my work from that.  My days usually start with me coming in and not having a lot to do so I'll browse reddit until my workers comp specialist will come give me loss data to write up a report on or some other project, this usually happens about two hours after I've already arrived.  

So my story really starts late last night at home.  My parents left for a mini vacation early yesterday to Niagara Falls so I'm like hell yeah house to myself, whatever I'll have the same thing in two weeks when I move back into school so I'm not thinking oh hey lets have a party it's more like hell I can watch some porn at full blast.  First fuck up.   So here I am jerkin my gerkin and the battery of my computer dies right as I finish up. Being a 2009 model the battery isn't what it used to be and beforehand I caught up on the newest roosterteeth podcast so yeah the battery is spent so I close the lip, set the computer aside, and went off to go play some pool with some friends.  

Fast forward to the next morning.  I wake up and throw my laptop in my bag and head off to my internship.  As I'm pulling into the parking lot my workers comp specialist is right behind me and we walk into the building together.  You have to understand this woman before I go on and finish my story.  This woman is in her late 40s early 50s and is a very cold and demanding person who is unlike anyone else in the office, she doesn't really speak to anyone besides me.  She is also pretty close to my height (right around 6') and is probably pushing 230lbs with this scary ass scowl permanently implanted on her face, pretty intimidating actually.  

So anyways, here we are in the conference room and she is asking me to show her something on one of the reports that I did the previous day so I go to open my computer and it doesn't light up right away so I figure ""oh must be dead"" so I grab my charger and hook 'er up, wait a few seconds, and press the power button.  This is where is all goes wrong.  If you know anything about how macs react when you are starting them back up from a dead battery is you are stuck at the log-in screen for sometimes up to a minute until it will let you move your cursor into the dialog box to type in your password, and for some reason it will start playing a video in the background right away and you don't have any control of even the volume.  So here we are and before I could log into my computer I start hearing grunts and I remember how I drained the battery.  Moan after moan and the sound of skin slapping together echo in the conference room of a 20-something blond girl being ass rammed.  I start freaking out and am trying everything to get the noise to stop and my boss is sitting right there without the scowl for the first time ever and is laughing her fucking ass off, pats me on the back, and says I'll stop back over in a few minutes.  Well at least she wasn't mad.  I'm an idiot.

tl;dr: While sitting with my boss I started up my computer and porn started auto playing.  Generally angry lady laughed it off and walked away.

This is my third posting on cscareerquestions, now.  Here's some background:  I am an EE undergrad student with dabbling knowledge in many areas of CS, theoretical and practical.  I have been interning with my aunt, a tech recruiter who started out in CS back in the days when they were designing the first internet protocols.  These days, there is a 2% unemployment rate in tech (ie: *nobody* is looking for work), so we have been struggling to find the right people for the right jobs.  Just for the record, we are **not** the recruiters coders mention so frequently with distaste.  My aunt has been in the business for many years and has close business relationships with all of her clients.  ie: if we send your resume to the company you're interested in, the head of whichever group is hiring will **immediately** take you into consideration.

That all being said, when we find people who are interesting, what should we be putting in that first message?  For fear of a competing recruiter trying to steal our job, or someone taking it upon themselves to approach the company directly, we can't provide a company name until we're sure you are a) interested and b) qualified.  *(I guarantee that a direct application will get put straight into HR's pile.  I'm sure many of you have experienced the eternal misery that is bureaucratic HR)*
We try to include what languages and tools are currently being used in the project, the team size and the office environment (if we are privy to it), but I'm not sure it's enough.  The words ""my client"" and ""recruiter"" seem to scare half the potentials away immediately.  

What do you, as possibly interested developers and coders, want to hear out of a first message?  Should I be advertising snacks?  Do you want a spiel on why I can't mention the company name?  Any advice is good advice!  I want to end my internship with something useful."

OK - I value education but I'm wondering whether or not to start this path, and whether it would be the best choice for me. 

I'm 28, my background was in music but for various reasons that's no longer an option... Something something something fast forward and I'm currently back with the parents so I can get some knowledge and move onto something else. 

I had planned to do University - but I didn't have enough qualifications to get onto the course and was instructed to do an Access course at College first. I got accepted for a course that had maths on it, and I was kind of looking forward to that (as I know that I need to improve my maths). However they stopped teaching maths beyond GCSE a couple of days before my interview, which rendered the whole thing pretty pointless. 

I've found another course, that apparently will give me enough to get onto the University course. However, I'm kind of second guessing it. The title of it is 'Access to computing', and it seems to cover a little bit of a lot, but not really anything in depth. I kind of feel that it could be a bit of a waste of time when I could be spending the time focusing on things that I would actually like to do (of course there will be elements that cross over) 

I haven't experience in programming, so It's kind of hard for me to say exactly what It is that I want to do. I think that software development would appeal, application or Web Development. The main thing really would be making something that actually get's used by others and that I can be a bit creative with. Graphic design doesn't really appeal, not sure why I'm pointing that out.... 

I'm hoping to do my maths A Level as an external candidate next year (In the US they would be called AP I think) regardless of course.... 

So I'm wondering what the general consensus is on this - I've been told by some that I should just try and get an internship somewhere. Though seeing as I don't really know a fat lot at the moment I don't know what I'd offer.... 

Would a year learning independently with more focus put me in a better position than college in your opinion ?

I have some idea's of things that I would like to build as soon as I'm able to. I'd like to make a database for my mates business on Google apps or something... I'd also like to make some kind of phone app personalised for a particular artist / person. 

So, I hope that I've given enough info on this to get some input, cheers.

2ct24f,6,2014-08-06,I'm a graduate student with a joke of a resume applying for entry level office jobs. Do I need to focus on internships now instead? Advice appreciated,Applicant123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2ct24f/im_a_graduate_student_with_a_joke_of_a_resume/,"The long and short of it is that I have never worked in a professional setting. 

Depression and barely getting by as a student fed the first chunk of time that happened (I used summers to take or make up courses, so I have a 3.0 GPA I got by the skein of my teeth and no work experience). 

In the three months after after graduating from college and not even knowing how to seek advice from my alumni advising services (I should have gone to them immediately--that was mistake 1), my mother essentially made it a condition I go into graduate school for childhood ed to not be kicked out. I was so fucked in the head, living at home, and didn't have the wherewithal to stand up to her and tell her I was going to find work and she was being unsupportive and ultimately hurting me, not helping. She noted I didn't have anything approaching a resume and she was right. This was in 2009-2010. The school was a horrible university I went to on the recommendation of a good friend and based on misrepresentations of the advising department as to how many credits were actually required to graduate, so I actually feel ashamed putting in my on my resume. I'm only using it to explain what I did with the time---a single line with dates. I left in good standing without graduating for a number of reasons, but mostly because I finally realized I hated both my university, the program, and teaching so much I was psychologically incapable of taking the state exams and meeting the requirements to graduate. 


So that was a terrible mistake; those years are gone and I have no real way to explain them that isn't shameful. Not really. I am trying to play up the fact that I actually got good grades and worked hard in unpaid positions in interviews but I know I'm not fooling anyone. 

In the last five years the only work experience I have is domestic gigs/babysitting (paid) and unpaid work or volunteering in daycares and classrooms, all while going to school. As far as I'm concerned--even with a barely-feasible resume now (as in, I can actually list duties related to being a receptionist, administrative assistant, or working a front desk or mail room)--I flushed those years down the toilet and am that much less attractive a job applicant. 

Now, at 27, my graduate school experience isn't an asset, I basically have the work experience of a fresh-out-of-undergrad applicant and zero excuse. I am cut off from the network a university and the mentorship of professors you respect provides. (My school actually charged $50 per month to stay within the alumni career network and I didn't have a resume till a year ago after sitting down and hashing one out with the first friend that gave a shit enough to care, so there are other reasons I didn't push harder at that door when it was open.)

I wasn't in a good place to seek work when I graduated from college and I know that even with a tenuous resume and some references from current clients and from volunteering, I'm actually in worse shape now, even though I'm just looking for ""entry level"" work. I'm competing with more appropriate candidates. 

HERE'S THE POINT (apologies for a wall of text, I had to explain myself): Should I just give up and start looking for unpaid internships instead of jobs, just to say I've done tasks in an professional setting instead of in people's homes if I hope to get a basic office job in the next five years? 

Something horrible happened in a domestic gig that not only reminded me this isn't even the stepping stone to a stable career and a living wage in the next ten years--it's hopeless. It's inconsistent, unstable work that doesn't pay that well and this week I finally encountered a situation where it occurred to me I might be in danger because I'm usually alone with the person employing me/working in their homes.

I've applied to temp agencies--same roadblocks. I have a liberal arts degree and references, but no office experience, no jobs, no value in this economy. Each temp experience, I come in, smile, submit my resume, and it sits to rot. 

I'd be grateful for insight. In the meantime I will keep making notes of what skills those entry level jobs actually ask for, looking over my resume, searching for job sites/temp agencies to send them out to, and getting feedback from friends. (Please try to resist chastising me for bad choices; I can assure you I am already living and breathing my own incredulous self-hatred, fear and regret and have been for the last three years. I am doing my best to stay positive, chatty, and upbeat in interviews because I'm hoping a window will open but most of the time I am well aware I put myself in a situation where I have about as good a chance of winning the lottery as finding a job I can actually be competent in and then develop new skills with actual experience over time.)

1. Build an internal use webapp for data extraction and analysis

    * Should I take this opportunity to try out new technologies? (Sails/node, Django, etc)
1. Write unit tests for large production app
    *  Is there anything ""extra"" I can do to make this sound (or actually be) more technically interesting, or to impress my boss?
1. Dive into AWS and figure out what to do with all of the company's usage data, how to find trends most efficiently, and maybe find interesting stuff in the data

2ctnbq,213,2014-08-06,How I learned to love CryptoLocker,aelfric,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2ctnbq/how_i_learned_to_love_cryptolocker/,"This really isn't my story to tell, but I was involved at the beginning and the end and it illustrates some wrong-headed thinking that is all too common both in the industry and among smaller firms as a whole.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I'm not /u/airz23... I just don't do cute dialogue.

One of my clients is an engineering design firm. I first started consulting with them about 15 years ago, and had a fairly close relationship with the owner. He's an older guy -- mid 60's now -- and had started out as a draftsman but moved with the times into CAD/CAM work. Originally I had been on retainer, but they've needed me a lot less in the last 5 years, so now it's just hourly ""come when we need you"" work.  Most of their IT needs are done by his grand-nephew, but I'm called in whenever the owner sees that he's over his head.

Said nephew is a bright kid, in his late teens and taking computer courses at the local community college. I expect he'll go on and get a CS degree at some point and will do all right for himself. But right now, he suffers from some traits that are common to his age: he believes that any idea that's not his own can't be very good, he's convinced that he knows more than he actually does, and he never plans for failure.

Case in point: about 10 years ago I had set up an on-site backup system that allowed for off-site storage of media. I'm old-school about backups, and believe that you need some form of off-site storage in addition to on-site backups. I had built a backup server that allowed them to plug in HDD's and remove them off-site. Daily's incrementals were done to local fixed media, weekly full's of his CAD/CAM data were done to both local and off-site media, and monthly full's of everything in the company were done to both as well. Their needs had grown over the years, but at most you were talking less than 8TB's of data for a monthly full. I had upgraded the system and HDD's over the years to keep pace with current HDD sizes.

Young nephew wasn't fond of that system. It was Linux-based, and he didn't have any experience with that so that couldn't be good. He pulled it one day, wiped it, and turned it into a Windows Server 2008 box with RAID-5. He started doing desktop backups to it, and used DFS to replicate the file and archive servers over to it. It wasn't a bad setup, except no off-site backups and an over-reliance on only one drive failure at a time. He had planned to use cloud based backups but hadn't realized just how long it would take to replicate the current working set, never mind the CAD/CAM archives or the other corporate data given their internet bandwidth, so that project was never finished. I noticed one time I was on-site and we went round and round about off-site backups to no avail. After all, what could go wrong?

Then came CryptoLocker.

I have no idea how it got onto their network, but it was an admin account. The nephew got called in on Friday night after the owner realized something was up. He spent three days fighting it, until they realized that the countdown had passed. This was after the cryptolocker service went up, so 10 BTC to decrypt, which translated to somewhere around $6500 at that time. It took another day or two to complete the transaction and I got a call late that next week: come over and rebuild the backup system, and... the owner had a favor to ask of me.

I came in and rebuilt the backup system from my backups (ha!). The nephew and I had a long discussion about on-site vs. off-site vs. cloud backups and this time he actually listened. We also talked over the relative merits of RAID as a backup method and by the time we finished, I think he had an understanding of the failure points he had built into his system.

What was the favor? Take the nephew under my wing as a paid intern until he went off to 4-year college. In return owner would re-activate my monthly retainer and would guarantee nephew would listen. When I begged off, he got 4 other firms in the area to hire me on a monthly retainer. Sigh, fine. Best salesman ever.

I put the kid on residential customers for six months. He learned a lot and got an appreciation of just how nice businesses were to work with. Whenever I get start getting annoyed with him his great-uncle gets another one or two local businesses to sign up for retainers... which improves my mood. I've had to move the kid to business accounts just to keep up with the work. 

Gotta love CryptoLocker."
2cu469,85,2014-08-06,The user folder from Hell,thefultonhow,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2cu469/the_user_folder_from_hell/,"[Sorry for the extensive background, but it's kind of necessary to the point of the story.]

I do desktop support for a K-12 independent school.  We give every teacher a Dell laptop with Win7, and we replace 1/4 of the laptops every summer, meaning every teacher gets a new laptop every four years.  The users have local storage on the laptops, as well as a private user folder on the file server.  Because the user folder is not accessible when the teachers take their computers home, most teachers keep all their files on the laptop, but we encourage them to use their user folder as a backup location for their locally-stored files. We have published instructions on how to do this (create folder with today's date, open user profile folder on computer, copy contents to today's-date-folder on network user folder).  Most teachers either have no problem doing this, or don't have any idea how to follow the instructions and politely ask us to do it.  But there are a few teachers who think they know what they're doing, but really don't (of course).

We normally have one or two of the high school students over the summer as interns to help me out with desktop-support tasks.  This summer, we accidentally hired **six** interns, so I decided that I would foist the laptop swaps off on the interns.  I had one who was a graduated senior send out an email to the teachers who were getting a new laptop with the previously published backup instructions attached, and instructions to follow them before coming in for the swap.

One user -- let's call her EnglishTeacher, or ET for short -- came in for her laptop swap at around 10am.  I have a workshop area with a countertop running along three walls, with my desk on one side of the area.  The interns were using the other side for the swaps.  They had already done a few other swaps that went totally without incident, so I was derping around on my computer, sorta kinda paying a bit of attention to what was going on on the other side of the room, but not really.

I got distracted from my derping by something along the lines of the following...

&gt; Student: Have you backed your files up already?

&gt; ET: Yeah, but they're kind of a little bit disorganized.  I was hoping you could help me clean them up a bit.

Uh-oh.

&gt; Me: Did you follow the instructions?

&gt; ET: Yes, but when you had that workshop a couple of years ago, I dragged something to the wrong place, and I couldn't get you to help me fix it.

[Side note: ""that workshop"" was one of several we ran three summers ago to get every existing laptop upgraded from WinXP to Win7.  There were 10-20 teachers in a room; we walked them through how to back up to their user folder, had them start the re-image process, and went to lunch.  When we came back from lunch, the re-image was finished, so we had them log in, explained the changes from XP, and instructed them on how to restore their data.  At least, that's how it was supposed to work.  It ended up being a madhouse, because 1/4 of the people in the room were self-sufficient, 1/4 had no idea what they were doing and needed to be helped by 1/4 who were very technically adept, and the final 1/4 asked incessant questions at every step of the way.  We asked people to come to us afterwards if they needed further help or were having any problems.]

&gt; Me: You might remember that we asked you to come to us afterwards if you needed extra help, as we had 15 people in the room... oh, forget it, let's take a look.

I opened her documents on her computer.  Lots of folders.  Oh, dear.  I checked the properties on her documents.  About 30 GB of files.  Oh, dear.

&gt; ET: So it seems like my 7th grade folder has all the other folders in it again, so I renamed it ""7th grade outside"" and the 7th grade folder inside it ""7th grade inside.""

I looked inside ""7th grade outside"" and sure enough, there were most of the folders again, plus the subfolders from the 7th grade folder, plus the ""7th grade inside"" folder.  I opened up the ""7th grade inside"" folder and... oh, dear.  Many of the folders were re-duplicated inside that folder.

&gt; Me: So, you've only edited and created 7th grade files inside the ""7th grade inside"" folder, right?  Or did you ignore that folder and just use the 7th grade outside"" folder?

&gt; ET: No, sometimes I edited the files in one, and sometimes I edited the files in the other.  It was hard to keep track.

&gt; Me: So, you've been doing this for three years?

&gt; Her: Has it really been that long?

&gt; Me: Yes.  And you never thought to come to us with the problem?  ...oh, never mind.

Well, shit.  Time to find a realllllly good duplicate-file checker.  I then opened up her network user folder.  Crap.  There were more duplicates here.  Checked properties again.  I want to say there was about 70 GB in the folder -- and we have block-level deduplication on the filer that holds the user folders.  This was not a simple matter of dragging a couple of folders in the wrong place 3 years ago.

&gt; Me: Okay, let's redo your original backup [I pawned this off on my intern].  You're going to have to leave your laptop here while I get this straightened out.

&gt; Her: When should I come back?  Like an hour from now?

&gt; Me: Errr.  How about I call you when I'm done?

She left.  I installed a duplicate file checker on my workstation and opened her user folder in it.  This was far worse than I thought.  There were some files that had 15-20 copies, some of which were the same and some of which were different.  There was no rhyme or reason to which ones were newer and which ones were older.  I dived in.  It was about 10:45am.

I went to lunch at noon.  Came back at 12:30.  Dived in again.  Ran the duplicate file checker again.   And again.  And again.  Decided to keep the shortest path for each identical file, and then compared files with the same name, keeping the newer one and deleting the older one in 75% of the cases, keeping both files in the other 25%.  Left at the end of the day.  Came back the next day at 8:30 and dived in again.  Combined folders with similar names.  Finally got to a point where I **thought** I had gotten rid of most of the duplicates around 11am.  Copied the 15-20 GB of remaining data to her new laptop.  Called her up and told her to come in.

I don't even know if I managed to train her to not duplicate folders.  I did tell her to stop dragging stuff around -- just right-click, copy, right-click, paste.  Let's hope it sticks.

Really-tl;dr: I spent more than an entire workday trying to clean up duplicates upon duplicates upon duplicates, from ONE user's files."
2cuixi,1,2014-08-06,Advice for a Highschooler,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cuixi/advice_for_a_highschooler/,"Hello everybody. I’ve been having a few questions recently about entering the technology industry, so I’ll explain to you my situation and ask for some advice regarding skills I should develop, precautions to take, and other things that I’m unaware of. But before that, I’ll give you a little bit about my background so that you can see where I’m coming from.

It seems, like many people who end up getting into CS, I took up computing pretty early in my life. Around ten or so, my interest in video games soon took to programming and graphics. This was the kind of hobby that I would do constantly after school, and dedicate endless hours to during the summers. A year of experience at this age, obviously, isn’t exactly equivalent to a year of experience working a job or going to university, however I have developed a very strong foundation in the field. I have a lot of experience in developing games on the web, and my skills with 3d graphics are more than capable.

So here’s my situation: I will be entering my senior year of highschool this fall. My marks are very good, I have aspirations to go to university to get a degree in electrical engineering. Instead of going immediately and getting into debt, I am wondering how practical it would be to jump right into the CS industry after my senior year - maybe something like getting an entry-level developer job or a special internship. That way I could be making money, and getting a little real-world work experience before university. With this I am faced with a number of problems:

- With no previous work experience, other than a carwash and a daycamp, what is the best way to advertise my skills to employers?

- Coming from a rural area, how can I find connections in the technology industry?

- Do you have any words of advice for a naïve highschooler like myself as I’m considering entering the workforce?

My plan so far is to spend some time putting together a website and portfolio for myself, which I can use to show people my personal projects from this point onwards; I have also began a simple development blog as somewhere to write down my thoughts and excitements. (In fact, I was very passionate about this kind of thing about three years ago, but my writing was never good enough. I usually ended up quitting a few paragraphs in - something I am starting to regret!) In short, documentation is everything. But reading some of the posts in the subreddit makes me feel like this is only the tip of the iceberg. Finding a good job will probably take something more than this, which is where I turn to others for more advice. Hence this post. 

Thanks for reading!"

I've been working as an intern since February, for a bigger company whom within the past 1.5 years has created a software development team. I feel like it's almost like a startup but with a lot of money backing it. I have learned more at my internship than I feel like I've learned at school and that's amazing and all but I have terrible self-confidence problems because I'm 30 and just now getting close to graduation. 

So within the past month, one of our interns that graduated in May, took another job and left. Because of this another intern and I were pulled into a conference room and we were told that as soon as we graduate (this coming May), we would have jobs. Now should I take this with a grain of salt, or is this normal practice? The only reason I ask is because nothing is in writing but at the same time, the manager that offered us this told us that at anytime between now and next May, if we feel the need to start interviewing for other jobs, to come talk to him and he will make sure to try and remedy any problems that we are having.

I will be graduating in April 2015. The first two years were basic IT courses (very general stuff). The program had a basic JAVA course as part of the curriculum which I absolutely loved. In the second year, you have to take another JAVA based programming course and a course on algorithm and datastructures. Again I loved the two, which makes me want to work in software development instead of IT. I feel like since I will be graduating in a year, I dont know if its the best idea to switch to comp sci. I am currently working at a co-op as a server configurator. I am investing more time learning JAVA on my own. I am planning on creating android apps as a side project. Do you think I can land an internship by showcasing the apps I work on, or will the whole ITdegree/job really hurt my chances?  "
2cvsgf,2,2014-08-07,DBA vs DEV,careerboi666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cvsgf/dba_vs_dev/,"Hi there,

I'm completing an internship now, and will soon receive an offer as a Developer in a retail-based company. I have also worked on a side project that involved working with the Big Data team in the same company.

I really like the management and small team-size of the Big Data team, as well as their forward-thinking people in charge. From a talk with them, I think I'd be a definite culture fit. The people on the team are enthusiastic about computer and tech in general. However, the only position they have available is a Big Data admin, with possible chances to develop a bit.

The other team, while it also has a great manager, is filled with contractors. They are hard to communicate with, frequently make mistakes, and don't seem to follow good practises. Additionally, the culture is much different due to the team being majorly contractors who leave after a project ends. I feel that if I were to continue working on this team, I would not grow much without significant daily struggle. However, this team would definitely be a developer role. 

Will I lock myself to forever being a DBA if I don't end up coding much? Ideally, I want to grow myself as much as possible such that I can go off on my own at some point. Additionally, I'm worried that I won't be able to go where I want to with DBA skills (Hoping to work in China/HK). 

Thanks a bunch

EDIT: Neglected to mention that the DBA is in a Hadoop/Cassandra environment. The team wanted someone with a background in java, since it seems their DBAs are currently limited by that a lot.

I'm having a hard time finding a company that I really want to work for. The Big 5 (or whatever they are called) are most likely out of question due to my GPA.  Working at my current internship also isn't something I'm interested in due to the scarce work load.  

I have a few interests that have led me to look at Lockheed Martin and I'm started to look at how computer science can be used in the medical field, or hospitals in general.

2cwmed,8,2014-08-07,"I am 27 years old, B.S. in Marketing and Business, looking to get into SW development.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2cwmed/i_am_27_years_old_bs_in_marketing_and_business/,"As the title says, I graduated in 2009 from a great business school with a B.S. in Marketing and Business Administration. I held an internship during college with a prominent tech startup and have worked a few job as a Marketing manager since 2009. Life has been great so far, I can't complain, but I'm itching for more.

I'm now beginning to realize that my current position is not ideal for the long-term and in reality, strict ""marketing"" is not necessarily where I want to hang my hat 20 years from now. In doing some self-reflection I realized I have always been tech-centric at heart, staying up late in middle-school doing Photoshop tutorials and learning the basics of web design through forums. Unfortunately I never really devoted as much time as I should have after moving on to High School but I always dabbled with design and basic front-end programming (HTML and CSS), even until now. This realistically means I'm good with Photoshop and can hack most sites together but in no way would I call myself proficient.

So now faced with the decision to augment my career path, part of me says I'm too old at 27 and the rest of the world seems to say ""you're never too old!"". Rather than be complacent, I'm deciding to get on with it and have spent a week or two researching the best place to get started with programming and what it entails. I mentioned design and front-end work above, but from what I've read, it seems like having solid backend fundamentals will make me a much more well-rounded candidate.

I have started with Python, using ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" and have found that it's AWESOME! I can't get enough. Although more complex, I am finding it much more enjoyable than when I would dredge through CodeAcademy to try and round off my CSS skills and it seems to be reinforcing my decision to go down this road.

So now to the tough part. I know I'm only scratching the tip of the Iceberg and there are different schools of thought out there as to whether being self-taught through online resources and perhaps even bootcamps will make me a ""code monkey"" vs a real programmer with a Comp Sci degree. I'm not looking to make complex avionics software and am more interested in web-based programming (not to say this is simple either). I think my ideal conversion will resemble the convergence of my marketing background with a relatively strong programming skill-set. 

I intend on learning everything I can online (Python, Django, Javascript, PHP, etc), taking some of the MIT/Harvard Intro courses and perhaps enrolling in a Bootcamp to accelerate the whole thing once I'm done with the rest. Oh, I also live in Miami, FL and part of this whole process will probably entail a cross-country move. 

So my questions to you guys are as follows:

1. At the base level- Am I nuts or is this whole thing feasible?
2. From a learning perspective, what would be the best approach to take?
3. Geographically, I am looking at the West Coast but are there any cities in particular that would be ideal for diving deep into this world? San Francisco seems great but is incredibly expensive and seems like a rough place to start if I'm just getting my legs under me.
4. Any other advice from you guys are willing to provide would be beyond helpful!

Sorry for the wall of text! Thanks again!

2cwr11,2,2014-08-07,"At what point in your job search do you decide to accept a non-ideal position, as opposed to continuing your job search and hoping for the position you want?",ElectricGoldfish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2cwr11/at_what_point_in_your_job_search_do_you_decide_to/,"I feel like this question never really gets brought up.

As a student, whenever I'm looking for an internship, I keep an open mind about what kinds of internships I'm willing to apply for and possibly accept.

After-all, the whole point of an internship is to learn and to see what kinds of careers I like, and even if I hate it, it's a fairly short-term position and I know exactly what my options are and what kind of time frame I have for figuring out which one I'm going to accept.

Now that I'm a senior, the thought of looking for long-term positions is a lot scarier. As a full-time employee I think staying for at least 1-2 years is expected, so I have to be more selective about what job I take.

If I was to graduate without an immediate job offer, how long should it be before I stop holding out to see if I can find an ideal position and just accept the next best thing?"

**My Academics:**
I have taken classes in Telecommunications and Digital Signal Processing so far and will be taking VLSI, Analog &amp; Digital Electronics and advanced programming classes from the CS department in my school. Apart from academics, my university has a great internship/Co-op program and I've finished three internships. The third one was at a major semiconductor firm in the SF Bay Area. I have a GPA of 2.9/4.0. 

**My Question About Grad School Applications:**
I've been looking at MSEE programs and it seems that decently ranked institutions have very high academic requirements (high GPA, GRE scores etc.). Even though I might do really well in classes, I know my GPA is not going to rise by that much. Also, grad school applications are due in December of this year, 6 months before I graduate, so admissions officers and professors will see my current transcript. I will be taking the GRE soon, currently my average scores are around 158 for quantitative and 156 for verbal. As for Letters of Recommendation, I know I can get a strong letter from my internship supervisor and a professor I will be working with for my Senior Year Design Project. 

What are my chances of getting into top MSEE programs? How strict are schools on the ""3.0 minimum cumulative GPA""? Do my internship experiences make up for my low GPA?

I have begun to put out feelers to see what other local companies pay for someone with my skill set and experience level, and I'm finding that the average salary is between ~$50k and ~$75k.  I'm torn because I know that my leaving would temporarily cripple the company (we have taken on a lot more work since I have started), and I see my employer and fellow employees as family.

I have my first technical interview with an amazing company that would change everything for me and my life if I were to get the job. My only problem is a deathly scared I will not do well for many different reasons.

Some background I got an information systems degree in school and it was all well and dandy. I went into an SQA internship my last year for 6 months and then did some business analyst work after for about a year. During that year I did not do any programming and lost much of the formal training I received in school. After my BA work I went into a programmer position when I moved cities. The only downside is that we use a tool called PowerBuilder which is basically shit and doesn't perfectly translate into skills in many modern languages. About all I got is saying I work in an Object oriented language and I’m a programmer. 

So tomorrow I have a technical interview which I assume to access my skills. I have been cramming Java in the last two days and still feel helpless. It is quite difficult to pull memory’s mostly lost, back in two days. 

Any advice or speaking points I should make prior? 

What is I crash and burn? 

I have already passed the personality assessment over the phone with some pretty decent conversation. I spoke to the SQA manager because they mistakenly thought that was the position I was applying for and will speak with the dev boss instead this time.

I have! Would this help?

C#

Java

JavaScript know the basics

Python

13.  Please identify your TOP areas of development expertise (around 2-4) in order of experience. Please focus on your strongest areas only as this helps our engineers calibrate for technical interviews :

Audio / Video

Billing / Payment Testing

Compilers and software tools (linkers, debuggers, IDEs, etc.)

Computer Vision

Concurrency, multithreading, synchronization

Database internals

Distributed systems

Embedded software and real-time systems

Front-end

He showed me her picture on Facebook, her fake boobs belong on some reality-TV show. I can’t believe I agreed to come all the way out here in the middle of nowhere to meet his family, the family that he says he’s not at all close with. The mom that cares more about her white carpetting and backyard in-ground pool than her own son, and the dad that was so pissed that Josh didn’t get into an Ivy League that he cut him off and made him pay for his own tuition, even though they’re loaded. But it’s for “his own good”. Right. I don’t want to meet them. Ever since we’d gotten close enough to share the truth about our lives I’ve hated them for him, just like he’s hated my mom for me. 


Driving through these brick-paved roads and tiny, barely-air conditioned houses that haven’t been changed in fifty years, it’s hard to believe somewhere in this shit-stain on a map, live two multi-millionaires in their Barbie dream mansion. I check the GPS again to make sure i’m still following the blue line, showing me my destination. Take a left and …. Oh my god they have a street named after them. 


Definitely a multi-million dollar mansion; is a gate with an intercom really needed in this town? “Yeah, uh, Sofia Gutierrez, Josh’s girlfriend?”
“Come on in.”
Thank God there aren’t any cameras, i’m rolling my eyes like crazy. Josh is out front wearing the blue long-sleeved shirt I like so much on him, God I really did miss him. I jump out of my car and into his arms, he smells like my Old Spice. “God Sof, I feel like your hair is curlier than last month” he grins. I roll my eyes and smack his chest, “You would know, your obsessed with my curls.”

“Hello, Sofia.” She’s smiling but it doesn’t reach her eyes, she looks like a stepford robot. “So nice to finally meet you, I’m Fiona, Josh’s mother.”
“Nice to meet you Mrs. Parker” I’m trying so hard to be polite right now. I know Josh doesn’t exactly value his parents’ opinions, but I do want to make a good impression. “Let me call Gerald to grab your bags, Gerald!” A mid-thirties man of average appearance comes to grab my suitcase and backpack out of my car, “I can go park your car out back, Miss Sofia, if you give me your keys?” I hand them to him as Josh grabs my hand. “Come on babe, I’ll show you your room for the summer!” He’s like a puppy sometimes, so much energy and eagerness! But that is what I love about him. 


My room is on the second floor apparently, across from his room, and snuggled in between the two is a cozy little living room area with a flatscreen, and a bathroom on the other end of the room. “Is it just us on the whole floor?”
“Yeah babe, isn’t it great? My brother is staying up at Brown this summer for an internship! We get the whole place to ourselves” He wiggles his eyebrows suggestively and I scoff and roll my eyes, “Don’t get any ideas! I’m not getting kicked out on the first night!” We start heading back downstairs and I get a view of the town outside the window. It really is tiny. A few blocks away I can see a grocery store and a kwik shop, and several houses all boxed together. There’s what looks like some type of wooded area too. “So, what are we doing for dinner?”
“Mom said we could just grab a pizza from the grocery store tonight, our cook has the night off and Mom wouldn’t know how to make Ice if we didn’t have a machine to do it for her.”
“Okay great.” I laugh. 
“Oh and after dinner, I told my old Highschool friend, Rob that we’d meet him out in the woods! You know, dude stuff. I told him you’re cool though, about hiking and shit like that.” 


After pizza we head to the woods I spotted from the second floor window. “It’s a bit of a hike babe, you have sneakers on right?”
“Yeah I do, how far is… wait where are we even going?”
“Not sure. Rob told me to walk to the river we used to meet at and we’d hike from there, river’s just ahead.” I could already hear the water, so it had to be close. 
“Dude!” I see a tall guy, tan with dark hair and impeccably muscled. 
“Rob! How are you man, has it only been two years? It feels like forever!”
“This the girl?” He turns a flirty smile my way. 
“Yeah, I’m Sofia.” I give him a firm handshake and no smile. I know his type, they’re all over back home in Cali. “Cool! Well, hope you don’t scare easy, church ’s about 2 miles from here.”
“Church?”
“Yeah old condemned church! My Gram mentioned it about a week ago and I havent had time to check it out yet!”
“Why do you want to go to some old condemned church, dude? I don’t want asbestus getting in my lungs or any other shit.” Josh has asthma, something like that could give him an attack, shouldn’t his self-proclaimed “best-friend” know that shit?
“Dude,chill. No asbestus, place is just falling apart. It’s weird though isn’t it? We trekked all over these woods when we were kids, and I sure as hell don’t remember any church.”
“Yeah well, we were teenagers, we probably thought it was ‘all over the woods’ and it was half a mile.”
We’re getting in pretty deep and it’s getting dark, Rob throws Josh a flashlight and shrugs, “Sorry, I wasn’t for sure you were comming, I only brought one.” 


I can see it through the trees. It’s an old stone church, and I’m sure it was beautiful once. It’s half caved in at this point, though. It’s not huge but it has an eminent presence that makes it seem so much bigger than it is. It’s all old limestone, even the huge stairs leading up to the door, and the foundation. It’s in a clearing of trees that look older than the houses in town, so it makes me wonder who was hiking through the woods to go to church on Sunday mornings. 
“Guys! Check this out!” It’s coming from behind the church, where Rob wandered off. We trot along the crumbling church’s walls toward the opposite end.


It’s a fucking cemetary.

When I was job hunting, I applied for 25 jobs online and submitted my resume to all of my friends/family connections and also to 10 places that didn't have specific job postings. The only place I heard back from is where I currently work. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but when each application takes 2-3 hours plus writing a unique cover letter, it's a full time job just to apply (as I'm sure many have experienced.)

I'm worried that I won't be able to apply to as many places as I need to (now that I am working 40-60 hrs a week) and that I'll really be desperate in about 3 weeks (when I predict the business will go under.)

What should I do? Should I quit? Should I act like I don't know it's coming? What if they don't have the money to pay me my salary? As a full-time employee, can I claim unemployment if I've only been working there for 6 weeks?

First job out of college, have been there 5 weeks, full-time for only 2. Suspect business to go under in 3 weeks, no professional network in new city. HELP Please!

Ideally  looking for an internship on the IB path but am really just trying to learn as I feel most people go into their majors/career paths without actually knowing what to expect. 

: also if anyone knows where to find a sample resume for econ majors trying to land internships let me know, usually the ones on school website are for graduates or science majors"
2cyced,5,2014-08-08,I think they're still outside (UPDATE 1),goldsaxon,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2cyced/i_think_theyre_still_outside_update_1/,"Hello again. I'm updating my original post, http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2cudkj/i_think_theyre_still_outside/, because some commenters told me to do so and, in all honestly, I don't know what else to do at this point. I'm terrified.

After being stalked last night by two cars, coming face to face with one of the stalkers, and somehow losing an orthotic, I woke up at 8AM this morning in a cold sweat and ran to my window.

Sure enough, the cars were still there. Headlights still on. I threw on some clothes and ran to my parents' room, shouting some garbled nonsense about being followed. My dad groggily got up and walked to my window.

I'm not dumb, and I read plenty of horror stories, so even before he entered my room, I thought to myself: The car is going to be gone, and he's going to be irritated that I woke him up for nothing. I was surprised when my dad's jaw dropped as he gazed out my window.

""Oh my god, Navarre!"" He sounded genuinely horrified. ""That car is parked in a completely unsafe way. I'm going to alert the city.""

Despite my protests of ""Nobody does that"" and ""I think it's following me,"" he left my room. I walked to the window and gasped out loud.

The car had moved into the center of the road, and it was now parked there with headlights off. Had it been moving toward me when it was halted by the sudden presence of my father? I didn't want to know.

I postponed going to cross country practice as long as possible because I was afraid of what the car might do if I walked outside. It would take about ten minutes to jog to the park where my coach planned to meet us, so I stalled for time until ten minutes before practice, watching the motionless car. At exactly 2:50 PM (practice starts at 3), it turned around and drove off.

I leaped up and put on my shoes, not wearing the orthotics today since I only had one. I jogged over to the park. It was an unremarkable journey--no traffic to speak of, and interestingly, no pedestrians.

I met up with my friends, Hannah and Vanji, at the entrance to one of the longer trails where the coach usually meets us. Collectively, the three of us are team captains, as we are all seniors who have been on varsity since freshman year. Today, the coach was late, giving us time to talk.

""Guys,"" I confided to Hannah and Vanji, ""I think this car is following me. It's really freaking me out.""

As if cued by my words, a motor started running in the parking lot outside the mouth of the trail. Though it was obscured by the foliage of the trail entrance, I was sure I could see one tire sloppily parked over the edge of the grass.

""Holy crap, I think it's here,"" I whispered. Hannah and Vanji exchanged looks. ""What? You know I never make stuff like this up!"" I protested.

That was true. Save for a few spirited political outbursts, I was usually the drab friend who had no melodramatic episodes. It was unusual for me to be this worked up about anything. But before I could further convince Hannah and Vanji, Coach Nettingdale showed up, wearing his typical polo shirt and athletic shorts.

Hannah, Vanji, and I, along with the fifteen or so other runners, formed a semicircle around Coach as he described today's workout. He wanted us to run halfway up Bridle Trail until we reached a lake that we ""couldn't miss,"" at which point we were to take a smaller fork onto the ominously named Mountain Trail. We'd meet back here in an hour.

""I'm sending runners in groups of three so nobody will get lost,"" Coach Nettingdale added. ""Abandoning your teammates is enough of an offense to get you kicked off this team.""

Hannah and I rolled our eyes. We'd been left behind and lost many times as freshmen and sophomores, and no school action had ever been taken.

""I'm interspersing the captains with the other runners because they know the trail well,"" Coach declared. ""The first group is Hannah, Melanie, and Jane."" The latter two were freshmen who, though fast runners, had a tendency to get lost, which would be a drag on today's run. Coach paired Vanji with two other errant underclassmen, and I got Tawny and Rebecca, similarly impaired runners. The remaining kids all had an adequate sense of direction and didn't need a team captain to lead them.

Five minutes after Vanji and her charges departed up the trail, I led Tawny and Rebecca to the starting point. I tend to scare underclassmen on the team with my no-nonsense persona, although I'm anything but mean. Tawny was a junior who would get lost in her own neighborhood--she was just incapable of recognizing her surroundings. Rebecca was a freshman I didn't particularly like because she didn't pay attention.

""Okay, Tawny, Rebecca,"" I told them. ""We're going to start out at 7:30-mile pace, but if that's too fast, just pull my ponytail,"" I joked. ""I don't want you to get left behind.

""Yes, Navarre,"" Rebecca drawled. She pronounced my name like ""navel,"" which I always had to correct.

""That's 'Navarre,' rhymes with Jafar. Let's go!"" I started running up the trail, my charges within an arm's length. We ran uneventfully for a few minutes. I had totally forgotten about the car in the hectic rush of starting the run. But a cold dread collected in the pit of my stomach when Rebecca, who had darted off ahead (as usual not listening), spotted something odd.

""Hey Navel, are these tire marks?"" she asked petulantly.

I sprinted up and looked. There were tire indentations as if a car had careened wildly out of control. However, that couldn't possibly have happened. The trees surrounding the area were all intact, and there was nowhere for the car to have gone. It didn't make sense.

""That's so weird,"" I muttered. ""Let's get Tawny's opinion.""

I turned around. The redheaded junior was nowhere to be found. ""****,"" I swore, ""where's Tawny?""

""NAVARRE!"" Rebecca screamed, pronouncing my name correctly. My head snapped around. She was staring off into the bushes, where a wild ruckus was taking place. There was an intense crashing, like in a hurricane. I could hear trees snapping. I saw a flash of white.

""Oh my god, it's like ******* Christine!"" Rebecca screamed. Christine, the killer car from the Stephen King novel, my mind somehow registered. The white car was hurtling insanely through these woods, searching for me.

Miraculously, I kept calm and carried on. ""Rebecca, go back down the trail and find Coach's van. Don't as much as step off the trail. If you see Tawny, text me. I'll stay here and look for her."" Something in my eyes told her not to argue. She bolted off, faster than she'd ever run in a race.

""Tawny?"" I called quietly. I thought the car had streaked away, because the thunderous crashing sounded more distant. ""Tawny?""

I saw a pale lump against a nearby tree stump. On top of it was a frizz of red. I quickly looked away--I couldn't bring myself to stare at the entity. I was CONVINCED it was Tawny's corpse, and that she had somehow, in the three minutes she'd been absent, died.

Obviously, she wasn't dead. When she heard me calling her, her green eyes looked up at mine, and there was something indescribable in those eyes that scared the heck out of me. She KNEW. It's hard to explain what that means, but if you saw her face, you'd see it too. It's a terrible example, but the closest thing I can think of is the look Brad and Janet exchange at the end of Rocky Horror, after everything has happened and they KNOW something they didn't before. Something awful. Tawny had that look. Something was very, very wrong with her.

""Tawny, what's happened?"" I asked her, keeping an eye out for the car.

She wouldn't, or couldn't, speak, just sat numbly at the base of the tree.

""Come on, Tawny, we need to get back to Coach's van. These woods aren't safe. I just saw a--""

I heard it. The crashing. The car was coming closer. I bit back a wave of panic--after all, it hadn't seen me before. ""Let's go,"" I hissed. But I couldn't get Tawny to stand up.

Another jogger appeared in the distance, moving quickly and effortlessly. I thought of asking him for help, but then I saw his white shirt. I didn't know if it was the same man, but I'd bet on it.

I could swear I heard him holler, ""Try and keep up.""

When Tawny saw the figure, she stood up, and we ran in the opposite direction, back down the trail. Except there WAS no base of the trail. We were back where we had first seen the car, and it was getting closer. In addition to being terrified, I was beyond confused. I don't believe in the supernatural, and I won't claim the woods were rearranging themselves to trap us. Somehow, we'd gotten turned around and made to believe we were moving in the right direction when we actually weren't.

I pulled Tawny in the opposite direction, yanking us under a steep hill. Unfortunately, the car pulled to a halt directly in front of us. Despite having crashed through all the shrubbery of the forest, it didn't have a scratch on it. I'm terrible at categorizing cars, but I noticed that it had no visible logo.

It had tinted windows, which seemed to me somehow inconsistent. Then I remembered I'd seen the woman driver before through the windows. They weren't tinted--they'd been painted. Tawny was petrified. Catatonic. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911. Without waiting for the respondent to say hello, I blurted, ""Help. I'm on Bridle Trail and I'm being followed by a white car. It's right in front of us. I also might be reporting a missing person by the name of Rebecca Cardoni.""

I waited for the person on the other end of the line to say something. When he did, it was a man's voice, and he murmured, ""Try and keep up.""

I dropped the phone, just as a text from Rebecca popped up. It said ""lol"".

LOL? Really? I'd get her for that later. For now, my terrified attention stayed fixed on the car, which only seemed capable of parking with one tire over a raised object. Its front driver's window started to roll down.

I was half expecting the car to be empty, but it was the same brown-haired woman as before. From close by, I could tell who it was.

You know when you look at baby photos of yourself and feel some sort of connection with the infant in the photo, even though it doesn't resemble you at all? That's what happened when I looked the driver in the eye--and I could see her feel it, too.

I screamed. It was ME, maybe twenty years older. I looked awful. The smell of decaying flesh, weed, and cigarette smoke haunted the car. Her--my--hair was scraggly and falling out in places. She was missing teeth.

""What do you want?"" I shrieked.

""Try and keep up,"" a voice raspy from smoking responded. ""And if you can't…"" She held up a glinting object. I nearly vomited. It was MY Swiss army knife, that I'd received before the camping trip I took when I was fourteen.

She drove away in her unscratched car. I helped Tawny to her feet. She was somewhat more coherent now, motionwise, but still unable to speak.

I'll skip the boring twenty minutes of trying to reestablish contact with my teammates. Eventually, we all ended up back at the starting place, and in hushed undertones, discussed the sounds everyone had heard.

""Looks like Navarre wasn't lying,"" Hannah whispered. ""She really does have a stalker.""

""I bet it's Chris,"" one of the juniors declared, and everyone laughed. Chris was a boy in my year who had been infatuated with me since tenth grade. Their laughter infuriated me.

""You think this is funny?"" I demanded. ""Lives are at stake here.""

Coach Nettingdale showed up at that exact moment. He looked furious, and understandably so. He'd been driving around for an hour looking for us, trying to mark our progress on the trail. I guess he must have thought we were skipping running.

""Hannah, Navarre, Evangeline,"" he spat, using Vanji's full name, which was used so seldom we almost forgot it. ""You've ruined a workout for your entire team today. I hereby strip you of your captain's duties on this team. Navarre, because you sent a freshman down the trail alone, you are expelled from this team.""

We all stared at each other, wondering who should start explaining first. Everyone looked at me.

It was then, despite the spotty service in the park, that I received another text. It had been sent over thirty minutes ago, but it lit up my screen just as Coach was staring me down. The text was from Rebecca.

It said: sos*

Her first message, ""lol,"" had been a typo. She'd meant to write ""SOS"".

I looked up at Rebecca, and back at Tawny. Both had blank faces and hadn't responded to anything anyone had said in the last twenty minutes. Suddenly I felt sick to my stomach.

""I--I can explain, Coach,"" I started, pushing this all out of my head for now.

""It wasn't her fault,"" Jane, a freshman, muttered.

""We all heard a--"" I started, but then it was there again. Louder than ever, the crashing, and out of the woods the white car soared onto the pavement.

I wish I could have prevented it, but we were all too blindsided to somehow stop the car from ramming into Coach Nettingdale and throwing him across the parking lot.

I just got home from the police station, where Vanji and I were the only girls with enough common sense to spare the interviewer the unbelievable story of the car in the woods. So we got to leave early while one of the officers lectured the remaining fourteen (Tawny and Rebecca still weren't speaking) about the group delusion they'd experienced. When I left, Tawny and Rebecca were being placed in hospitalized care for shock. Vanji and I wouldn't be allowed to visit because we aren't 18, but an intern was running the visiting desk.

I'm typing this from my laptop that my mom brought me here along with some flowers (I don't know why she brought them; Coach Nettingdale is definitely dead and thus won't appreciate them), and Tawny and Rebecca haven't said a word. I've explained to Vanji the entire thing, and she has a theory I'll transcribe tomorrow. There are some things that don't fit with her theory, and I'll explain those as well.

Thanks for sticking it out; i feel better because you guys are listening. Also, I don't think the white car intends to harm me, or it would've already.

Hold on…I just got a call from my dad. The city reviewed his complaint about the white car parked in the middle of the street, and apparently it was towed at 3:24 PM, which is when it should've been careening through the woods.

For some reason, that scares me most of all."

Path 1: Stay at home, no rent, save up money and hopefully find a 9-5. I can try and build my resume up somehow. I would need 5K extra a year for car insurance for, I don't know, the next 2 years.

There are risks to either path. I'm not sure what I should do. In a way, I feel like the smarter idea is going to Atlanta (I could always go back home if I absolutely end up broke).

If you don't get a better, full-time job with your degree in Atlanta, you won't be saving up much cash"". So yeah, I could just use some objective advice.

**Episode 11: The Return of The Tech**

Hello my old friends! I know it has been over two months since I last posted. I apologize for letting you all down. During the time period of  Episodes 9 and 10, ""Honey I called the electricians"" parts 1 and 2 some things picked up in my life and reddit went on the back burner, but now I am back baby! Be prepared for exciting new tales of my adventures as a new tech. If you guys really want to know what became of our hero the new tech when he faced the separatist $electrician forces, I will gladly fill you guys in, but I will say that not much happened. Now on to the story...

By the way, all new tales will be posted under the name /u/PvtBacon1stClass as I have wanted a new name for a while. This post has also been posted on that account.
__________________________________________________________

We find our hero, the tech cheerfully entering the office... errr I mean his secret base... theeeee ummm the... Coffee Cave. Yes the Coffee Cave.

He is equipped with the bare essentials. 1 cup of hot black coffee and 1 cream cheese bagel. It is a beautiful summer day. All is well in our hero's world for today the IT staff will be moving into their new offices! Yes, while we were away our hero's company renovated the floor that IT is located on. This was great news as the IT department was expanded. The additions included actual offices instead of a single room with desks along the walls and a work table in the middle that provided 2 1/2 feet of space between the workers and the table. It was quite cramped.

The new offices aloud for two IT hero's per office. These offices surround the old 1 room office on 3 sides. In total there at 12 new offices. Not all are filled though. (Hints to expansion perhaps?) The old room still has the work table but also a full area with tools for hardware work, a monitor system that displayed certain data on the server room such as the temperature, humidity, readings on any power fluctuations, etc., and the old tiny closet that was once both a work area and storage space was now plain storage. The IT crew also pitched in and bought a [Delonghi BCO130T Combination Coffee Espresso Machine](http://www.coffeeforless.com/delonghi-bco130t-combination-coffee-espresso-machine.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjw6pGfBRD09M-TmYTBzqIBEiQAcRzH5y2pYDS0OCOp4NBigPIoRxbaL24ixQO_3AL-9Ale2ncaAjUk8P8HAQ#.).

&gt;Me: Hey there Bryan! (My friend who first got me the job at this place)

&gt;Bryan: Oh, hey there Professor_Derpsalot. Guess what? We are office mates!

&gt;Me: Dude this is so epic! I guess we should go set up our computers.

&gt;Bryan: Actually, IT Head had the two interns set them all up for us. Everything is ready for us to get to work without a hitch.

&gt;Me: Hey hold it now, these are interns we are talking about. Are you sure they did it right?

&gt;Bryan: Yup I checked, they got it all right.

&gt;Me: That is a relief. I am so ready to watch the portable we have been in for the summer be carried away. (The IT department has been in portables since a week after the $electricians incidents. Turns out those projectors were a precursor to the renovation that we should have picked up on.) Alright lets get to work.

As we all settled in and rejoiced over our shiny new work environment the head of HR popped in.

&gt;HeadHR: Hey there IT! I just wanted to pop in and ask what you guys all think about the new office.

&gt;HeadIT: It is great! We all love it.

&gt;HeadHR: That's good to hear. Well I will talk to you guys later.

HeadHR had not been through the doorway for 5 seconds when we heard the distinct sound of a pair of black dress boots we had come to fear. Now down in the south where I am, some people opt for black cowboy boots that are well fitted and made as opposed to black dress shoes. You know, the kind that creek with each step because they are so stiff. A large portion of them are ostrich because it is just viewed as more professional. Anyways, there was only one person at our place of work that wore such a pair of boots and he walked very loudly in them. It was the **COO**, ~~perhaps the most incompetent man I have ever met~~ perhaps the best man I have met that is cut out for an executive position at a company.

&gt;COO: Hello there HeadIT, I have a task for your department.

&gt;HeadIT: Oh?

&gt;COO: Yes. You see, I need someone in here to---

&gt;HeadIT: COO, I am sorry, but I need to stop you there. You see, I need to read you a bulletin sent out to the company.

HeadIT proceeds to pull out his phone and go to an email.

&gt;HeadIT: rrrrr hrmm hrmm ""Attention all [Propane Company] employees, from this point forward anyone that has a need at all related to IT no matter how small must use the request or ""ticket"" system to officially submit a request that the task be addressed directly from their own account so that we can keep track of all the fine work that IT does for us. Any employee that has trouble grasping this concept may be viewed as a security risk. Thank you all for your hard work, [Herp Derpson] COO, [Propane Company]."" So as you see [Mr.Derpson] I am going to have to ask you return to  your office and submit a ticket.

The COO opened his mouth as if to produce a retort, but closed it and simply walked out muttering to himself.

&gt;HeadIT: You know how long ago he sent that email? 4 years ago. You know what else, I have had that bookmarked on my home screen for 4 years waiting for the chance to rub that email in his face.

Lol

**10 Minutes Later**

*ding*

The sound of the notification that a ticket had been submitted rang through the offices. And I was the lucky one that just happened to get assigned to it. Lets see... *scroll* *scroll* *scroll* Oh boy, I get the *""pleasure""* of changing out 8 of the computer monitors in the marketing department because someone (A certain boot wearing executive) told them to put them all in one place out in the open during the renovation and a residual ladder had fallen and broken them. But whats more is that apparently this was a mishap on IT for not ensuring the ""proximity safety"" of all the hardware.

What the fuck does that even mean?

I have expressed interest in continuing to work for this company and people (including the engineering manager have been planning on me sticking around). However, since this position is being terminated the company will have to re-hire me as a temp employee through an outside staffing agency. I also know that some of the engineers have briefly talked about there being some openings in the department but there are no official job posting yet.

The HR guy has told me that sometime in the next week or so he will sit down with the manager and discuss this and see what they want to do. But, is it a good idea for me to approach my manager first and inquiry about continuing to work and my desire to come on fulltime if there was a position available before the HR guy talks to him or should I just let HR handle it?

2czh7z,7,2014-08-08,"Already a CS major, trying to figure out which path to take",Atl4s,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2czh7z/already_a_cs_major_trying_to_figure_out_which/,"So I'm a second year computer science major and, though I've only had two CS classes so far, I love it and I'm definitely going to continue pursuing it. My problem is trying to figure out what path to take in terms of course selection.

I'll need to pick a concentration later on, though I'm a bit ahead of schedule so I could probably start taking the classes now. The concentrations range from the hardcore theory and math related ones like artificial intelligence and software engineering, to the less intensive ones (IMO) like internet applications and web design. Aside from the concentration, I'm also currently operating under the idea that I'm minoring in Math and Astronomy, but that may and will likely change.

See, I'm not really sure which path to take, and while these descriptions aren't accurate, I could go the software engineering route or the web design/development route. At least those are the paths that I think I'd be considering anyway.

The software engineering path would probably entail me taking the third calculus class (though it's not required) so that I could take more upper-level math classes and more difficult CS courses. This would very likely lead to me obtaining a minor in Math and also open the door to a minor in Cybersecurity.

The web design/development route, in my mind, is me taking the easiest courses, probably picking up a minor in Interactive Media and concentrating in internet applications, and simply getting the degree with little trouble so I can get out and do real work on my own.

Any advice?

My problem is trying to figure out what path to take in terms of course selection.

I'll need to pick a concentration later on, though I'm a bit ahead of schedule so I could probably start taking the classes now. The concentrations range from the hardcore theory and math related ones like artificial intelligence and software engineering, to the less intensive ones (IMO) like internet applications and web design. Aside from the concentration, I'm also currently operating under the idea that I'm minoring in Math and Astronomy, but that may and will likely change.
See, I'm not really sure which path to take, and while these descriptions aren't accurate, I could go the software engineering route or the web design/development route. At least those are the paths that I think I'd be considering anyway.

The software engineering path would probably entail me taking the third calculus class (though it's not required) so that I could take more upper-level math classes and more difficult CS courses. This would very likely lead to me obtaining a minor in Math and also open the door to a minor in Cybersecurity.

The web design/development route, in my mind, is me taking the easiest courses, probably picking up a minor in Interactive Media and concentrating in internet applications, and simply getting the degree with little trouble so I can get out and do real work on my own. See, I'm a web developer intern right now and I love what I do. I love all the web technologies. But I guess I haven't been exposed to enough software engineering to know if I really love that.

2czw0a,10,2014-08-08,I have some questions that hopefully you guys can help me with.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2czw0a/i_have_some_questions_that_hopefully_you_guys_can/,"Hey /r/engineeringstudents, how is it going? This fall I will be attending a community college taking 14 credit hours; the classes being Cal 1, Gen Chem 1, Arch 1302, and ANTH something. Now I had a lot of questions that  can't really find answers to other than from students themselves with experience. 

As a high school student I took dual credit courses to get some credits out of the way, but unfortunately I did not do so well on some grades resulting in a low GPA (3.43). How can I vastly improve this? My goal is around a 4.0 or higher, honestly is that possible? I know if I'm going to do this I really need to pick up my pace, therefore I decided I was going to study some of my books beforehand and try to improve my study habits. The thing is I don't have experience studying books before hand, how do I do this in an organized manner that will actually help me? 

Regarding studying what useful tips, tricks, habits do you have that you would be willing to share? What sort of advice would you give, all of my classes are in the  morning and the latest last until 2 I believe. Should i study after class, my goals are to get most of the work out of the way , done as best as possible and as quick as possible. Any advice here?

Another goal i have is to get into shape, I've decided on dieting and weight lifting, do you guys suggest just going whenever is best for me? How has it worked out for you guys and gals?

**Lastly is another thing that concerns me, involvement.
**
 Should I get a job? Is that something that you guys were able to handle? If so, what kind of job, I've been advised to stay away from jobs that won't contribute towards my career, but that leaves me with a small amount of options. What  kind of jobs would relate to a mechanical engineering student? In other words what will benefit me for the future regarding to jobs? 

What about internships? I know this is something tat is very useful but how can I find one and get one, when is the time I should do this? What should I look for?  Should I begin something now so it will help me achieve an internship later? If so what would that be, clubs? Volunteering?


Really this is my goal, improve myself overall, from grades, body shape, education, and involvement. This post here is just questioning how to achieve that. Thank you."
2d04j8,0,2014-08-08,Asking for advice and maybe some wisdom? [Long text],ergonomickeyboard,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2d04j8/asking_for_advice_and_maybe_some_wisdom_long_text/,"My situation is kind of pathetic on my part but it's where I am at this point. I am a computer engineering student btw. I need to decide whether I want to try and graduate in May, which may not even be a possibility if I can not schedule all my classes in spring. It would be 7 classes a semester, also including my senior project. My worries about this if I will be able to pass them all, and then with my gpa being a 3.2, If I can pass them all well enough to keep my GPA above a 3.0

My other option is to push a class or two to the fall semester and make sure my grades stay up well enough to keep my GPA above a 3.0 or even go higher. Now I'm sure you're thinking, why doesn't he just try super hard and make it happen? Well there is two sides to that question. The one side is this will be my 5th year, and pushing it another semester would make it 5.5 years which is a little bit embarrassing to say, even though I know many do it. It's embarrassing because it's all my fault, I had a lot of issues in the beginning of college which is why I'm here.

The other part to that question though is that I am not confident at all I'd be able to get a job. I had one internship, the one this summer, and it's not in my field nor really technical which I found out when I started the internship. On top of that I feel like I lack a lot of skills, I'm not very proficient in anything, and I haven't learned much of my major yet and will start this year. Again, I was never one to do projects in my spare time, I feel this major and field is for me but I always would rather play video games on my off time than do projects. I know I'm lazy but that's just how I was, I'm trying to change that now. This is the reasoning behind why I am leaning towards going an extra semester, I feel I really need another internship to give myself a shot at getting a job, and it gives me time to make me more employable because honestly I feel like i'm not at all.

I am sorry for the wall of text, I've talked to a few people but idk I was looking for some advice and ideas from my peers and some graduates. Thank you for reading."

My college major is Management Studies, that's why I was a part of a team which was suppose to optimize AdWords account for clients. My team dealt with Small and Medium Businesses (majorly), Google Grants Accounts and House Ads. 
Even before I joined in, my manager was ready with my internship project. My project was to draw complete flow charts of the optimization process as done by the experts on my team. 
It took me about a month to completely understand how AdWords works and how I should be going about my project. The end motive of my project was to give the flow charts to an engineer so he can code it in a way that most of the work is automated. 
The engineer who was suppose to work on my projects was a little late back so I decided to take up the programming part myself. It took me about 2 weeks to understand the basic functioning of Python and how I can use to make my project a success. 
After about 5 weeks I started coding in Python and started applying the flow charts which I drew for that engineer. 
By the end of my internship (12 weeks) I optimized more than 100 AdWords Campaigns using the tool which I made in Python. 
I presented my project to the director of SMB sales, director of internal tools, for my country and the internal tools director told me that he is Sold and will be taking over my project further to make it big. 
During this time my manager was in Mountain View and he presented my project to two global directors and they wanted to start working on it ASAP. One of the director appointed an engineer then and there to take over my project. They want it to make an internal tool which will be used globally by AdWords account strategist and planners.

The internal tools director for my country has asked me to apply for his team for a full time job after I am done with my graduation. He said that they are bothered about what degree I am pursuing, till the time I can think properly and has the urge to learn, they'd be happy to have me on their team.

Now I am just waiting to graduate and apply again.


I have started learning Python even further and I try to solve every single problem by writing a program. 
I realized that it is not impossible for me just learn coding on my own and be a part of a company like Google. It is completely possible guys, just keep working hard. 

Till date I never posted anything on this subreddit but I used to lurk everyday. Finally I got something significant to post."

Requesting advice from the social security offices has so far ranged from ""You're shit out of luck, get out."" to ""We've never heard of this before, 1/1000 situation. Idk good luck."" The last time my dad went alone they told him that something from a practicing doctor saying I am who I am would be enough but I haven't found anything that says that would work for persons over 18. Does anyone know if this would actually work (I can't get actual medical records made without any kind of medicare, health care or ID as far as I know?) or if theres some alternative I could look at that isn't hiring a lawyer and going through the courts?"

Advice sorely needed.,paffa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2d0nfo/great_schoollonger_time_to_graduate_vs_good/,"**TL;DR Well...there really isn't one.  There are specific circumstances surrounding my problem that I'll need to consider to make the best choice, so I can't shorten this.  If you prefer, you can just comment generally on the topic in the title.  This is something of a novel, so to anyone who reads all of it - thank you!**

I'm trying to choose between two schools to transfer to and to earn my BS.  One of the schools (school A, let's say) is in the top 10 public universities in the US.  Comp sci grads from school A are highly sought by companies, and there is a wealth of research and internship opportunities.  The other school (school B) is a public school as well, and it is a good school, but not nearly as respected and highly ranked.  This school has a significantly greater number of undergrads than the first school (though both would be classified as large schools).  Both schools are in my state and both have roughly the same cost of attendance for in-state students.

With A, I believe there would be stiff competition for transfer admission.  Due to the classes that must be completed prior to transfer to the School of Computer Science, the earliest I'd be able to start attending is Fall 2015.  Then I'd have at least 71 credits to graduation - that's *after* the 30-36 credits I'll be taking over the upcoming fall and spring semesters to get into the school.  So, as of this moment, at least 101 credits to graduation.  Also, even if I aced every class over the next two semesters (which is my goal), I'd earn only about a 3.0 overall GPA. [It's not clear whether school A considers projects, research, and internships in transfer admissions.  I'm trying to determine this ASAP.]

With B, I'm pretty sure I could get in - if not for Spring 2015, then definitely for Fall.  I attended this school for two semesters in the past.  There are no specific requirements for transfer/readmission to the School of Computer Science, and I've already taken nearly every non-major class that is required for the degree.  As of this moment, there are 67 credits to graduation.

I've read often that for computer science, where you get your degree is not as important to employers as projects and demonstrable experience.  However, computer science enrollments are exploding, and while all who enroll don't necessarily graduate, graduate numbers will be increasing significantly, as well.  Perhaps as competition in the market increases, institution reputation/rank will weigh more heavily in hiring decisions.

What do you think?  Will a difficult combination of courses over these next two semesters and a drastic upward trend in performance be enough to overcome a poor GPA and garner acceptance at school A?  Or should I abandon that plan and pursue school B?

It's very important that I decide this right now.  Because the remaining classes for degrees at each school differ so largely (67 vs 101), the classes I'd need to take this semester (starts in a week) also differ significantly.

(Also - I've considered taking CS classes at school B and transferring those to school A.  This is a plan with no guarantees.  Besides two or three classes, none of the classes at B are directly equivalent to A's, so I'd have to get the department to evaluate every class and cross my fingers that they'd accept it, that I would not have wasted my time.

In case anyone thinks it will have an effect - I'm a black female.)"
2d0tv5,9,2014-08-08,My mom is cheating...,tomstaman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2d0tv5/my_mom_is_cheating/,"Hello everyone.

Some background info on me: I'm 16...and yeah, that's all, I guess.

Anyway, a couple months ago I started noticing that my mom started staying in her room with the door closed more often. Being the curious teenager that I am, I tried listening to what she was doing. It was pretty clear that she was on the phone and making very, ahem, sexual noises with someone. I'd knock on her door, and she'd quickly move around and pretend as though nothing had happened. It was pretty obvious though that she had on heavy makeup and was showing 3 inches of cleavage. I put up with it for a couple more months, then got sick of it. I went on a trip to Egypt last winter, and she came along with me. I thought this to be my perfect opportunity. I logged into her Skype account, and ended up finding countless calls and sexual messages to some 23 year old. I screenshotted everything and saved it all. Anyway, the night came where I went and confronted her. I started hinting that I knew something at first, then she was able to tell that I knew. I threatened to tell everyone she knew if she didn't stop. She then broke down and admitted that she was talking to a ""friend"" but swore that all she was doing was talking. She then told me how she was planning on getting a divorce anyway, and that only I knew. Most importantly, she swore never to do anything of this sort again. I felt impossibly confused on the flights back, because I didn't know what to do. My dad is a kind, hardworking man who I honestly believe has never done anything wrong in his life, let alone to my mom. I could either spill the beans and bring justice to my family while ruining my mom's life, or I could keep it in and have something like this burning a hole through my conscience.

Anyway, we're on vacation again (entire family this time), and I've noticed that she seems to ""go to work"" very often (she has an internship here). Often times she'll say she's coming back at 4, then come back at 6. Even more often is when she'll receive a phone call and immediately go into a room alone and talk for hours. My dad is the smartest man I know, but he doesn't suspect anything foul going on. I've honestly had it with this woman that I'm forced to call my mother. My dad works his ass off for my family and especially my mom, and my unemployed, lazy, useless mother uses the money he earns to buy gifts for her lover.

I've been mulling this whole situation for several days now, and I don't know what to do. I have access to her email, Facebook, Skype, etc, and I have countless pieces of proof showing that she is a disgusting and pathetic excuse of a cheater.

What should I do? Thank you for helping me, and for leading this long post.


**Edit:** I have to say, I didn't expect nearly as many responses to this post. You guys have blown me away with how helpful you all are. If I could gild you all, I swear I would. It's around 3 in the morning here, so I'm going to bed. I'm going to think everything over for the next few days, then talk to my mom about it and make her confess to my dad. Regardless of whether she agrees or not, I'm going to let my dad make the final decisions, because you guys have firmly convinced me that the choice is his.

Thank you all once again. I knew I could count on you, reddit. "
2d0x18,2,2014-08-08,"Arizona subtenancy, drugs, and a pissed off ""landlord""",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2d0x18/arizona_subtenancy_drugs_and_a_pissed_off_landlord/,"To preface this, I do have a lawyer (best boyfriend ever!) but he just recently passed the bar and hasn't had much experience practicing.

This summer I decided to move down to Tempe (mistake #1) to work as an engineering intern for a copper mine. The mine is fantastic, but the living situation not so much. I used padmapper to find a place shortly before I left, chatting with the guy I was subletting from to make sure everything was in order. I was told my roommate was a quiet guy who kept mostly to himself, figured it would work so I sent him an electronic copy of the signed agreement.

The first night in AZ there was a bit of a hiccup. I was slated to move in May 22nd, but the guy I was subletting from couldn't meet up with me to get me keys because he couldn't miss his workout. Ok then, thankfully my boyfriends family live in the area so I went and crashed at their place. The 23rd rolls around and he asks if 7pm is an ok time to meet up. No. No it is not, I have shit to move in and an air mattress to blow up. We meet up at 7pm anyways. Whatever, have keys. Was informed at that point that my roommate ""occasionally"" smoke weed (even though in the agreement I signed it states no smoking is allowed in the building, mistake #2). 

I open the door to the place and the smell of weed is thick. Not only is weed permeating every surface in this place, there are moldy dishes in the sink, food is literally rotting in the garbage, there is a thawed chicken covered with maggots on the porch, and a shit stain around the entirety of the toilet. Yay, the place looks nothing like the pictures. I spent 3 days cleaning the place, making sure to take before pictures so nothing would come out of my security deposit.

To cut a long story short, this place was a nightmare. My roommate smokes weed every day, I have seen drug deals go down, parties happen at least 4 times a week (two being on weeknights, when I have to be up at 4am), dishes continue to rot (that is until he threw them all away because I asked him to do his dishes), the management has left 10 day notices on our door for possible eviction due to disturbing the peace, and I have heard stories of my roommate getting mad and throwing stuff at walls (which has left dents at least 1/3"" deep). On top of that I found out the guy I am subletting from is charging me a higher monthly rent than he pays the landlord, by about an additional $70/month.

I contacted the guy I'm subletting from to let him know this place isn't working out. If I test positive for drugs during my internship I am so fucking fucked it isn't funny, which screws over my future career. The subletter contacted my roommate and things got better for awhile, but then they got worse. After one particular bad night of partying and smoking I packed up my shit, moved into a new place, and blocked the subletters and roommates numbers (mistake #3).

Now to present. Today my mother received a letter in the mail from the subletter, since he did not have my forwarding address, stating within 90 he will begin legal process to 1) create a bad debt on my credit account with all three credit bureaus and 2) proceed with either a collection agency or a notification to small claims court in Arizona for unpaid rent of July and August. So, is he just bullshitting me to get 2 months worth of rent out of me? I could scrape together the money, but it's more the principal as he deliberately lied to me and placed me in an unsafe situation. What legal ground do I have to deal with this guy? I know in most states it is illegal for tenants to profit off of a landlords property, but I'm not sure if that is the case here, or if it would even help me."

The title is pretty self-explanatory, but I think it won't hurt to provide some additional details.

I am from Russia, and I believe many of you are well aware about current situation here. It's not that bad at the moment, but I'm afraid that things are about to worsen in the nearest future. All I need is a quiet place to live and enough money to have a roof over my head and something to eat.

I've finished my degree this summer (a month ago), and now I'm in the process of getting all the papers required to leave my country. However, I'm neither from Moscow, nor from St.Petersburg and my Uni won't ring any bell.

My preferred programming languages are Python and JavaScript (and preferred field, as you might have guessed, is web development). And I would be glad to pick another language as well. I have a couple of projects (pretty simple though), a number of contributions on GitHub and an internship at the local company under my belt. I am proficient with math, well aware about stackoverflow / google, not afraid of documentation and reading the source code, and doing my best to stay up-to-date with modern technologies and libraries.

I hope this is enough for starters, but all the questions are more than welcome.

Given all that, what could you suggest me to do to increase my chances to leave Russia and to move to Europe / US / Canada / Australia / New Zealand (I wouldn't mind to move to another country as well, but I'd prefer English-speaking one)?

Thank you all."

2d1n6p,325,2014-08-09,For all you 4.0 obsessed kids coming into engineering and willing to do anything to get it. Take it from one of your (former) own. You are going down a very bad path.,Moraloftheengineer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2d1n6p/for_all_you_40_obsessed_kids_coming_into/,"I was once like you. An eager, driven, willing to sacrifice anything for success(grades) kid. I bought the textbooks and pre-read them over the summer. I earned a 95% percentile SAT score. 

I executed freshman year like you plan to. I did my homework, I hogged office hours even though I didn't really need them, I made sure to be the first to class to ask questions, I made sure that I did everything right in terms of academics. I didn't use too many study drugs. My life consisted of school, study, and sleep. I didn't have friends and I didn't even know the names of 20 fellow students. I did get a lab position during the school year (grunts/drones that only work are great for unpaid labour processing raw data) Yes, I did get a 4.0 my first year, and even got an internship in oil and gas. In my class there were four other people like myself who did the exact same thing. 

^^ Sounds great right? Exactly what you want at a price you are quite happy to pay? Just give you the strategy/formula and you will be on your way? 

During my internship with an oil and gas company, I performed exceptionally well. My presentations and assignments were always complemented. My technical knowledge was ""far beyond a typical freshman."" I put in 12-16 hour days. I came in on weekends when the janitors were the only other people there. I thought that everything was going well. Until it came to the last day, when we got a review from our mentor, the group supervisor, and the intern manager. I was told in no uncertain terms that while I was excellent at what I did, I was bad for morale and created a toxic environment of unreasonable standards (they weren't happy about the weekend stuff). They also felt that my pace was unsustainable and unhealthy (I gained some 40 pounds over the course of that year, so they were right about that) and were reluctant to invest in someone who probably would be destroyed by the end of third year. They told me to reapply if my GPA fell below 3.8 or I could provide some other evidence that I relaxed. I did what many of you would have done. I completely blew up on them, accusing them of ""trying to engineer a culture of mediocrity."" Needless to say I have never returned and I burned a lot of bridges doing that. 

I left my internship exhausted and returned to my college. Only three of the first year students with 4.0 or near 4.0 returned. One dropped out as he was tired of hating life and unfortunately took to alcohol. The other transferred to bioscience with the goal of becoming a doctor after again, a failed internship (similar reasons + he openly battled with his team members). 

I (like you probably are) was very sensitive to criticism. I saw the solution as being even more high achieving. I entered contest after contest. Drove myself to not just get a 4.0, but be ranked 1 in the class (other two 4.0s had a higher percent average and therefore beat me in rank). Joined a political campaign. Joined the most successful engineering team at my school. Racked up a list of stuff for my resume. Got another internship, this time with an aerospace firm. 

They had a welcome party for the 15 of us and I felt incredibly out of place. That held for the entire internship. Still performed well, but one can only operate in an environment where everyone dislikes you for so long. I didn't realize how much of a mental bottle I had built to contain my feelings and emotions in an effort to maintain that ""computer data driven monotone thinking."" The thing that set me off was Facebook pictures of the second party (I skipped it).  I realized the frustration and anger that had quietly built up within myself. All those people did shit compared to what I did and what I achieved (as least as I saw it then. Can't remember objectively), yet they were at the same place I was and enjoying their lives. I hated every second of everything I did in the hope that I could get another position where I would have the exact same existence. My body and mind were breaking down, and I knew that there are limited ways to extend mental capability. I got to the point of seriously contemplating suicide as the ""mission objectives"" seemed pointless as they would just lead to a reset of the objectives. Basically they get reset, but I wouldn't. 

I drifted in this void until October while I tried to re-assemble my mental barriers and return to my usual state (you are not a Vulcan. You can't prevent the emotional bottle from cracking over time.) I got some help when one of my profs realized where I was and intervened. 

After that point, I took life a lot less seriously. I still got top grades (3.7 for the year), but I tried to make friends. I never got to the point where is socially capable like most, but have yet to get a performance review that says I am toxic again. I saw no negative effects for my ""deprioritization"" My peers with 3.5s and up got equal or better offers to mine and they are climbing up or jumping to other fields just as rapidly and successfully. Drive is good, but after a point it stops being drive and becomes self destructive obsession. Of the five 4.0s in first year, Only two graduated in engineering. Two went to med school for reasons of financial security (fear) and one dropped out and last I heard, didn't go anywhere. 


TDLR: You gain nothing from getting that 4.0 at all costs beyond a obsessive perfectionist complex, a fragile mental state, and a spot on a wobbly tower beside a cliff that could come crashing over with a single negative event. Your top classmates will get to the same place with less effort, more fun and with fewer mental issues. You will have time to enjoy the other things that make life great. Friends, family,parties,  hot guys ect. You gather data and make decisions based on it. You run your lives off what you learn from others. Do your analysis and make sure you don't make a catastrophic mistake chasing your definition of perfection.

I currently work. I want to work somewhere more IT related instead of flipping burgers. I talked with the processors and was told internship would be available until my sophomore-junior year
2d1zbt,1,2014-08-09,To apply or not to apply?,multiplelamps,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2d1zbt/to_apply_or_not_to_apply/,"I've found an online job posting for a production intern position at a pretty well known media company that I would LOVE to work for.

However, the listing is from March and I'm not sure if they've forgotten to take it down, if they're still looking, or there's some other reason. 

Problem is, I'm starting my next semester in two weeks and I have a potential job lined up recording videos for my university and I'm not sure whether I should risk not accepting it just to apply for this internship that might not even be a thing anymore.

I would so rather intern but if for some reason they get back to me by the time I've already said yes to the other job, I don't want to ruin any future chances working with them.

I cooould wait until next semester to apply for this internship...if it's somehow still listed, but that's not a guarantee and I don't know if there's a polite way to approach the company to find out more information.

Thanks!"
2d2gng,0,2014-08-09,"So two days ago, I graduated from college with a batchlor's in biology. I have some questions about job searching and life after graduation.",ofom,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2d2gng/so_two_days_ago_i_graduated_from_college_with_a/,"So first of all, my resume is solid.  I'm a bio major looking to get into research or do bench work in a lab.  I had an internship this past summer, have taken some good laboratory classes.  I wish my GPA was higher and I regret a lot of stuff I did in college but I think a 3.0 is survivable.  

What scares me now are references.  I have pretty much none at the moment and I have questions about that.

A)  I'm totally new to this whole job search thing.  How important are references?  Where do they come into play when getting hired?  When you ask someone to be a reference for you, what do you say?

B) In regards to my internship, I have my lab supervisor's e-mail.  The last time she e-mailed me was in December.  I e-mailed her again in May to touch base and she never replied.  I will e-mail again If I do, then it will be 8 months since we were last in touch. Any advice on what I should say?

C)  As for my lab classes, I learned a lot of my lab skills from 2 courses.  I hate to say this, I'm not sure I my professors would want to recommend me.  I did the work and I learned a lot but in one class I got a C+ and in the other class, I didn't turn in the only graded assignment, a final paper (I got a B in that class anyway since I showed up to almost every lab and learned the techniques.).  There is one other class, a Research Literature class, that I'm also mentioning in my resume that I got an A in but it's not as important.

Given this, I can't really say that I stood out in my classes.  Now, the lab skills I learned from these classes form a **major** part of my resume.  Do I ask my professors for references (heck, is that even appropriate?), and if so, how do I go about doing so?

D)  Worst case senario, no one wants to serve as a reference for me.  What then?  How do I present that to my employers?  How to get new references?

------------------------------------------------

Whew!  Next, I'm worried about retaining my skills and knowledge.  To have good lab skills, like precision of measurement and attention to detail, and knowledge of specific techniques, you need practice.  Also, I'm not going to be in school anymore so I'm losing knowledge.

There are some ways I can compensate.  I've downloaded a ton of papers from Nature that I'm going to read, there are my old textbooks, and cooking involves attention to detail and such that (OK, very vaguely) resembles lab work.

How do I retain my skills as I look for jobs?

Anyone have any advice on classes I can take or certifications I can acquire (I have a few thousand dollars from my parents and jobs and stuff)?  

Basically, how do I improve my employability while I am unemployed.

--------------------------

Alright, that pretty much sums up my life for the past few days.  If you're reading this, thank you for enduring my word spew.

One last question:  I'm totally new to this college grad thing and unemployment thing.  Is there anything else I should know?  Any last bit of advice you can give me?

Thank you in advance!"
2d2k43,1,2014-08-09,transitioning from paid intern to position at a non-profit. Guidance needed!,pnogood,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2d2k43/transitioning_from_paid_intern_to_position_at_a/,"I’m looking for some advice/opinion regarding my move from a paid internship to a position in a non-profit.

I’ve been working as a paid intern with a very small non-profit since January. We are a team of only one full time staff person, one two day a week staff person, and two interns including myself. Since my internship began I’ve become, understandably, quite instrumental in our tiny office. We lack an ED so I often take on big projects like guiding programming, giving presentations to large potential sponsors, and writing external documents like annual reports. 

I have an opportunity to go back to school in September (which I don’t really want to do), and I’ve asked my organization to make me a job offer (as they’ve expressed interest in having me stay on) so I can decide whether its best for me to stay in my non-profit or return to school. While previously my supervisor had commiserated that I was underpaid, and later that she planned to pay me more than my modest intern pay when I asked her a couple of weeks ago about a formal job offer she changed her tone a bit and suggested that I might have to wait until January to see a pay increase.

I’m currently being paid about 50% of what others in my city and in my job title are making. And quite frankly, not really enough to support myself adequately in the city I live. I’m concerned that when my job offer comes in a few days there will not be any increase in compensation and I’ll be forced to make a tough choice. 

I’m just not sure what to do.   
a.	Take the job offer and try to find other work  
b.	Try to negotiate for a higher fee and leave if they are unable to meet my expectation  
c.	Go back to school

Thanks for your input!

The title is pretty self-explanatory, but I think it won't hurt to provide some additional details.

I am from Russia, and I believe many of you are well aware about current situation here. It's not that bad at the moment, but I'm afraid that things are about to worsen in the nearest future. All I need is a quiet place to live and enough money to have a roof over my head and something to eat.

I've finished my degree this summer (a month ago), and now I'm in the process of getting all the papers required to leave my country. However, I'm neither from Moscow, nor from St.Petersburg and my Uni won't ring any bell.

My preferred programming languages are Python and JavaScript (and preferred field, as you might have guessed, is web development). And I would be glad to pick another language as well. I have a couple of projects (pretty simple though), a number of contributions on GitHub and an internship at the local company under my belt. I am proficient with math, well aware about stackoverflow / google, not afraid of documentation and reading the source code, and doing my best to stay up-to-date with modern technologies and libraries.

I hope this is enough for starters, but all the questions are more than welcome.

Given all that, what could you suggest me to do to increase my chances to leave Russia and to move to Europe / US / Canada / Australia / New Zealand (I wouldn't mind to move to another country as well, but I'd prefer English-speaking one)?

Thank you all."

2d3xq4,11,2014-08-09,"University or self-learning? I'm at a bit of a crossroad, mature student.",y45y564,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2d3xq4/university_or_selflearning_im_at_a_bit_of_a/,"Hi - I'm 28, currently back at the folks in order to reformat my brain with stuff I can use. I'm in the UK. 

I'm interested and enjoying learning CS, and things around it, though there's a tonne to learn. I'm working towards being at Higher GCSE, then I intend to move on and do my A Level (same as AP in US I think) 

I couldn't get into Uni directly - as I didn't have enough qualifications I need to do something called an Access course for a year, that will then enable me to move onto University. 

So the Access course is a Year, then the Uni course is like 4 years I guess (sandwich year, most take them though, 3 years without). So that's 5 years, which puts me at 33 finish time. 

What I'm wondering though is how important University really is, and If I'm wondering this now how important is it going to be in 5 years time? Moocs / Khan / Edx etc are increasingly offering better learning opportunities to those outside academia. 

My background has been in music, for various reasons this isn't really an option any more. But I'm still a creative person, and the idea of creating things really appeals to me about programming, the possibilities to make things with it are very exciting to me. Having made music for a long time I've got a pretty good understanding of learning process for things, and all the unseen that goes around an end product. ( I don't expect to get offered a red or a blue pill by some dude in a trench coat after playing around with scratch....) 

I'm yet to find my niche, or buzz within programming, I'm still new to it though, and there's more than enough fundamentals for me to work through. 

I have patient parents, not sure if supportive is the right word. But patient and not-going-to-boot-me-out would cover it. So self learning is a serious option, for how long I'm not too sure... piece of string question really. The sooner I was able to show them some kind of money though the better they would feel. Maybe a couple of years could be done if there's progress being made though. 

Uni appeals to me because I think that maybe I'll get a more holistic understanding, and be exposed to areas and options that I wouldn't be otherwise. 

Self learning appeals to me because I think I might be able to accelerate better, and once I find a core interest apply myself fully to it. Theres also the flexibility of spending more time on a project, and then maybe internship or something a bit down the road. 

I'm really curious to hear some thoughts though. I don't really have anyone with experience to bounce these kinds of ideas off, so It's valuable to hear from those that do. I've got an interview for the Access course next week (where they are offering me a place I think, that's what was implied at least), but I'm not too sure how I feel at the moment. 

If there's any information I've missed then I'll add it, I think that covers it though.

[I have a bit of an odd question, and I know I'm pretty late to this but figured I would try anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm7bwa?context=5)|Never too late, I opened this up for another day for availability so that it can reach more people!
[My question is this: is there a pharmaceutical product available that could synthesize that effect by doing similar things in the brain? I realize you're a therapist and not a psychiatrist, but I'm hoping you'll have some knowledge of medications anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm7bwa?context=5)|I wish I could offer more support as far as medications go. I have seen a lot of progress with people that use xanex, in the appropriate dosage. But the problem with xanex is that is habit forming and can lead to addiction to it. I have also seen a lot of positives with medical marijuana, which may be more up your ally if you had a decent LSD experience. It will calm you down and mellow you out for a little bit. Although I warn that every substances effects everyone differently. What works for Tom won't necessarily work for Sally. That is my problem with suggesting medications. I learned this first hand when I decided to try a chemotherapy medication for my disease, which was told to me to have helped many women. The medication ended up making me really sick and I still struggle with problems due to that medication. Since going through that, it gave me a perspective of what it is like for some people who try meds that seemingly help one person but have a completely different effect on yourself. When it comes to meds, you especially psych meds, it's a lot of trial and error. They try this, see if this works, tweak it's levels, ween off, try another, tweak levels, see progress, watch progress continue, see if can maintain longterm stability, etc etc. Open up your mind to the possibility of trying again, knowing it may take a moment to figure out what works and what doesn't. Keep a list of what doesn't and list as an allergy.
[Thank you so much for your reply! I really appreciate it, as well as the tips, and I'll try to put them to good use.  Follow-up question, though: legal issues aside, could you tell me how dangerous would it be for me to regularly take LSD at a small dose (like the first one\), maybe every few days/once a week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm7uyd?context=5)|It could potentially be dangerous and make mental illness worse if done too frequently, so be careful!
[Are there ever times where it's really difficult to diagnose someone? Like you know something is obviously wrong but you can't figure out what it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlwvvw?context=5)|Sometimes it is a challenge. Since I only have my masters I can diagnose, but only in the general area of the actual diagnosis (for example, 311.00-Depressive disorder NOS, 300.00 Anxiety disorder NOS, 296.90, Mood disorder NOS--DSM IV) I diagnose you anyway. :-X I currently have 20 clients that I have seeing our psychiatrist, and of those 20, I have correctly figured out the diagnosis of 19 of them. I have a good track record. It's about picking up the pieces of the puzzle and ruling out other disorders.
 |I guess I should add, when I say I diagnose you anyway, is because I'm geeky and I loved learning about the DSM. I enjoy taking the pieces of someone's puzzle and figuring out what is wrong. Sometimes it takes a while to see our doctor and if I don't have a good idea of what is going on with the client, it won't allow me to progress with that client until I figure out the root of the problem, so I try to figure out what the diagnosis is so that I can start using therapy that is more effective for that kind of person than string them along with things that may not work.
[Are you limited by your place of work?  I'm an LMSW and can diagnose anything as long as it meets criteria. I'm not limited to ""general"" diagnoses like NOS dx. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjmfvz9?context=5)|My agency limits me until I have my license. I could make more defined diagnosis if I want to but my supervisor tells me I don't have the credentials to. I hope to move on career wise, someday soon.
[I've read the DSM plenty of times, but can you explain to me the basic differences between Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlzq18?context=5)|Bipolar one: leans more towards manic episodes/being 'up' a lot. bipolar two: leans more towards depressive side.
[Do you ever worry about certain clients outside of their appointment time with you? If you have to break confidentiality how does it work? Do you go with them to the hospital?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm0m63?context=5)|1) There are some that I worry about in my free time. This might make me a bad therapist. I do separate work from personal life, but there are the key few really struggling that cause me to do a lot of 'work' from home. This means keeping up to date with therapy, different suggestions and routes to go, and even reading reedits of people going through the actual problem.
 |2) The only ways I can break confidentiality is if:    *They provide a specific consent allowing me to discussion specific (and has to be detailed) information.    *They are a harm to themselves or others.    *In educational purposes where I leave out defining information that is related to anything that could identify the client.
 |3) If they wanted me to, I would! This is not something I have been asked to do yet. I have had to call an ambulance before, I have told them to go and had them call me once they have gotten there, but I have no yet been asked to go with to the hospital. Being seen out in public is technically a break of a clients confidentiality, buttt if I had to, I would.
[Thank you for all the detailed responses you are giving in this ama!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm0w4y?context=5)|You're welcome :-D My partner works until 2am or so and I was bored and doing nothing with my night, so it was actually really enjoyable to do! 
[I'm currently a bio major who's going through the ""I don't know if I want to continue this"" phase. So, I've been looking at psychology for some time, and perhaps going into a field in abnormal psych. So, my question is, what made you want to become a mental health therapist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlzyg8?context=5)|I, at one point, was an education major. I had taken a sociology of education class and it really disenchanted me with the major. The root of the problem was that I discovered that by being a teacher I would not be helping anyone. I looked into helping careers and landed on the social work major. I never knew I was so passionate until I started taking classes.
 |I came into mental health by accident, actually. I initially intended to go into domestic violence and rape advocacy, or LGBTQIA advocacy. My graduate school internship was as a drug and alcohol therapist. After a while of working in this, I came across a lot of people with mental health problems. This triggered a lot of research (on my part, to help them best). When my internship hired me on, they had asked me to work in mental health. I am one of 2 main mental health therapists for my clinic right now. The more I do it the more I gain passion for it. Will I do it forever? I want to, but my ultimate goal is to become a professor (when I am old and grey). So we will see.
[Hello and thanks a lot for doing this AMA! I really appreciate therapy and I think your job is important to people who need to vocalize their problems or just have some one to talk to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm368q?context=5)|And you are welcome! Thank you for appreciating what I do! It only confirms that doing AMA's like this every once and a while is a good thing :-D I know lots of people need advice and help and they are in many different situations where it is not possible. I like to help put a step in the right direction! This is why I do what I do :-D.
[Anyway, I was recently told i had very standard clincal/major depression, and was put on lexapro for a while, but with being kind of a poor college student, I couldn't really continue therapy or medication. That being said, I found that it didn't really make me feel all that different, and I would still generally feel bad throughout the day, and was actually feeling worse and ended up self-harming again (which i regrettably did not tell my psychiatrist at the time\). I'm now at a pretty neutral state where I acknowledge my depression, but don't really feel the motivation/energy to do something about it, or anything in general for that matter. I don't really know how to phrase my question, but I guess in short, what do you think I can do to raise my motivation and help myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjm368q?context=5)|If you do this each time you are triggered it will do a couple big things: One, it will tell you what you're main triggers are (and you can learn how you want to start confronting or avoiding this trigger!), it will tell you how often you are being triggered (what was so different about Monday that you were triggered 10 times, but on Tuesday you were only triggered 3?), and it will help remove the negative thought from your head, where it will only build and consume.
[Hello Jamie!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlypbt?context=5)|Thank you! I agree, mental health issues are a serious problem and the fact that it is made to be closeted makes it a bigger deal.
[My question is though, do you see the mental health field showing any signs of increase for those who are incarcerated? It seems like the issue of mental health in prisons/jails are a major topic, but it doesn't seem like much progress is being made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlypbt?context=5)|That being said, not all prisons offer treatment or adequate care.
[Also, what suggestions do you have for someone looking to get in that field of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlypbt?context=5)|If you are going into that field of work, I say keep an open mind. No matter who you work with or what they have done, they deserve help. 
[Do you treat a lot of bipolar patients? What makes them high risk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlx0tt?context=5)|I have worked with MANY bipolar clients, but to be fair I have found that bipolar has become a 'throw away diagnosis' for clients who have doctors that are too lazy to investigate further. Bipolar clients are usually high risk when they have a significant number of stressors in their life. This is when I pay a lot more attention to the client and do check ups throughout the week.
[Have you ever been threatened by a patient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlx0tt?context=5)|So far I have never been threatened by a client! My track record is good and I have been safe. I have worked with people with histories of being violent. The key is to stay comfortable with everyone and no one will try to hurt you.
[What winds up being the real diagnosis for people mis-diagnosed with bipolar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlxdql?context=5)|A number of different things. From PTSD, to manic depressive disorder. 
[Ummm, manic depressive disorder is the old, out-dated name for Bipolar. Same thing/same criteria. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d48db/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cjlz7jb?context=5)|It has some differences, but you are right, very similar.

2d4vnu,1,2014-08-10,Uncertain about school/degree for Bachelors.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2d4vnu/uncertain_about_schooldegree_for_bachelors/,"Wall of text inc.

TL;DR - Hacking nerd in HS, did some pentests for IT-Net class, really loved it  

- Likes programming/app dev, and would love to learn more about it.
- Met w/ industry pros and they all tell me different degree options
- Ideally I'd love to mix the two. 
- Paying everything myself out of pocket, so school price is a factor as well. 
- What do?


Currently i'm enrolled in a Community College as a CS major. Originally, I went to and graduated from a Vo-Tech program for IT-Networking, and while it was interesting, I fell in love with Security! When choosing a major my options were CS or IT( for Associates ). I figured CompSci would be the better fit because most Associate programs focus more on the business side rather than the technical. Since then i've dabbled more into programming, and it really interests me, especially mobile development(Android). 


I was lucky enough to take a visit to my company's corporate HQ and sit down with the CIO, and members of each team: IT, Datacenter, Security, Mobile App, and Marketing tech. This really opened my eyes to the realities of each job, and role. As expected the Security team ,and the App team really stood out. To sum it up:

* Security team really made it a point, if you want to get into security get an InfoSec degree w/an 
internship as opposed to a CS degree
* App team wasn't really too picky on degree's, the Project Lead has no degree, but she informed me that my initial choice doesn't stand out as a tech school, and she's right about that. 
* The CIO didn't care about what school or my major was, she stated that all that mattered was obtaining a Bachelors and showing competency in your profession. She elaborated more on on what degree's meant not to just her, but to the industry as a whole. Her driving point was that there are many companies that refuse to promote and raise an employee due to education level, and my company was one of them. 
 

As for schools, [this](http://www.mc3.edu/academics/areas-of-study/stem/computer-science/computer-science-as) is my CC and [these](http://www.mc3.edu/academics/courses/1063-cis) are my options for the two electives my major offers. 

[School one](http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/) is West Chester as a CS Major. 
Pros:    

* Really cheap school, great for a guy w/ no money. I could walk away with less than 20k debt.
* Program has a concentration/cert in [Security](http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/isc/curricula.html) which is NSA approved, if that means anything. 
* Attenuation agreement, all credits x-fer.
* 31 miles away, so commuting is possible.
* If I obtain a scholarship at CC, they follow me to West Chester.

Cons:    

* This was the school the Mobile App lead was referring too. 
* Other schools like Drexel, Upenn, and Penn State have better recruiting options and will overshadow me. 
* No formal security degree. 

[School Two](http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/programs/baccalaureate/S/SRA) is Penn State Berks as an InfoSec Major (SRA)
Pros:  

* Company Security Team spoke highly of Penn State.
* Awesome recruiting opportunities.
* National recognition. 
* Short commute 

Cons:  

* Unsure if all credits x-fer
* Moderately expensive
* No CS program / only prog courses I get exposed to are from CC.

[School Three](http://www.drexel.edu/mccc/academics/overview/computing-security-technology/) is Drexel @MC3 as an Info Sec Major (Computing &amp; Sec Tech) 
Pros:  

* Security team spoke highly of Drexel
* Decent recruiting options
* Long drive but can commute
* All credits X-fer 
* CO-OP is built into the program, and usually well paying. I should note that Drexel has one of the best CO-OP programs in the country. 

Cons:  

* **EXPENSIVE** like no other
* No CS program / only prog courses I get exposed to are from CC.

I should note, one of the Security team members was a recent grad (2013) from an online degree program. I've pondered that idea in the past since they can be really cheap and flexiable. [WGU](http://www.wgu.edu) would be my choice if shit happens and I needed to have greater flexibility. 

Im sure a lot of you have pondered the same sort of problem, I like two things and wanna prepare for both! Any feedback would be helpful.

2d4wk6,1,2014-08-10,Currently finishing a summer internship. Was offered a full-time position at another company that wants me to start next week. Advice on how I handle this?,leftleftleftleft,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2d4wk6/currently_finishing_a_summer_internship_was/,"I have 3 more weeks left to go in an internship.  I have not been approached or heard through the grapevine that the company is interested in me as a full-time employee at the end of summer or that it even has a position to fill.  I love the company and team and would welcome continuing to work there full-time (with a salary, of course).

Last week I was contacted by another company; it is not a direct competitor but does similar work.  I went in for an interview and they said they loved me and want me to start next week.  

The issues I have are that the position is not an engineering one but a technician position and I feel uneasy not giving a two-week notice to my current company and burning bridges.  The tech position pay is completely below what I thought I would be earning out of school with an engineering degree.  I am interested in the work I would be doing at the new company and I would have work experience in my field but again the pay is low.  

I figure these are my options:

1.  Accept low-paying technician offer.  I would burn bridges with engineering company but I would be employed full-time with benefits while I look for an engineering job.

2.  Reject low-paying job in the hopes current company comes around and offers me an engineering position, or at the very least will act as a source of great references when looking for new position.

3.  Ask low-paying company to wait until end of internship.  I have stalled them for a bit but they're going to need a yes or a no soon.  If I say yes but ask to please wait until the end of the internship, what happens if I get an offer from my current company or another one?  What do I say to tech position company--thanks but no thanks afterall?

4.  Approach current company about job offer from another company with vague details and walk the fine line between an ultimatum ""Give me a job or I walk"" and the indirect ""Hey I got a job offer.  Isn't that neat?  I'm going to need to leave soon, I guess, unless you guys have something to say...""

I would appreciate any advice. "
2d5zbi,1,2014-08-10,"Thinking of leaving my current internship as soon as I can find a good replacement, can I get some advice?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2d5zbi/thinking_of_leaving_my_current_internship_as_soon/,"I know there is a /r/internships subreddit but it is very inactive and I think I would get a much more relevant response here for my question.

I am a third year computer science student. For the past 8 months, I have been working as an intern at a start up in Southern California. I would say our company is pretty well established now. We will be celebrating our first year in November. Although I am technically an intern, I have been doing work all over the place for the company. Backend development for the main system, generating reports, as well as writing technical documentation for our API's. I am glad I am not running around filling spreadsheets or doing coffee runs all day long.

Our office, which is also headquarters, has a dev team of 5 people. Lead developer with a master's degree, one guy with a bachelors, and three interns (including myself). Us three interns definitely are involved in the main development of our company as much as the other fellas. Although I am perfectly satisfied with this experience, we interns are paid only $12 per hour. 

I have learned a lot from this internship for the past 8 months than I have in school. However, the pay is way too low. This internship is my main source of income right now. As a college student who pays rent, books, food, bills, and car, ~30 hours a week at $12/hour while still attending school is not allowing me to save much money. I have other friends who are at internships with big corporate companies making around $20 an hour at their internships and they don't do as much work as we do. I would definitely like to be making more money right now to continue to pad my savings account early. 

I have been considering applying to other internships in my area that would pay more and hopefully making the leap to a new company. The main drawback of doing this is that I am now very involved in my current company and I would like to continue to contribute to the company's growth. I see confidence in my company's growth and success. I also see potential of being hired full time after I graduate in June 2015. Job security is very important to me.

On the plus side, the other two interns at my company depend on me for rides to work. If I was to leave my company, the other two interns (which are good friends of mine), have told me they would leave the company as well. I do have this as leverage to my CEO should I decide to negotiate my pay (my CEO would be the person to talk to in this case as my office is very small and slightly micromanaged).


I have split my options up as such:
 1) Talk to CEO and ask for a raise or else I will have to leave to a new company (I will do this once I can have one or two job offers from other companies)
 2) Apply to other companies and jump ship ASAP"

I'm a college student going into his senior year. I'm president of more than a few organizations within the University, and I'm a member of our SGA group. Overall I have a lot of on campus involvement.  


Things have been rough for me in the past. I was orphaned almost my whole life, and have no relationship with my actual parents. I was over weight, poor, and unpopular in high school. This lead to a ton of bullying up until my senior year when I was actually able to prove people wrong. During my high school days I contemplated suicide a lot, and even had a botched attempt when my roommate walked in on me as I was about to commit the act.


College on the other hand has been pretty great. I have a pretty good GPA, I'm heavily involved on campus, and I've done a couple of internships. This summer however has been absolutely awful. 

I received a paid internship at a CPA office in my town and that job was supposed to get me through the summer. However, I lost that job when the CPA office had a mass exodus during my second week. A lot of people leaving, and the office eventually going out of business left me without a job.


This was really difficult on me. They told me not to get another job just yet, and that everything would be panned out. It obviously wasn't. My rent and car payment were approaching their due date so I had to pawn a lot of my items and I do mean a lot just to make the payments so that I could function.


I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills. After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again.


This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk.


Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it. I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

* Windows desktop app for downloading songs/albums from Youtube
* Somewhat popular github project that acts like an api for a relatively well-known website
* Partially completed C++ chess engine (implements most rules and can solve
complicated tactical puzzles but currently lacks any sort of interface support)
* Django app that calculates numbers represented as words, ie input of
""seventhousand and twelve divided by 2"" will display 3506
* High-level library for a component of an office software suite (Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, etc.)

The second project in the list is the most popular one. The chess engine seems like it would be the most impressive project on paper and would be fun to talk about in an interview, although my C++ isn't as strong as my Python and it shows. The last project probably contains the highest quality code, although it's not particularly popular and I'm worried that the subject material might be a bit dry.

2d70bu,2,2014-08-10,Advice on continuing to PhD or leaving after MS,curiousgradstudent,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2d70bu/advice_on_continuing_to_phd_or_leaving_after_ms/,"I recently finished my MS requirements (engineering) and am trying to decide if I should stay for PhD at my current institution (ranked #1 or 2 for my discipline if anyone cares). 

My potential adviser and I do not seem to be able to communicate effectively, which is a first for me. This seems like it could make for a potentially very stressful few years. It also sounds like my summer employer might be able to hire me full time (although won't know for several more weeks). Also the student funding situation in my department sucks as we are graduate only, so there are very few TA jobs, and prof's won't fund you until you do research for them full-time for 1-2 quarters. I'm guessing that since they are such a prestigious school, they can get away with this as there will always be more students, several of which undoubtedly have their own funding (NSF pls give your runner ups money =( ). As it stands, I'd have to rely on getting TAships until next year, and this is extremely unlikely as there are so few positions.

As I see it, I have a few options:

* Continue and do PhD at current school, likely having to pay for some/all of the upcoming year before landing a paid RA position. I'm very lucky in that I can afford to do this without too much of a problem, but it just seems fucked up to me. Friends of mine at equally prestigious universities don't seem to know anyone who can't at least get a TA job consistently until they get on a grant. 

* Industry full time.

* Transfer to different university, and find a job for a year or so during the down time between schools.

* Industry for a couple years and then consider re-applying to PhD programs. I'm a bit concerned with this option as life happens, and it seems like it could become financially difficult to go back in two or three years.

Anything I'm missing here? Any thoughts?

Some other stuff to consider (incoming rant):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I took, and failed PhD qualifying exams. I can take them once more, and I think I'd probably pass them this time. It sounded like I was borderline last time, and having an idea of what to expect and how I'm actually being evaluated is a big help.

2. What I am really interested in working on does seem to be pretty specific and doesn't seem to be widely researched at many schools.

3. There are 3 main labs that do research in my area in my department. I worked in one for a couple quarters and found it a bit too theoretical for my tastes - I'm an engineer, not a mathematician. Another lab has a reputation for 8-10 year PhDs, so I've avoided that lab (although I get along well with the prof and have TAed his class).

The third lab belongs to a prof that was just hired from Europe. Its his first time being a professor (he previously worked in industry for a while). His area of research sounded super interesting to me and seems like it would be a great mix of application and theory.

I jumped on that boat and talked to him as soon as I could and set up some initial research with him. This was also the quarter I was taking quals. My school requires a certain number of units while taking quals, and typically people will take some units for research, with the understanding that they won't really get all that much research done. Prof's seem to be cool with this and generally seem to give A's or B's anyway. I told the prof I was working with about me taking quals etc, and he seemed ok with it. At the end of the quarter I went to talk to him about writing a short 1 or 2 page write up about what I had done so he would have some way of grading me. 

Out of the blue he told me that since I didn't have any research deliverables, he would have to fail me. After a lot of WTFing, I worked out a deal where I'd take an incomplete, do work over the summer (while working a full time internship) and get graded on that work. Even then, we had more mis-communication. He had shared the files I was using with me via Box. I hadn't checked them for a while as I was moving/getting started at work etc. One day, he evidently deleted all of them, because he assumed I would have made my own copy (wtf, its Box? That's literally the point of Box. Box does have version control, but only for a limited period of time and it was too long to retrieve the files.), so I had to wait around for him to get back from vacation before I could get to work on his shit. Why didn't I just work for him this summer then? Because he refused to pay me either for the summer, or during the regular school year as I had not previously worked for him (this was discussed at the beginning of the quarter, so he probably hadn't formed a negative opinion of me yet.)

Overall, I'd say this has not been a positive experience. I also took his class (it was the one real class I took my quals quarter - needed the units. Totally regret doing this.) Although the material was straightforward and interesting, I didn't have the time to sink into debugging hw or deeply understanding concepts. I didn't really prioritize the class all that high since I was studying for quals and TAing, so I didn't do all that well. Which led to a few snide remarks in emails about how I didn't give his class my all. I mean, christ i just got the lowest class grade I've ever gotten, do you really need to rub it in? Its a really strange juxtaposition since he seems like a really nice guy when you just go in and talk to him. Perhaps its some cultural differences since he spent his life in Europe? As far as I know, nobody else has had these kind of issues with him either.

Also, he is brand new, no guarantee he'll get tenure."

I paid with my debit card and money was taken out my bank account a day later.

I followed a friend's advice to dispute the transaction, but I have not been contacted about it by my bank yet.
Is there any other advice you guys have? I'm disappointed with this company since I enjoy their comedy and work, but they seem to only be able to be contacted by their website's message option.

I'm going to be finishing my under-graduation in one year from now.
I'm looking for a job after that.

I have a fair enough resume (with 2 awesome internships and a decent GPA).
Both my internships were pretty ""general"" I must say. I didn't work on bid-data or use Hadoop or write a compiler or write a driver for an OS or write a machine learning algorithm to suggest songs.

It was more of creating my own UI, and writing the application logic for my project and getting whatever data I need from whatever source (be it an SQL db or the DOM of the page).

When I look for positions to apply on-line, I find that I'd be happy to work in a lot of positions, but they have certain pre-requisites I don't satisfy.

For example some of them require me to be good at cloud, some require security, some require big-data, some require obscure (IMHO) programming languages like Java, some require Android application development.

For someone right out of college, I feel baffled when I try to look outside in-campus recruitment drives (where they look for more general CS stuff). I like and admire startups around the world but they have these specifications I'll never universally match. What do I do?

Also, is there something I need to go and learn to fit more into such real world profiles?
I've just taken my CS courses, know C, C++, JavaScript and a little Python. I can pretty much learn anything, but I haven't gone knee-deep into anything.

Please advise.

I graduated May 2012 from a top 5 USA public college. Have a Bachelors in a very specific field, Nanomedicine Engineering. For simplicity's sake, it's a combination of Biomedical Engineering, Materials science engineering, and chemistry. My education mainly had me in research working in labs.

Basically I was really naive getting out of college. I was told (by every authority figure i could remember) that if i did well in school I'd have a good job when i got out of college. So therefore i never thought about going to grad school, and by the time i realized i may need it, it was too late. So i ended up only having one offer after college: getting paid $15/hr to take 10 hour shifts until 2 am in a clean room. One half hour break and no bathroom breaks. In a completely different state. So naturally I declined it and went on my job search.

Well now it's 2 years later and I realize I need a lot of advice and a lot of help. I've become more agressive, talking to HR of places I'm applying to, and constantly searching for any job. But literally everytime I get to meet someone face-to-face, they say apply online. When I tell them that no one looks at those, or they take 6-8 months doing so, they basically say, 'not my problem.'

Im currently working 3 odd-jobs and its killing me. Both financially and mentally. I dont have any contacts in any field and no way to get a foot in the door. Even internships are too competitive to get here in NY. At this point, i'm willing to take any job in the area if it pays a real wage. 

So basically i need advice, what to do, how to do it, who to talk to, etc. Thanks guys."

**TL;DR: Target school graduate (top 5) in the US working for a year... just got a job at a boutique IB, but it's not the most ideal situation. Very grateful, nonetheless and learning a bit. Grades weren't the best, but I love this industry. Poli sci degree, which I very much value. Interested in also being a trader, specifically fixed income products. Want to start a hedge fund in around 10 years. Feel alone, as I'm the only analyst at the no-name firm. Feel isolated. Working in Texas. Umm... Worked in FX, but back office. DON'T want to do any back office work. Would like to network, but not with other people searching for work. Oh, also studying for my Series 79.**


I graduated from a target school (a top 5 school) in the US. It wasn't until late in my third year that I decided that I wanted to go the financial route. I didn't know much about investment banking until then, actually. I was just sitting at my computer, studying for the LSAT (because what else would you do studying poli sci?) when I decided that... I didn't really want to go to law school, no matter how good the school was. I didn't want to become a corporate lawyer. I also didn't want to work for the State Department or for the government. I didn't want to become a teacher, either. All of those were great ideas, and great professions, but they really just weren't for me. So I started researching the financial industry, as all my econ friends were prepping for their internships. 


A large part of it was the money, I will admit. But I didn't want to do something for the money if I didn't like it (consulting pays decently, but I just didn't want to be a consultant). So while I was researching investment banking, I had realized that something about the industry just drew me. I originally wanted to get into business in high school, but as a high school student, that didn't really mean much. Most people who wanted to do that I know went to study business in school. I did IR. Don't get me wrong, I loved my program and I very much value my degree in political science. Oh, I also didn't want to work at a think tank. Anyway! So there I am, falling in love with a profession that is very difficult to break into, even from a top school. But I hit the ground running. I read all the horror stories and about the burnouts, but I didn't care. We didn't do too much sleeping in school, anyway. I signed up for an accounting course at our business school (which is also a top 5 school), and though I didn't really like accounting, per se, I liked the concepts. Basically, I just learned from that course that I didn't want to be an accountant. But it was a stepping stone in the right direction. I immersed myself in finance. I had so much to learn, in so little time. I knew those interviewing me knew I didn't have the proper skills, but I never relented. Unfortunately, I couldn't get an internship. So my last summer before graduation, I was internship-less and had a strong desire to work in investment banking. I got a small gig at a little consulting firm at school, nothing special. And I was close to giving up again. I did get interviews, though (my resume isn't the strongest, nor were my grades, but it was an interesting resume), at boutique firms, funds of funds, bond trading desks... but I just wasn't good enough. 


I was so close to giving up, but I had (have) a wonderful girlfriend who just pushed me to keep trying. Problem was, as I said, I was internship-less at a vital point in my college career. Essentially, I felt fucked. My senior year came around and still didn't have much to show for it. I did sign up for a corporate finance class at our business school, and I fell in love with it. That was a definite reassurance that that's what I wanted to do. Unfortunately, I wasn't the best student. (I'm terrible at taking tests, but that's something I'm working on.) But around this time, it was the season to start searching for full-time work. By this point, I felt I was at par, if not a little bit ahead, of my counterparts searching for work in the industry. I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do, to be honest... but I knew it was investment banking. Again, I got a couple of interviews, one with BAC in their LatAm department.... but I screwed that one up. I was getting desperate. I even tried consulting. Got interviews there. Failed again. Got an offer at a law firm as basically a slave, because, let's face it, by this point I was close to giving up again, figuring that I just wasn't meant to be a banker. Then good ol' girlfriend came in and pushed me again.


I came back home to Texas and decided that I wanted to work here, anyway. Found a job a few months after college with a decent salary, far away from the financial industry and used that time to get my head straight. Interviewed again at BBVA for the investment banking division (they apparently have one!), but never heard back. Back in a slump, but not giving up. Then a friend came through and connected me with another friend whose dad started up a foreign exchange firm. They offered me a position in their back office, and I took it because it was the closest I'd get for now. 


That time spent in the back office was both great and not so great. I loved being around the Bloomberg Terminal! I liked watching the FX markets, and how macro events would affect them. I never considered a job as a trader of any sort, but watching my bosses work the phones and trade made me really excited. I opened up a play account with FXCM and started trading on my own, just to test out strategies. I had some good days, and some really bad days (just fucking around)... but I really enjoyed it. I was never good with the technicals, though. But I started to develop (and am still developing) a feeling for the charts. Figuring out where they're going and such. So that time there (a little less than a year) was a great experience and it opened up a completely new world to me.... that of trading. I came to the decision that I eventually wanted to start up a hedge fund. I gave myself a timeline... something around 10 years, and a path to it. However, I felt held back. We were just starting, and I understood how start-ups worked. But I was a little more ambitious than that. Besides, my bosses' visions were to keep me in the back office and eventually run the whole back office. But I definitely did not want that. They were great people, but it just wasn't working out. So there I went again, back on the hunt. I hated the hunt. I applied and applied... nothing. Even asked my bosses to put me in contact with people. But I think they didn't trust me (I made some minor learning mistakes while working there, seeing as I had no idea what I was doing at the beginning... eventually it was all efficient and error-free) and didn't really help in that regard. Tried and failed. Tried and failed. Etc.... It took me a couple of months, I was so close to giving up again, but I had that wonderful voice that believed and me and I got back up on that horse. 


I found a posting for an analyst position at a boutique firm... a no-name boutique firm. It belonged to a bigger accounting firm, but still felt like a start-up. I applied for it, because it was still what I wanted to do. I was still more interested on working on deals for the time-being. My bosses knew what I was doing and they were supportive. I applied and decided that I needed to do a little extra. I sent an email to the MD just asking to speak with him, and he gladly accepted. So we spoke. And we clicked. (Honestly, and I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I am 90% sure he was mostly interested in the name of my school, for he's alluded to it being a strong selling point for the firm. And I was okay with that.) For the next couple of weeks, we settled on a price and I started working here. I did my thorough research and I knew what to expect. And it's been as I've expected (sorta). Given the size and scope, the work is definitely more random. Deal flow is okay, and it's getting better. The size of the deals are small, indeed. But we're getting screwed on the fees. I'm grateful for where I am, and I will sound greedy, but the money still matters. Mostly with student debt (which isn't terrible, but I just wish it were gone). The work is a little more sparse than I'd like it to be, and I'm alone. That's probably the worst part. They stuck me in a windowless office (given the nature of my work, I needed to be secluded from the accountants at the firm), which is depressing. Another thing that attracted me to the industry was the talk of camaraderie. I saw some of the people going into I-Banking... they were intelligent, philosophical, interesting people. I miss that. So I socialize with some of the accountants at the firm, which is fine, but I still feel very alone here. 


So I know that the advice I'll get is to stay here a little longer, because I should be grateful. And I agree. I'm not planning on moving anytime soon. This is a great opportunity and I have better opportunity for advancement into more senior roles quicker than my BB counterparts. But I still have my eyes set on PE and Hedge Funds. And I know that coming from a no-name firm makes it very difficult to break in. I've searched for network opportunities, but most of them seem to be... networking with others seeking IB jobs, not with management seeking to mentor. Maybe I'm not searching in the right places. I am young and have a lot of time to work on this, but... I am also ambitious. I would love to be a bond trader, but I have no idea on where to start or what to study. I would also love to be an MD, but my boss doesn't seem to make much money, even for a no-name boutique. I see my friends from college already getting recruited for PE jobs. Making lots of friends at their current jobs. Building amazing connections. And I feel so behind. I'm not looking to get rich right now (though I wouldn't complain), but I'm looking to build a path to good wealth before I'm 40. Honestly, by the time I'm 30. I'm willing to work hard towards that. But like I said, I'm in a good spot. It isn't the most ideal. There are days I have zero work. I don't like that. But I also don't know if I'd stay in the office until 8 or 9 pm or 2 am if there was no one to share that experience with. I mean, I don't know if at BB it's normal to work those hours alone. But it's still a great opportunity and I consider myself very lucky. I dunno. This may be vain, but I feel that my degree is worth quite a bit more. Not an exorbitant amount... but just more. 

Any advice would be appreciated.  "
2d95lk,1,2014-08-11,X-fer degree questions.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2d95lk/xfer_degree_questions/,"Wall of text inc.

TL;DR - Hacking nerd in HS, did some pentests for IT-Net class, really loved it  

- Likes programming/app dev, and would love to learn more about it.
- Met w/ industry pros and they all tell me different degree options
- Ideally I'd love to mix the two. 
- Paying everything myself out of pocket, so school price is a factor as well. 
- What do?


Currently i'm enrolled in a Community College as a CS major. Originally, I went to and graduated from a Vo-Tech program for IT-Networking, and while it was interesting, I fell in love with Security! When choosing a major my options were CS or IT( for Associates ). I figured CompSci would be the better fit because most Associate programs focus more on the business side rather than the technical. Since then i've dabbled more into programming, and it really interests me, especially mobile development(Android). 


I was lucky enough to take a visit to my company's corporate HQ and sit down with the CIO, and members of each team: IT, Datacenter, Security, Mobile App, and Marketing tech. This really opened my eyes to the realities of each job, and role. As expected the Security team ,and the App team really stood out. To sum it up:

* Security team really made it a point, if you want to get into security get an InfoSec degree w/an 
internship as opposed to a CS degree
* App team wasn't really too picky on degree's, the Project Lead has no degree, but she informed me that my initial choice doesn't stand out as a tech school, and she's right about that. 
* The CIO didn't care about what school or my major was, she stated that all that mattered was obtaining a Bachelors and showing competency in your profession. She elaborated more on on what degree's meant not to just her, but to the industry as a whole. Her driving point was that there are many companies that refuse to promote and raise an employee due to education level, and my company was one of them. 
 

As for schools, [this](http://www.mc3.edu/academics/areas-of-study/stem/computer-science/computer-science-as) is my CC and [these](http://www.mc3.edu/academics/courses/1063-cis) are my options for the two electives my major offers. 

[School one](http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/) is West Chester as a CS Major. 
Pros:    

* Really cheap school, great for a guy w/ no money. I could walk away with less than 20k debt.
* Program has a concentration/cert in [Security](http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/isc/curricula.html) which is NSA approved, if that means anything. 
* Attenuation agreement, all credits x-fer.
* 31 miles away, so commuting is possible.
* If I obtain a scholarship at CC, they follow me to West Chester.

Cons:    

* This was the school the Mobile App lead was referring too. 
* Other schools like Drexel, Upenn, and Penn State have better recruiting options and will overshadow me. 
* No formal security degree. 

[School Two](http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/programs/baccalaureate/S/SRA) is Penn State Berks as an InfoSec Major (SRA)
Pros:  

* Company Security Team spoke highly of Penn State.
* Awesome recruiting opportunities.
* National recognition. 
* Short commute 

Cons:  

* Unsure if all credits x-fer
* Moderately expensive
* No CS program / only prog courses I get exposed to are from CC.

[School Three](http://www.drexel.edu/mccc/academics/overview/computing-security-technology/) is Drexel @MC3 as an Info Sec Major (Computing &amp; Sec Tech) 
Pros:  

* Security team spoke highly of Drexel
* Decent recruiting options
* Long drive but can commute
* All credits X-fer 
* CO-OP is built into the program, and usually well paying. I should note that Drexel has one of the best CO-OP programs in the country. 

Cons:  

* **EXPENSIVE** like no other
* No CS program / only prog courses I get exposed to are from CC.

I should note, one of the Security team members was a recent grad (2013) from an online degree program. I've pondered that idea in the past since they can be really cheap and flexiable. [WGU](http://www.wgu.edu) would be my choice if shit happens and I needed to have greater flexibility. 

Im sure a lot of you have pondered the same sort of problem, I like two things and wanna prepare for both! Any feedback would be helpful.

Optimally I would continue summer internships with this company until I graduate, then move up to a full time position with them. Still, I've started looking at what kinds of positions are available in my area, and a common requirement seems to be at least entry-level experience with ControlLogix. From the little research I've done, all I can really surmise is that it's a family of PLCs (I'm familiar with the function of PLCs, how they are integrated into a process, and do hobby electronics with microcontrollers and the like, but never any hands-on experience with professional controllers). The problem is that the project I'm on doesn't use ControlLogix, and I'd never heard of it before this, so I don't know of any way to even see a system that runs on it in action. 

Is there any kind of simulation, interface preview, overview, etc. on real world projects using this system that I could look at just to get some vague familiarity with ControlLogix?"
2d9zhn,1,2014-08-11,TIFU by being the worst intern ever,12trois,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2d9zhn/tifu_by_being_the_worst_intern_ever/,"In the high school I attended, all the students of one grade were required to perform a certain amount of unpaid work experience. I was initially excited about getting a job at one of my favourite restaurants, but at the last minute that fell through, and I ended up getting a position at a law firm. I was excited, because I was interested in law at the time.

Aside from being late the first two days as I got used to commuting by bus (I lived close enough to the high school to walk), the first couple of weeks went smoothly. I did what was asked of me, usually manual labour, and enjoyed myself there.

My boss, the head lawyer of the firm, assigned me to work on a personal project of his. Loosely described, it involved searching large collections of files for the three components of a set he wanted. (He told me that a previous intern had completely messed it up, but I'm not sure how much I believe him.) I would have been okay with this had all the components actually been present. I think, in the vast masses of files he gave me, I was only ever able to gather two sets. And the work was so gosh-darned *boring*.

After that, things started to go downhill. The following events are not necessarily in chronological order.

* **I violated his privacy.** On one occasion, due to the incompleteness of the files, I decided, ""Enough of this; I know he has everything on his computer."" So I unthinkingly went to his computer (he was away in court at the time) and used the search function of his email client to see if I could find what I wanted.
* **I threatened the sanctity of and insulted office property.** I was assigned to make several photocopies, or scan something, I don't know. It was taking a substantial amount of time without my intervention, and I was a bit bored, so I started tapping out a little beat on the copier. I was asked to stop and did. Sometime after this I made a mild complaint about the copier, and the articling student working under my boss told me ""It's a piece of crap."" When I was asked to stop a second time, I repeated his words, perhaps assuming that this was a common saying in the office. It wasn't.
* **I was highly forgetful and left duties incomplete.** After removing about 30 strips from self-sealing envelopes, I left them sitting in the middle of the floor. I was assigned to stamp many greeting cards for the office's clients; I did so hurriedly and poorly, and left the desk at which I was working covered in glitter with cards scattered everywhere. I successfully brought a case of soda from the trunk of a car to the office, but was not told where to put it. I left it in a meeting room and not the lunch room where it would obviously go.
* **All of this was how I repaid the kindness of the staff.** My birthday fell smack in the middle of the internship, and I humbly announced to the office during a quiet moment, ""If anyone cares, it's my birthday."" And all the staff got together to buy me a card and a cake and threw a surprise party for me a few hours later.
* **I accidentally told a lawyer with twenty years of experience that he was incompetent.** Court was what excited me about the internship, but I made only two trips to court during my time there. On my first trip, I was allowed to accompany my boss during a witness questioning for an insurance claim case. My boss had instructed me not to speak. We were sitting in some kind of waiting room, before we began, and he told me something like ""The defense is never prepared for this kind of case."" Soon after I was led into the questioning room, and sat with my boss across from another lawyer and the witness. There was some good-natured joking before the questioning began. I can't remember what was said, but I think the lawyers were rapid-firing silly stereotypes about cases at each other, which made me think it would be okay to repeat what he'd said, ""Defense not being prepared"".  
That lawyer and his witness *were* the defense. Somehow he took it in stride and ignored me, and I was allowed to sit in on the questioning.

But all these were not even the worst of what I did. My incompetence culminated in what I shall call **The Nutcracker Incident.**

It was the fall term, and Christmas was approaching. To celebrate this festive occasion, one of the staff told me to go to a storage closet downstairs and get a decorative nutcracker statue out of a closet.

I went down to the closet and found the nutcracker behind a tonne of junk. I cleared most of the junk out into the hallway, but hid a roadblock, so to speak. There was a huge box of computer equipment in the closet. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it out; it was too big and heavy. (Actually, I was just really stupid. The problem was that I and the box could not fit through the door side-by-side. I could have taken the equipment out, or dragged the box through the door.)

**Mistake 1:** The building's water heater was behind the nutcracker. I figured I could lift the computer box up over the nutcracker box, and onto the water heater, then I could take the nutcracker out of the closet. I managed this, but in pushing the computer box onto the water heater I accidentally turned one of the hot water valves off or to half position.

I finally see the nutcracker face-to-face...and there's a big hole in the box that extends into its forehead. **Mistake 2:** I figure, ""Ah, whatever, my job's not to assess damage. I'll just get it upstairs for them."" I should have to

I hauled the nutcracker out of the closet (gosh, that thing was heavy!) and through the closet's hallway to the main stairs (the office was on the second floor). **Mistake 3:** I left all the junk I had removed in the hallway, and did not put it away.

A brief interlude. This did not happen, but my boss suggested it could have. The water tank explodes because of the valve I adjusted. There is another office just off the closet's hallway. The people in that office cannot get out by their main door, because the water heater's pipes run over that door and it is engulfed in flames. So they must get out through the closet's hallway, where I have left all the junk. They trip over that junk trying to get away and burn to death.

Returning to reality, it took me quite some time and effort to get that heavy thing up the stairs to the office, at least fifteen minutes of grunting and puffing. But when I finally did, I learned of **mistake 4:** I hadn't listened to the directions properly. I hadn't been told to take the nutcracker to the office, only out of the closet.

The damage to the nutcracker was of course blamed on me, even if none of the staff directly said so.

I completed my hours some time after The Nutcracker Incident, but decided to stay on for a few more days as reparation for the Incident. About three days later, I was caught analyzing a chess game online when I was supposed to be doing data entry.

My boss was understandably outraged. He took me into his office, justifiably fired on the spot, and unjustifiably told me I would never amount to anything.

I have long considered suicide, but I attempted it for the first time the night he fired me because of those words. It was by a method that would never have succeeded, even if I hadn't grown too uncomfortable to continue.

He never submitted my evaluation form to my school, meaning I received a 51% grade for my work experience.

When the time came to choose my career, I did not choose law."

A big question I've been thinking about is whether my next internship should be a start up or a big corporation.


My past internship has been with Texas Instruments. Although I loved it there as a software engineer working in Linux, I would like to program a little higher in the abstraction level. I also believe I can work at a better company.


I'm pretty smart. I believe I can make it into the big four (or five). The startup I'm currently looking at is looking promising and I will definitely be doing substantial, interesting work. Potentially Android development, which I've been studying independently and find interesting. My experience at Texas Instruments has been doing minimal work, until I proved to them that I actually have potential. But that took two months, and until then, life was boring.


My plan is to just apply to every company and make my decision once the offers are in front of me. What does everyone think?


Start up or big corporation? Risk or stability?"

2dczw7,8,2014-08-12,Cannibal Tale,choluk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2dczw7/cannibal_tale/,"Shonda squinted over her glasses, and drew a tiny ""o"" in the very last space on the very last ledger. ""Finished!"" she cried out gaily; the quarterly books were done.
The boss peeked around the corner into her tiny office: ""All done, you say?"" It still sounded so funny to Shonda; he was so black, and his voice was so cosmopolitan; he sounded like a proper English banker, and that was what he had been. His eyes brightened over a gleaming smile. ""I say! Calls for a celebration, eh, what?""

He ducked back out; Shonda was so pleased with herself. When she'd taken the summer job between school years with the ExIm firm, she'd never dreamed she'd wind up doing the tribal books in a remote village in Uganda and when the assignment came, she surely never thought it would be like this. An African tribe? In Uganda? She had pictured growling savages, bones through their noses, grass skirts -- maybe even a big, cast iron pot for missionaries. She hesitated; then, the man with the ExIm firm started talking money. It would pay for a whole year's tuition, and then some, just for three months' apprentice accounting.

And then, why, they were just as nice as pie. They wore suits and ties, spoke well, to be honest, spoke better English than she did. Big, burly N'Gomo was a civil engineer, Master's degree from the University of Illinois; slender, sly M'Buto had already made millions from his start-up Internet firm. ""Systems management, don'cha know,"" he'd told her, eyes mischievous over that broad nose. ""They pay a villager in Uganda to tell them how to run a dimethylester plant in North Carolina!"" And he roared with laughter.

Ashasha, her immediate supervisor, had an MBA from Dartmouth; she had been President of the Senior Class. ""Rigid, rigid!"" she proclaimed, just a hint of a smile across her broad lips. ""Your mind must be rigid as a steel rod! No mistakes!"" Ashasha had caught many mistakes, at least in Shonda's early days; the blonde American watched, feeling like a complete klutz, as the African woman wearing a $1,500 suit from Bloomingdale's redid her work, checked it twice, thrice. ""Rigid!"" she announced, looking up and beaming; Shonda smiled, wearily.

The village was a fascinating mixture of old and new. Bentleys and Mercedes-Benz' were parked next to the squat little building where she did her work. Half-naked children played on the dusty road, while men in three-piece suits stopped to pat their heads, give them lollipops. None of the village was paved; every neat, tidy bungalow had its own garden. But from steel spires overhead splayed power lines, cellular phone antennae, cables; the men were always answering beepers, rushing off in their fancy cars, down the narrow lane to the highway a mile to the south, to Kampala.

For the village was fabulously wealthy. The tribe's ancient homeland was situated over a vast copper mine; the people, who had slaved within it for the imperial British, found themselves its owners when independence came in 1962. The village elders had wisely used their resources to buy friends and protection; the soldiers and horrors perpetrated by the tyrant Amin had left them unscathed. Shrewd investment, hedges against inflation, had left them well positioned when the metals markets took off in the Seventies.

Now, each of those friendly, earthy villagers had a trust in his or her name and managing them was Shonda's job. She kept track of mutual funds, stock portfolios, bonds the tribe had floated on the New York market; it was exhausting, and a little humbling. That little boy playing outside of the main offices was worth a hundred times as much as she was. ""You, missus!"" he had called when she first arrived in the village. ""You our new lady?""

Shonda smiled. Tall, leggy, and blonde, she stood out like the proverbial sore thumb. ""Yes; I'm the new lady. From the States.""

The lad giggled. ""Oh, get 'em from all over, we do! From Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and New Zealand."" He ambled up to her, eyes shining. ""Three months, right? Do the books, right?""

""Right,"" she said, her smile turning a little nervous. He couldn't have been eight years old. His pants were worn; he had no shoes, and an unbuttoned shirt. His eyes, huge and glistening, never left hers; finally, he laughed. ""Cracky!"" he sang out. ""Good show!"" And he was gone.

He came back frequently, gave her encouragement. ""Just two more months, now! Six weeks, mind! Won't be long!"" The other children would rush up, laughing and pointing; Ashasha shooed them away. The boss would peer out the window: ""What the devil?SAshasha, do you mind?""

The boss was tall, slender, distinguished-looking; tailored pearl-gray suits set off the sheen of his velvet skin, matched his close-cropped, iron gray hair. Mr. T'satsu was what everybody called him; he was the direct descendent of the tribe's first monarch. ""I guess that makes me the Chief, what?"" he chuckled. ""'Chief of the African tribe' and all that. I prefer Chairman, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lowlands Mining Co., Ltd. That 'Chief' stuff never made me a penny, you know."" Prepped at Eton, graduated first in his class at Oxford; Vice-President for Institutional Investment at Barclay's. Then back home. ""Missed the old place, y'know,"" he told Shonda as they pored over annuities. ""Friends, family co-workers,"" and gave her a wink. She flushed, and smiled, looking down self-consciously at the cascade of numerals.

It didn't bother her that he was so black, and she, so white; that she was barely twenty and he was more than twice that. It was just that he was, well such a damn gentleman, so classy, and when they finally made it one night after a hard days' assault on the books, he did everything so perfectly, right down to neatly folding her skirt and blazer over the imported mahogany chair in his office. ""I do hope I'm pleasing you, my dear,"" he said earnestly; she gasped as a staff worthy of royalty plumbed her very depths, filled her to her cusp, left her quivering in dopey, happy bliss. As each firm, unyielding thrust found yet another bottom to her, she kept thinking of Ashasha saying, ""Rigid! rigid!""

As she lay on the overstuffed divan, slack and reeling from the experience, he knelt beside her; gently, he nibbled on one of her nipples, and the sensation was exquisite. Then, he tenderly wiped a little drool off the corner of her lip with an embroidered silk hankie. ""There, now!"" Mr. T'satsu exclaimed. ""Quite a fun romp, eh?"" And he offered her an imported Swiss chocolate truffle.

All of the food was fantastic; she had wondered what they ate in Uganda-yak? If yak it was, it was elegant filet of yak chateaubriand, prepared by the most accomplished European chefs, garnished with foie gras. Morning, noon and night, the food was the richest, most sumptuous Shonda could imagine. To her dismay, she found she was gaining a few pounds; stepping out of the shower in her little cottage, she frowned at her figure, full and getting fuller, in the full-length mirror behind the bathroom door. She'd hoped to be able to sweat it off in the hot, tropical sun-but her employers wouldn't let her; they escorted her everywhere in her luxury cars, never let her out of their sight. ""You're quite a valuable resource,"" chuckled Mr. T'satsu when she asked about it. ""You can't imagine!""

Their midnight rendezvous' were infrequent; he was usually expecting a call, or in the middle of a teleconference. Besides, Shonda was putting in fourteen hour days, and was usually exhausted by week's end. N'Gomo would be summoned to drive her back to her modest guesthouse at the other end of the village. With the end of her internship approaching on a hot August evening, Mr. T'satsu had again turned her down (""Dreadfully sorry; monthly book-squaring. Deuced bother.""); she looked hungrily at the husky N'Gomo, brushed against him as they bumped along the dirt road in the mining company's black El Dorado.

Came time to get out; she put a hand on that broad bicep. He looked at her, evenly; her blue eyes were hopeful, pleading, frankly inviting. A short pause. ""Got to get back, Missus,"" he apologized, firmly. ""Can't you stay a moment?"" she purred; the hand crept up to his shoulder. He shook his head; ever so delicately, removed her hand. ""Mr. T'satsu wouldn't like it. Evening, Missus."" He puttered off; she stared after him, feet spread, knees knocking together.

""Cracky!"" It was the little boy, squatting in the dust by her cabin. She glared at him; he jumped up and whooped, danced away down the path ""Enjoy it, Missus! Not much longer now! Just two more weeks!""

The two weeks passed quickly. Shonda was now getting to be a pro at deductions and appreciation, returns and debentures. Wait'll she showed 'em back home, she thought pridefully, as she whizzed through one account after another, eyes peering over glasses set low on the tip of her nose. And that old Mr. T'satsu, why, I've had better.

He popped back in with two crystal goblets. ""Do join me,"" he begged. ""Champagne. The end of the quarter is such an event. Time to celebrate."" They quaffed a couple; she giggled, they nestled. For some reason, they'd forgotten to bring her any meals since yesterday's breakfast-she hadn't missed it until now, in the rush to finish up-and the fine wine knocked her for a loop. Soon, she was on her back. It was broad daylight outside. Her eyes were wide; their faces were only inches apart as he gently plucked off her glasses. ""Won't the villagers-"" Shonda sucked in her breath as Mr. T'satsu's royal scepter was driven home; how could she have room down there for all that?-""get suspicious?""

He looked puzzled. ""Suspicious? Oh, sorry,"" and his face split into a grin, ""forgot myself. They know.""

She swallowed; despite the flush of the moment, it hit her. ""They know? Everybody in the village knows that you and me-"" Her voice trailed away, replaced by squeaks of pleasure. The boss went at her firmly, forcefully rigid as a steel rod, she thought. Her consternation melted away; hey! she thought. I'm having a roll in the hay with The Chief; with the Chairman of the Board! She barely noticed as he rose, dressed, kissed her hand, and left.

Hands on her arms roused her from a cotton-candy reverie. Her eyes snapped open. Two tribesmen held her firmly. ""Hey!"" Long, bare legs lashed out; a black, sinewy hand closed around one ankle. She screamed.

""Don't you know us, Missus?""

She did. Mr. T'satsu's nephew, Motu-he was a foreman with the company-and the other fellow, the one who had played football at Brown. She quieted for a moment, realized she wasn't wearing a stitch, and tried to shrink into her own skin. ""Got to come with us, Missus,"" said Motu. ""End of the quarter.""

Shonda squirmed in their unyielding grips. ""Let go!"" she snapped, flailing with her free leg. No way; also now held just as tight. She stared at one peaceful, impassive face, then the other; her chest heaved.

""Time to go,"" said the football player, and the two easily carried their naked prey out the door, past the excited crowd of children, the men with their cell phones, the parked luxury cars. Shonda's shrieks blended with the hubbub of the scene; she twisted and struggled. Some of the villagers ignored her; some of them eyed her intently. And the children danced around her merrily.

She heard a familiar, high-pitched voice. ""Cracky!"" He was scampering along beside them as the two men lugged Shonda through the village, past the little buildings, the police department, the physician's office, the Events Building decorated with a banner reading, RECEPTION TO-NIGHT.

She looked at the raucously happy little boy, stopped in mid-scream. ""Where are they taking me?"" she shouted over the uproar.

""The three months is up, Missus!"" he hollered back. ""Big party! End of the quarter!""

Well really, that didn't sound so bad; Shonda calmed a bit. ""My clothes!"" she yelled; there were now a score or more villagers following along, as the young men marched her toward the village square. ""I need my clothes!""

The boy leaned over her; his eyes gleamed, his teeth bared in a tremendous smile. ""No,"" he shouted back. ""You don't!"" She didn't.

There was a pole in the square, a tether attached to it. The men set her down; Motu tied the tether firmly around her neck, while the jock bound her hands behind her back with coarse hemp, then tied her feet. As they stepped away, the villagers began arriving.

Sprawled on the ground, bound and helpless, Shonda had never seen the people of the village like this. The expensive clothes were gone, replaced by native dress-colorful blouses, loincloths, elaborate jewelry. And yet, there was the company's Vice-President for Mercantile Affairs gesticulating wildly as he barked orders into his cell phone, one bare foot rubbing against the other as if he were still shod in $150 Johnston Murphys. And there was the Director of Metallurgic Research, in a crouch, tapping feverishly into a laptop perched on a mound of sod, eyes peering through horn-rimmed glasses. And there in front of her, in a spectacularly colorful sarong sort of thing, was- ""Ashasha!"" Shonda cried, thinking, she's always got me outdressed! The native woman's impressive physique swelled the bust and derriere of her wrap; she smiled at her temporary assistant.

""Impressive,"" said Ashasha, as she slowly circled the trembling, naked girl. She reached down, squeezed one of Shonda's full thighs, remarked, ""I see our local diet has agreed with you,"" as the natives whooped with laughter. ""Now, I want you to remain perfectly still, Shonda,"" her supervisor continued. ""You must remain fixed and focused, for this next step is extremely important."" As she spoke, two other women quickly moved to either side of Shonda; one grabbed her long blonde hair, shoved her face into the ground. Shonda protested, and then suddenly yelped-for her rectum had been invaded by a cold, long, narrow ooooohhhhh! She felt herself fill, and fill, and she thought she'd burst-then, the object was pulled free, and what was inside Shonda was spilling out onto the ground around her. She cried as the women flushed her a second time, then a third. ""Running clean,"" Ashasha proclaimed. ""Quite good; efficient work."" Shonda lay sniffling, only to start bawling again as a hose was trained on her, rinsed her clean, sprayed the long, lush grasses beneath her free of taint. ""Now, the preparation!""

Shonda looked up; a massive man loomed over her, several others clustering around him. The big man clapped his pudgy hands; the others quickly surrounded her, and Shonda felt a dozen hands fondling her bare skin, massaging her, rubbing her, squeezing her-what is this? And then, her nostrils were assaulted by pungent odors.

""Native spices,"" said a familiar voice. ""Authentic Ugandan cuisine."" Sure enough, there the bastard was. A headdress that made him look vaguely buffalo-like adorned his pepper-and-salt hair; a great crimson cape flowed behind him, fixed to his bare shoulders by a golden sash. A matted leopard skin was wrapped around his narrow hips. He looked, well, ridiculous.

""Mr. T'satsu,"" she said, as firmly as a bound and naked woman could under the circumstances-the fat guy's flunkies were all over her, rubbing the fragrant dusts into her-""please tell these people to let me go.""

""You see, my dear,"" said the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lowlands Mining Co., Ltd., as he looked down, frowned and adjusted his sash, ""this is our way of celebrating the seasons, as did our ancestors. Every quarter, we bring in a new Temporary Accountant, like yourself; every quarter, when the books are finished-well, you've seen how hard we all work. We allow ourselves a day of celebration; a day of great merriment, and feast.""

""Wonderful!"" Shonda said through gritted teeth, straining at the hemp that held her wrists and ankles, ""it sounds like a great party!"" One of the assistants looked up at the fat guy and nodded; he clapped again. There was something going on behind Shonda; tribesmen were laughing and pointing. She looked up at the boss, eyes welling up. ""What are you going to do with me?""

""Ready,"" said a Fat Guy Assistant. Another untied the tether around Shonda's neck; two of them picked her up, turned her around.

""A copper pot, of course,"" said Mr. T'satsu behind Shonda, as she stared at the huge cauldron filled with water, tufts of flame billowing up from beneath it. ""Symbolic of how far we've come as a people. From crude primitives to sophisticated, productive citizens of the brave new world. I beg your pardon; N'Gomo! Have you got the yams?""

As the two men held Shonda's knees apart, the burly N'Gomo arrived, brandishing the starchy vegetables. They glistened wetly with some sort of grease; felt slick against her labia. ""Open up, Missus,"" he grinned, and she howled as the pointed tip probed her, then slid into her-even deeper than old T'satsu, she decided through the pain. They flipped her; already rubbed raw by the steel pipe, her bunghole felt like it was being traced with a razor as the sweet potato was driven in. She screamed, a sound lost through the bustle, the native jabber, the rumble of drums, the insistent staccato of a beeper.

Shonda bucked feebly, her breasts bouncing and buttocks jiggling, as the men marched with her to the pot. Thin fingers of steam were already wafting from the broth within; she stared at the enormous mouth of the pot, made one last strain at her bindings. ""In,"" commanded the Chief, and they plopped her in.

Her skin screamed in protest; every square inch of her felt the pain. The hot water lapped at her nipples; her skin quickly reddened. Shonda's tears flowed freely, mixed with the salty water; the fat guy-""Trained in the culinary arts in Paris,"" Mr. T'satsu told her-chopped into the pot leafy vegetables, bulbous onions, colorful roots. Her screams gave way to intermittent gasps, incoherent yelps, and an occasional plea for mercy; scraps of the vegetables decorated her skin as Paris Boy whittled away at his produce. The heat was unbearable; Shonda thrashed in what was becoming a vegetable broth, feeling her very flesh start to cook, its humours seep into the liquid. Her eyes were clenched, leaking tears; finally, she heard the crowd quiet, and opened her eyes. Her boss, her lover-the Chairman!-stood before her, holding a mango.

""I did want to tell you,"" he said, after he had rammed the pulpy fruit into her mouth with one hand, holding her head with the other, ""that you were the best the ExIm company has sent. Top drawer work."" As the naked girl peered at him in anguish, teeth clenched around the mango, sweat and her own juices pouring from her skin, the broth in which she simmered started to roll to a full boil.

""Quite so!"" proclaimed M'Buto as he rifled through the annual report. ""The Number Three mine boosted productivity eighteen percent! I told you so!"" He set the report down on the piano, sucked another chunk of Shonda's thigh off the long wooden pick on his plate. The Board of Directors was holding its annual reception; while an orchestra played in the ballroom of the Events Building, the French Chef's minions dished up slivers of breast and buttock from the boiled, reddened carcass that rested, surrounded by fresh grapes and ripe cheeses, on a platter at the serving station. Shonda's eyes were wide and unseeing; her mouth still gripped the mango. Liberal portions of her had already been cut away, one tiny serving at a time; bone showed through the soft, pink meat of her shoulder, slabs had been sliced from her loin. The vegetables that had simmered with her were in a massive bowl nearby; the tribespeople spooned helpings from it next to their pieces of Shonda, savoring each bite. They had shed the colorful, traditional attire, and were in suits and evening gowns as they talked about their portfolios, their investments, the flavor of the blonde American on the platter compared to the girls from Switzerland, from the Netherlands, from New Zealand. The next Temporary Accountant would arrive in the morning; she was, one of the Board members said, a French Canadian lass. A redhead.

""The fund was up year to year again,"" commented the Vice-President for Mercantile Affairs; he used a small, silver cocktail fork to impale bits of belly meat, then chunks of leek and okra from the bowl. ""Mr. Chairman!"" he said around a mouthful of human flesh. ""Another outstanding quarter."" Mr. T'satsu, resplendent in pearl gray, nodded, winked at the man in the apron, who smiled back and handed him a plate from behind the counter. The Chairman glanced down at it, at the two large nipples upon it.

""Thank you, gentlemen,"" he proclaimed, spearing a nipple with a fork. ""We couldn't have done it,"" he continued, nibbling on the meat, ""without a great deal of help.""

I am Mr. T'satsu. Care to join my firm and visit glorious Africa?"

[What would be your top 3 to 5 ways the average person can help young women be empowered?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjoad02?context=5)|Number 1: Support them. Our philosophy is getting girls through college, not just to college, and sometimes through means helping with child care, helping with internships, helping with gas money, helping find a job - there are lots of ways you can help young women with all of those things.
 |Number 2: advice. Spell out exactly how hard it was for you to get through. Sometimes when people read my resume as they're introducing me, it makes my entire life sound like peaches &amp; cream - it's the highlights of all you've accomplished, and i want to start off by saying ""well, here's all the crap that went badly"" so you can fully understand where I""m coming from. I think young people need to hear how tough times can be overcome.
 |Number 3: If you know a young woman who is a mom, babysit for her for free. Just take her kid for the day, give her free baby sitting so she can have a break and a day off. I think that's an amazingly great gift to give someone.
 |By the way, I have 4 kids, if you want to come babysit for me for free - I'd be grateful ;)
 |LOL.
[I remember seeing you on TV's ""The Site"" ... What lessons did you take away from that job that you applied to the rest of your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo8o3u?context=5)|Only 6 people watched The Site - you and 5 other people in my family.
 |Lessons i took for my career was that it's really hard to live in San Francisco on $30,000 a year (just kidding!).
 |That was a fun show, but way ahead of its time. We reported on the internet every night. Who would have thought there would be enough to talk about on the internet, about the internet? It was the first show that was an anchor job for me, and I think the main thing that I took away from it was how the people around you can create a really good ecosystem. People were incredibly kind to me for this being my first anchoring gig, and I've tried to repay that kindness when I've had the chance to be the veteran and someone else was the newbie.
 |This was 1996. It was a show that launched with MSNBC when the network launched. And we did ""Do you wanna search for your adopted child? HTML will show you how to do it!""
 |Here's an old example of devnull: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuRPNs3jTJ8)
[Viewer #7 reporting in! I loved that show :\) you were a great host.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo9bzp?context=5)|My mother appreciates you. 
[I also was a big fan of The Site. I was quite upset when you were pre-empted and then cancelled in favor of incessant Princess Diana deathwatch coverage. Her death was tragic, but the constant blitz became morbid and excessive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjoai0r?context=5)|It was the first time in my reporting experience where rolling coverage of a breaking news story removed the taped show that we were doing. It was a year into MSNBC, and they knew that cable was going to be breaking news, and that a taped show was never going to be as relevant as something that was unfolding at that moment. And it really changed how I felt about reporting - as much as I love doing documentaries, I'd love to get back to a show at some point, maybe for the 2016 election, because to really have a voice in the conversation, it helps to have a daily show, because that conversation is shifting all the time. 
[Viewer #8 reporting. Do you ever keep in contact with Cliff Stoll?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo9x8l?context=5)|No I don't keep in contact with Cliff Stoll at all!
[On a side note, I actually kind of miss the show MSNBC used to have that showed the archived news broadcasts and clips.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo9x8l?context=5)|Clearly, we need to do a crowd funding to underwrite a new pilot for *The Site: 2.* 
[What story should the national consciousness be paying more attention to at the moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo8nq9?context=5)|I think a great example is this Michael Brown situation - we often cover stories about young men being shot, like the shooting of Michael Brown, as a ""story of the day,"" and I think stories like that need to be looked at in the greater context of the value of the life of young African-Americans. So to me, an interesting story would be examining -  not just through that one story, but the way in which it seems that the value of the human life, when we're talking about a young black man, is low.
 |I think that would be interesting to explore.
 |Also, I have lots of friends who are journalists last night reporting that the media was being told they had to leave Ferguson, or be arrested, and I haven't really seen that on-air today. So that said, I'm not covering that story live, so my perspective is a little bit from a distance, but I think that that's an important story. 
[How did it feel to leave the morning news show at CNN?  You were fabulous and I was so disappointed that CNN chose to go fluffy in the morning after you left.  (I now watch Al-Jazeera America for my news.\) Was it hard for you to go on to other things or were you ready to go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo8pls?context=5)|The show was going a different direction.
 |And they wanted to have a new team in place. And that didn't include me.
 |But I had really been thinking about running a production company for a couple of years, and I had the financial where-with-all to do it.
 |I think the hardest thing is to leave colleagues whom you've spent a lot of time working with on some pretty intense stories (10 years really). And to leap to something that was very different than what I'd been doing for most of my life - i.e. being a CEO, running and managing a company, is a little daunting. But now 1 year and 2 months later, it's going really well, and it's exciting. And the things that seem to be big challenges, ended up, some of them, being ""growth opportunities"" and some of them turned out to be things that were really easy to navigate.
[I'm glad it worked out for you.  But it was a big loss for us viewers! I admired how you would politely but firmly ask difficult questions of your interviewees, both left and right.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo9jpu?context=5)|Every time I got really annoyed, I would try to remember to use the word ""sir"" more.  I felt that way I couldn't be accused of being disrespectful. 
[I'm a white man in an interracial relationship with a mixed race woman. It's difficult for me to understand the value she has for her culture, since I've never cared much about my roots. What does being mixed race mean to you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjoabi1?context=5)|I think it's less about valuing her culture - which is, as you put it, a mix of cultures - and more about valuing her conversation as she navigates her way between these cultures. Being mixed race never meant a specific thing to me. Often it was a feeling of being an outsider even in your hometown, of not necessarily feeling like you belonged in a  certain place, of having people say rude &amp; inappropriate things to you without even realizing they were particularly hurtful. That said, I think ultimately it's helpful for a journalist to be an outsider. My guess is your significant other wants you to *HEAR* what she's saying about trying to navigate something that in America, actually, still carries a tremendous amount of weight, even as we like to pretend to be post-racial. 
[Thanks so much for your response. I look forward to watching your documentary. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjob07i?context=5)|Thank you, and if you want to talk to the 3 veterans who are featured in the piece, they will be tweeting live at 9 PM and will be happy to  answer your questions. 
[What type of philanthropy are you involved in? How did you get started and what motivated you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo8qe2?context=5)|I run, and founded, the Soledad O'Brien and Brad Raymond Starfish Foundation ([Link to www.obrienraymondfoundation.com](http://www.obrienraymondfoundation.com). We send young women to and through college. What motivated me was the frustration I felt in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that there were so many practical things we could do to help young people get ahead, and many things in New Orleans were just mired in red tape. We started in New Orleans, and today our 25 scholars are in colleges around the country, and we are on track to host several thousand young women at our daily empowerment summit for girls in 2015. If you want to check out the website, you can learn more. 
[Soledad, Much has been made about the ""state of journalism"" regarding its partisan nature, or the death of print journalism and even the decline of real and unbiased journalism. What do you feel is the greatest challenge to journalism? Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjo9fbi?context=5)|I feel very optimistic about journalism. The technology has gotten much cheaper and the quality is much higher, so individuals can grab a camera and shoot stories without being sent by a major corporation. There are many more organizations that are paying journalists today than when I started 26 years ago. The biggest challenge, I think is what I hear some younger colleagues of mine say, which is - where do they go to GROW? My path was to start in local news, eventually become a producer, go to network news, eventually go to a local station to start reporting, go to a network to start anchoring - many younger colleagues of mine say that path doesn't seem to exist for them.
[In the trailer posted for The War Comes Home, I see the vets doing therapy with horses. What role do you think animals play in the therapy of people who suffer from PTSD?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjoa980?context=5)|Our documentary looks at equine therapy, which has been done for quite a while with veterans who have post-traumatic stress. The experts in equine therapy describe the horses as being very similar to the veterans - kind of skittish, not very trusting, and the therapy forces the veterans to figure out how to communicate with a 2000 pound animal that you just can't pick up and move around a ring. It seems to be very effective, and several of the veterans I spoke to described it as their ""a-ha"" moment - that they realized they had to learn how to communicate more effectively with people, as opposed to just barking orders. 
[How could antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria be covered like the ebola virus? What's the big difference? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dcqfb/im_soledad_obrien_journalist_ceo_of/cjob75a?context=5)|I think what makes a story interesting at times is the sense of hysteria around it, and ebola has a lot of that. But ultimately, the thing that is really critical in prevention of disease is scrubbing your hands with hot water and soap - when was the last time you saw a story on that? Never ever, because it's boring. But research has shown that if you want to cut down on spread of disease, that would be the main thing to do. Ebola - which will affect virtually no one in the United States - will get much more coverage than washing your hands with hot water and soap.

Even though I am going down the embedded systems route, I also quite enjoy programming GUIs and mobile applications with java, so I am also considering looking for a software programming career as well. I only know C, C++, Java, and Assembly though. 

I know my question is quite broad, but any insight on the job descriptions would be well appreciated. I don't have any internships or co-ops that pertain to either field, so I do not have any experience on what it would be like to work for either side.

Basically a co-op is like an internship which is endorsed by the school and done in between semesters. We need 3 co-op terms to graduate. I've already missed the first one and if I miss the second one I won't graduate. 

There lies my problem, I've failed one of my classes this semester due to personal problems and as a result I am not eligible for co-op. This would be fine if I didn't already get an offer from a pretty big company that my father works at and is putting a lot into it.

I can still do my co-op if I retake the course next semester and the employers agree to take me on even though I may not be eligible until the middle or the end of it (employers get tax breaks for taking co-op students). It's a small chance but I'm taking it. My question is what is my next step if they don't go for it? I was planning on dropping out and moving out maybe doing some freelance programming on the side. I have 900 dollars saved up and I don't know if that would be enough to keep me afloat. Thoughts?"

Ever since I was a little kid, life has been a pretty shitty experience. I've never meet my dad once (I don't even know his name or if he's even alive), my mother has had shitty health pretty much since she's given birth to me, and being a first generation child, I have no family in the states that have been able to help out my family, and I've ended up living under the poverty line pretty much all my life. Though what has been worst is that I've been bullied almost all my childhood, and I've developed suicidal thoughts towards the end of middle school, but thankfully I was too young to properly grasp the concept of suicide and never followed through with those thoughts. 

Things got a bit better in high school, as I at least got along with my classmates and managed to make some friends, but any personal struggles I've kept secret from basically everyone that I know. Fast forward now, I'm 18 starting my sophomore year of uni and my suicidal thoughts have returned, but lately they've been far too intense compared to what I'm accustomed to. Since late winter of last year, on a daily basis, I end up having intense thoughts of despair and hopelessness, and twice I've come close to going through with committing suicide. 

Thankfully with perhaps the first time I've opened up with anyone about my thoughts, I was recommended to my uni's wellness center, and for once I was actually getting some help. I still kept this secret from pretty much everyone I know, including my mother, but when summer came around, I found out that my counselor was going to be gone for the summer, and as a result, I've had to basically deal with my problems alone for the summer, since I'm not particularly fond of well talking about my problems with well anyone. I went out of my way to keep myself busy this summer and got myself a internship as a way to keep myself preoccupied at all times so suicidal thoughts wouldn't be so overwhelming. 

Things have gone great at my internship, as I've started to learn to more about being more social and outgoing, and I was even offered to stay after the summer as a part time intern while I'm in school. I know I should feel happy and well accomplished, but to be honest I feel miserable. This week especially has been a terrible week, as one of the staff members in my office passed away, and death has perhaps been the biggest trigger to suicidal thoughts for me, as it reminds me of what could happen if I actually went through with those thoughts, and with the recent passing of Robin Williams, all I see on my facebook feed is nothing but status about suicide and depression and how no one should suffer through depression alone. I know I need help at this point, but I'm honestly scared shitless that I'm going to let down a lot of people, especially my mother and co-workers, as I'm the only one in my household who brings in any money from work, and I play a pretty important role in my company's team. I honestly don't know where else to turn and how to even get help anymore... 

tl;dr: I've been dealt some shitty ass cards my entire life and my suicidal thoughts are getting out of control. What do I do? "

2den2y,1,2014-08-13,Questions about return offers as an intern,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2den2y/questions_about_return_offers_as_an_intern/,"I posted in the weekly intern thread but kind of late so I didn't get any feedback. I have a meeting with my recruiter later this week where they will formally make me an offer (manager spilled the beans) to return after graduation.

One of the other interns already went through the process and talking to him/her raised some questions. Some background info, this is at a remote office of a very large well known tech company.

First, they asked him/her how long they need to make a decision and they responded 1 month so their deadline is in September. I was expecting to have a deadline around November so a September deadline seems kind of ridiculous to me. What's a reasonable deadline for return offers? I'll most likely accept the offer but I wouldn't mind the opportunity to interview at other places as well.

The second question I had was base pay. As an intern, the pay is standard across the company, so in the city I'm in I get paid quite well even compared to new grads. By the sounds of it from the other itern's offer is that the base pay is about the same or possibly less than what we're paid as interns. Is this something I have leverage with and push back on or should I just be grateful to be compensated so well as an intern? To be fair, I'm being paid more now as an intern than the average new grad in my city. The average pay in my city compared to its cost of living is quite low compared to other cities though.

Thanks for your time, and have a lovely evening."

It’s here.

I don’t know why they brought it here, but they did. Dr. Kent Brantly, along with a missionary, became infected with the Ebola virus while treating patients in West Africa, despite the fact that they took the utmost precautions against the infection. They followed every protocol in their treatment. They never came into any sort of skin on skin contact with patients, properly disinfected or discarded hazmat suits, and were monitored daily. Suddenly both began to show antibodies in their blood. No one expected the staff to become infected; the risk was always there, but such extreme measures were taken to prevent such an event that it was nearly a statistical impossibility. The only real way that the infection should’ve been possible was if the virus had somehow become airborne. That’s the main weakness of Ebola; it needs bodily fluid to transmit. Sweat, tears, semen, blood and mucus are all common ways that Ebola spreads, but this time it seems different. People are getting sick when they shouldn’t be.

I watched in horror as “Dr. Brantly” walked into the hospital on TV. I don’t know who or what that was in the hazmat suit that walked through the doors of the Emory University hospital in Atlanta…but it wasn’t Dr. Brantly; no one with Ebola would be allowed that sort of freedom of movement. If his suit were to tear on the ground and somehow a small bit of contaminant leaked out he could infect countless others before they had any idea what had happened. 

I did one of my previous internships at Emory, and have several friends who still work there. Some of them just quit with good reason. There’s a room under an incredible amount of protection, air in is monitored versus air out, the lighting in the room is controlled based on what can kill off infection, and the staff allowed into the room is so restricted that even if someone coded inside the crash cart would still have to have someone buzz them through the doors. That someone would be, from what I can tell, a heavily armed, highly trained officer of some sort.

I spent last week working my way into the hospital. My courses through the University allow me access to certain areas, and, due to my area of study I was granted access to that wing of the hospital despite the events that have already transpired. I was both terrified and elated at the same time. The pass that I had wouldn’t get me access to the room, but it did allow me to analyze the data taken from other patients in Monrovia. I wasn’t allowed to do anything with the actual samples as they’d all been disposed of in safe containers and were sent to a secure location offsite to be incinerated. The data, however, was mine for the taking.

I poured over the infection and was startled to find that, unlike the 2012 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo the current strand seemed to take less time on average for symptoms to manifest. The infection could still take the entire three weeks to take hold, but many patients were showing antibodies in less than a week from their supposed exposure to the virus. While this does mean that carriers have less time to expose others to Ebola, it also means that it’s becoming more efficient.

While in the lab at the hospital I noticed a strange smallish looking man. He had very dark skin and looked eerily familiar. He was wearing the garb of a surgeon. He would come and go through the secure doors on a regular basis and never seemed to interact with anyone. I could only ever see his eyes because of the protective gear and mask filter he wore. But his eyes shook me to the core. It had to be the same face. I was sure of it. He made eye contact with me once or twice and I could see his expression was the same fiery passion that I saw in Guinea.

I tried to find out who he was. I expected to find no data whatsoever on the good doctor, but, to my surprise, he was very well documented. His name is Dr. Wilson. His ID checks out, and he bears a startling resemblance to the man I knew as Dr. Akachi, but as best as I can tell he is a normal doctor. He grew up outside of Orlando Florida and went to med school right here in Atlanta. Something still seemed odd about him, however. I began to snoop…well, maybe stalk is a better word, but I was both curious and terrified at this point, and the last time I raised a big stink about something…it didn’t end well.

First I began to focus on the outbreak; I was looking for cases of illness that looked similar to Ebola but had been diagnosed as something entirely different. I started with people who’d reported recent travel to Africa in any way, shape or form. After finding more than a few cases of malaria I decided to switch gears; I looked specifically into GI disorders. One of the hallmarks of Ebola is intestinal distress and bleeding. A few unlikely hits came up; a teenager with a rare bowel disorder that had been diagnosed since birth had recently passed away, a middle school teacher with a perforated bowel who had suffered through two horrible infections before succumbing to the third, and a sanitation worker for a waste disposal firm contracted by Emory University Hospital who’d recently died of complications related to Crohn’s Disease. This one caught my attention.

I began to look into the file on the man. It had been flagged by the CDC in their watch for symptomatic individuals, but the man had no risk factors for Ebola and had a known preexisting condition that led to frequent bowel bleeds. The thing that caught my eye was how minor it was prior to his death. He reportedly suffered from one to three attacks per year for the first fifty years of his life, and then suddenly has two major episodes in less than one week. He was also an alcoholic and had the liver of someone in their 80’s, doing himself no favors. He was not tested for Ebola as there are only a few facilities nationwide that can safely handle a sample for testing, and he was not deemed sufficiently at risk for the virus. The middle school teacher had actually been tested as she had a relative who had recently returned from a vacation in Africa that included a jungle safari in the Congolese rainforest. Her results were negative.

I went over the known data on the sanitation worker. I mentally began to refer to him as US patient three as he was possibly the third US Ebola victim, and possibly the first US fatality. P3 was asymptomatic until August 3, 2014. He was dead less than three full days later on the morning I discovered his case. This is an incredibly quick turnaround; two days for infection and three days for death, assuming his infection is related to Dr. Brantly, and is usually indicative of a very direct contact with either blood or some other bodily fluid in great quantities. I could find no other link to the Ebola virus or Africa in any sense. I had to assume that he’d somehow been infected by Dr. Brantly’s return to the US. That’s when I switched back to the doctor.

Dr. “Wilson” stuck to a strict schedule. I discovered that he deviated from his schedule every Thursday. I decided that had to be it. That was when Wilson became Akachi. I also noted that, although he was a very on the record person, his time-clock would occasionally be off by an hour or so. This information was given to me by a very helpful nurse whom I may or may not know on a personal level and who shall remain very nameless.

I tailed him last Thursday; he didn’t clock out when he left, and I was hoping that he’d stick to his normal routine and lead me to…I don’t know. I have no idea what I expected. The villages of Guinea? Medical tents set up with small cots containing the withering bodies of already doomed patients suffering from the end stages of Ebola maybe? I wasn’t sure, but I can say for certain that whatever I was expecting…I was wrong.

He drove into a very sketchy part of town that held mainly abandoned warehouses. I followed as discretely as I possibly could, and at one point had to make an interesting serious of turns, of very questionable legality, to look like I was going a different direction while still managing to follow his jet black BMW. Finally he pulled up next to a large warehouse that looked to be at least fifty years old and in a state of severe disrepair. It was nearly dark outside and I followed on foot at the closest distance I thought I could manage without being made. I almost lost him when he stepped down a series of stairs leading into a club beneath one of the warehouses. 

I realized something was off as the neon sign buzzed in the evening air. I paid the ten dollar cover and, sure enough, there was Dr. Wilson, sitting in a far corner of the club, with his very scantily clad mistress draping herself seductively across him. I planned on having a few beers to watch just to make sure, but before I’d finished the first they’d both gone to the ladies bathroom, not very discretely, and returned in various stages of undress a few minutes later. I had uncovered that the good doctor…was having an affair…not planting the Ebola virus in the nation’s water supply or some more sinister act.

I returned home, twenty dollars poorer, and out of ideas. It was late and I immediately decided to just go to bed; I was scheduled to meet with one of my new professors at the hospital in the morning. I calmly entered my apartment and sat my things down in their usual spots, but something seemed off. It was hard to describe at first, but it seemed like things weren’t exactly where I left them. I just had a feeling at first, until I entered my bathroom and saw my toothbrush in the actual holder. That was a carryover from when my ex moved in with me before she decided that bodybuilders were hotter than book nerds and left me high and dry. I hadn’t put my toothbrush anywhere but lying on the counter for at least a year. Suddenly it was in the holder.

I grabbed a bat, because I’m too cheap to own a gun and apparently a steak knife from the kitchen didn’t make sense at the time, and began to search for an intruder. Last time they just destroyed everything I owned basically, so why they were so sneaky this time completely baffled me. After a VERY thorough inspection that included randomly throwing back dark curtains and dropping to the floor to quickly look under furniture, I determined that I was indeed alone in my small apartment.

I wasn’t entirely calm, so as I finally collapsed into bed I leaned the baseball bat against my nightstand just in case. I had just dozed off when I heard someone talking. Instantly I was awake. Like a baby giraffe taking his first awkward steps into the world I leaped from the bed, grabbed my bat and fell quickly to the floor in what can only be described as a belly flop onto carpet. I could clearly hear someone talking in my kitchen. I wasn’t sure who or what they were talking about but they were there. It sounded like English, but I could pick out a distinct British accent.

With the grace and poise of James Bond, if he had indulged in a few too many martinis (shaken, not stirred), I used my iPhone camera to show me what was around the corner to my small kitchen without actually poking my head out. I could see a small man in a lab coat seated at the table, staring directly at my outstretched hand. I quickly took a photo and pulled the phone back. The photo showed nothing, except that there was now something lying on the table. 

As I tried to figure out what it was I was startled by a noise in the attic. It’s a squirrel. I know it’s a squirrel, because he’s been there for weeks, probably eating my insulation and chewing on wires while the complex refuses to do anything about him. At the time, however, it might as well have been Beelzebub himself. I immediately jumped around the corner and realized that I was now completely exposed. Only, there was indeed no one sitting at my table. There was a small slip of paper. Written in jet black ink were the words “Worry not from whence it comes, but rather for where it goes.” I had nothing. Google turned up nothing, my common sense turned up nothing, and I had nowhere else to look. And so I slept. Clutching my Louisville slugger. Sitting in my recliner. With every light on.

In the morning I woke to the sound of hail beating on my windows. The paper was gone; I’d folded it into quarters and placed it in my pocket, but somehow it was still gone. I thought maybe I’d dreamed the entire episode until I remembered the toothbrush and the bat, the latter of which I was still holding. More eager than ever to leave my apartment I quickly got ready to meet my new professor at the hospital. 

He drove up in a pale tan Dodge Ram that was probably older than me, and looked like a mountain man through and through. Only when I heard him talk did I realize how incredibly intelligent he actually was. His knowledge of virology was incredible; he actually taught my former professor, the one who had passed away, and had made his mark on the Ebola virus as well; his serum was currently being used to treat the two Americans who’d become infected. Well, it wasn’t his specifically, but without his work it would be several more months before the serum would’ve even been ready for an experimental treatment, let alone two cases.

He was the kindest, grandfather-like person I’d ever had the chance to meet, and explained to me the steps I’d need to take to graduate more clearly than anyone had in the past. Even though I knew pretty well where I was headed, it was nice to hear it from someone with authority; he was the graduate advisor for my university for thirty years before entering semi-retirement. As we were finishing our coffee and about to part ways he looked me dead in the eye and said “It’s good to know where you’re going. Take care.” He walked away and I couldn’t help but think of the message I’d been left.

Back to the lab I went. The doctor in charge of the lab was a stern looking man in his late fifties. He had the look on his face that said he’d done some things, and seen some stuff in his years, and he made sure that policies in the lab were followed to a “T” regardless of the circumstance. Today…something happened. One of the hazard bins slated for incineration was left in the “clean” hallway between the patient’s room and the lab. The doctor had a fit. He fired the tech responsible for the error on the spot. I believe he realized how hot-headed of a mistake this was when he found that no one else in the lab had the credentials and experience to take a bin of highly contaminated sheets, clothes, and other articles, down for incineration. I did, so I volunteered. After a quick, but thorough interrogation he had me suited up and ready to go in minutes.

I’d done the same sort of work back in Africa, so it didn’t seem like much to me. I was happy to earn brownie points with the doctor, and I needed a break anyways. Once down in the secure disposal pickup area I waited for the truck. It was scheduled to arrive any minute; hence the irate reaction on the part of the doctor. After a brief wait the red light finally lit up and the doors opened revealing a small, but secure looking delivery truck. It had enough room for four or five such bins in the rear, but there was only one; mine. 

The driver stepped out wearing a protective suit very similar to my own, and took the forms to sign. He asked where the regular tech was and I, while trying not to bash the guy, informed him that he’d been let go. The driver grimaced and nodded as he took the paperwork to his truck. His passenger got out to take the bin. As he wheeled it away I turned around to leave when I realized that I was missing one signature. I ran to the driver before they left and he apologized, signing it while sitting in the truck. As he did so the passenger reentered the vehicle. I got a look at him through the suit. My heart stopped. I had no pulse for a few seconds; I’m sure of it. The man showed me the same weary smile that was on his face in the medical tents in Guinea. His eyes were bloodshot and bright red. The driver handed me the forms, shut the door and drove away before I could utter a word.

Through my research I knew which hazardous waste disposal firm was contracted by the hospital. I had to follow procedure or I’d be at risk for infection, so I quickly changed out of my suit and properly disposed of it. I showered off and told the doctor in charge that I was going to lunch. He nodded, looked at his watch, probably thought “10:45 is a little early, but sure, your call,” and I almost sprinted to my car. On the way to the waste disposal plant I hit 95 on the freeway…attracting the attention of a state trooper who I’d barely had time to see. I quickly got off on the next exit around a bend. I only had time to see him turn onto the interstate before the exit came up. I’m sure he got me, but he either didn’t see me exit, or decided that there were bigger fish to fry.

I actually caught up to the truck at a railroad crossing; apparently mile-long freight trains are good for something. The truck was the first car and I was about thirty cars behind it, but I could see it. Once the train passed the crossing I weaved in and out of traffic as best as I could to keep pace with the truck. Finally I saw them turn down the road to the disposal plant. Only…it wasn’t the main entrance; it was a dirt access road that was probably only used for maintenance. There was no way for me to follow directly without being seen. There was no gate, which was probably a breach of some sort of security protocol seeing as how they were disposing of hazardous materials onsite, so I waited a few minutes then tried to be as discreet as possible as I drove down the road…throwing up a massive cloud of dust in my wake. There was nowhere to turn around; the left side of the road abutted a pond of some sorts and the right side was thickly overgrown with trees and other vegetation, so I came up with the “I was lost and couldn’t turn around” excuse in case I was stopped.

At the end of the road was a small garage. I parked next to it and looked around for the truck. There were tracks leading inside but I couldn’t tell whether or not they were from today. There was only one window that I could see but it was about eight feet in the air so I had to pull my car over and stand on the roof to see inside. The truck was inside and the rear doors were open. There was what looked like a freight elevator and then nothing else. Suddenly there was a dull thud inside and the room began to fill with fog and droplets began to form on the window glass. Before it completely filled the room I was already back in my car tearing down the dirt road. I didn’t know what happened, but if there was any sort of explosion involving the incineration of Ebola tainted refuse I wanted to be anywhere but there. I briefly thought of alerting the hospital, but…like I said…alerting the proper authorities didn’t go so well for me last time, so I returned to the hospital for the rest of my day. I didn’t know what else to do.

Back in the lab I found that my new professor had taken over a small ring of students and was giving what appeared to be an impromptu lecture on the virus. He was reassuring some of the more skittish students that an outbreak in a more developed country, such as America, would be less devastating because we have better quarantine protocols, more sterile conditions, a more reliable blood supply, and, chiefly, Ebola is spread via direct contact; we know that and can avoid it in treatment much better than someone with no medical knowledge treating a sick relative. I listened in, but was too preoccupied with what I’d just seen to really absorb any of the information. 

Afterwards, he pulled me aside and noted that I looked like my mind was somewhere else. I answered that I’d just found out one of my cousins had been in a car accident over the weekend. That wasn’t entirely untrue; my cousin was involved in a fender bender the previous Sunday causing her to fracture her foot in three places. He looked at me briefly and seemed about to leave it go until he spoke again.

“I know where you went.” He said simply.

“What do you mean?” I replied shakily.

“It doesn’t last as long in the form of mist, but it’s just as effective. I hope, for your sake, that you were outside when it happened. Wouldn’t want to start a panic now would we?” He answered as he turned and slowly walked away. He seemed almost apologetic about it. 

My heart stopped for the second time that day. I immediately took a full decontamination shower and went home. As part of the program our blood was periodically tested to ensure that there were no contaminants escaping the secure confines. I quickly drew and tested my own blood using one of the kits. It came back negative. I’ve taken a personal break from school; my classes don’t start for another three weeks in the fall. I have myself quarantined at home with enough food and water to last another month or so. This happened last Friday. I have just over two weeks left to be sure.

Over the summer I spent about 8 weeks designing, building, and programming a miniature substation with multiple relays and protection schemes and functioning breakers. I put a lot of time into it and if I could count it as senior design credit it would allow me to graduate this spring '15 instead of summer '15.

2dgkgl,10,2014-08-13,Ignorance isn't really bliss,confusednotdazed22,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2dgkgl/ignorance_isnt_really_bliss/,"So I work in an office building. I'm kind of a temp or intern, or whatever you'd like to call me. I frequently refer to my position as ""office bitch"" as whenever something goes wrong, or there is something unpleasant to take care of, ""somebody"" has to take care of it so that the day to day operations can remain smooth for the actual workers. I happen to be that ""someone"". Seeing as I am still in school, I really have no problem working part time in an office setting because it gives me experience for my post-graduate hopes. Other than a few grouches, most of my coworkers see me as equal and will take time out of their day to say 'hello' to me and ask me how my day is going, so its hard to complain about working here.


Anyways, other than the random shit that I deal with on a day to day basis, my only daily responsibilities are doing the mail relieving the front desk lady for her hour long lunch break. Up until yesterday, I was entirely satisfied with my current position at the company, but after what I saw yesterday, I'm seriously considering a new line of temporary work. I walked towards my daily position at the front desk a 1 P.M. and began to lurk through reddit posts and answer the occasional phone calls. The building that I work in is 4 floors with an open atrium so that you can see all the way down to the bottom floor from the balcony of the three top levels. We are on the top floor, so I can frequently hear what is going on throughout the building at all times. 


Being at the front desk gives me a rare opportunity to see who is coming and going at all times so I can usually say off of the top of my head who is currently in the office and who isn't. Since I sit at the front desk from 1-2, its not unusual for people to be coming and going frequently for their lunches. There is only two ways to get up to our office in the building; the front stairs that go up the atrium to each respective floor, and the elevator for the more lazy worker bees. 


So there's this woman at my office, we'll call her ""Julie"", a beautiful middle-aged accountant. Sure, she's probably about 15 years older than me, but man is she beautiful. My only issue with this woman is that not once in my 4 years of working here has she bothered to even bat an eye at me. I mean, I've always assumed that maybe she had caught me checking her out, or maybe she was just a bitch, but for whatever reason she has never bothered to say a word to me, until yesterday.


Most people go out to lunch together in bunches, usually entire departments, but never Julie. On the rare occasion that I would catch her going to or returning from lunch, she was always alone, and has literally never gone out to eat with her fellow accountants. Yesterday, as I sat down to relieve our receptionist, I noticed Julie walk down the stairs, just as 1:04 struck the clock. She wears these shoes that make a distinctive *click* as she walks on the marble flooring in our building. Our receptionist caught her and said ""Hey Julie, do you want to go grab some lunch today? I'm on my way out now"". By the time she had finished her sentence, Julie was down the stairs without a response. Our receptionist turned to me and rolled her eyes; ""weird one she is, huh?"". 


""Yea, I don't think I've ever heard her speak, I wonder what her deal is"" I replied.


""Oh well, I'll see you in an hour, I'm going to go grab some food"" she said in passing as she made her way down the stairs. 


I began to make my rounds around reddit, and then the internet when I was interrupted by the same *click* *click* of Julie's unique shoes about ten minutes into my shift. I could hear her making her way through the lobby before she began her ascension to our floor. ""That was a short lunch"" I told myself. About thirty seconds later, she had made it up the stair and made eye contact with me. This was a rare occasion, something that had literally never happened. For a brief moment I thought she was going to say something to me as she opened her mouth as if she had something to say, but she closed it and began walking towards her cubicle. By this point, I didn't really think anything of it, just typical, weird Julie. For such a weird, antisocial woman, she was truly beautiful; her brunette hair, her perfect body, her bright blue eyes. Still not weirded out, I continued surfing.


Only about five minutes later, my surfing was once again interrupted. *Click* *Click* *Click*. They sounded exactly like Julie's shoes, unlike anyone else's that I had ever heard. But it couldn't have been her because she just came up the stairs, and I would have seen her go back down. I was eerily comfortable despite hearing the sound of her shoes for the next thirty seconds. This comfort was shattered however, as I once again watched this beautiful 35 some-odd year old woman walk up the stairs. Before I was able to question what was happening, I was completely caught off guard, as I heard the noise of something that I had never heard before;


""Hey Joseph, how are you today?"" she said with a beautiful, huge grin on her face.


I stuttered for a second just like any other guys when they are speaking with a gorgeous woman and spat out;


""Nothing much, just your typical Tuesday""


She giggled and responded, ""I asked **how you were**, silly boy, not what you were doing"".


This was such a strange phenomenon that I had no idea what to think of it. I felt pretty damn stupid for sounding like an idiot, especially since it was the only time she had ever spoken to me. She maintained her smile as she once again walked towards her cubicle. Our mini conversation distracted me from the strange fact that she had **already** come up the stairs. I was quickly reminded of this fact when another ten minutes passed and I once again heard the *click* *click* in our atrium.


""What the fuck is going on?"" I kept thinking because there was no way she could have gotten passed me twice, let alone once. I anxiously waited for thirty seconds, fixating my eyes on the top of the stairs, waiting to see her once again. Then she appeared.


""Hey Joseph, how are you today?"" she said once again in the exact same tone with the exact same grin that she had a few minutes prior. 


At this point, I was less caught off guard by her beauty and more by the strange events that were happening in front of me. I thought that I was losing my mind. This time though, I nailed the response;


""I'm doing well, Julie, its very nice to see you"". Her grin disappeared at turned into something that I cannot explain. Her face didn't necessarily convey happiness, but it didn't convey sadness either. She didn't appear angry or frustrated, she just held a bland look on her face as she approached the front desk. 


""You know, Joseph, I've seen you looking at me before"" she said with the plain look.


""What are you talking about Ms. Julie? I mean you're a beautiful woman, but I would never disrespect you like that""


""So you don't find me attractive?"" she said with a crooked eyebrow.


""Of course I do, I just....""


""You don't have to be so nervous, I enjoy younger men"" she said.


Is this really happening? I thought. I've daydreamed about this for so long, there's no way. She's never even spoken to me and now she’s flirting with me?


Before I could finish my thought, I watched as Julie's made direct eye contact with me. Slowly, her beautiful brown hair began to fall all over the receptionist’s desk. It started out with only a few pieces, but after about 2 minutes, she had stood there and not moved a muscle as every last hair fell off the top of her head. During this time, I tried speaking to her, asking her if she was okay, but I was met with a silent, blank stare. 


“Julie, are you okay? Do you want me to call a doctor? Please let me help you”


She seemingly snapped out of it and returned to her cubicle for the third time, this time with a bald head, as my confusion continued to afflict me psyche. *I am going crazy, this is ludicrous*
For all I know, I was going crazy, and the only thing that I could use to prove my sanity was the mass amount of brown hair from Julie’s beautiful head. The hair no longer seemed beautiful; it just seemed regular and disgusting like any other piece of hair that you find that isn’t yours. I quickly scooped it all up so that I could show somebody and explain that Julie isn’t well. After gathering it, I placed it in a bag that I found in the receptionist’s drawer, and then placed the full bag back in the drawer so that I could show it to our receptionist, the coworker that I trusted the most.


As I finished bagging the hair, I got a phone call. I answered in typical fashion; “Good afternoon, EPI Company”. 


There was a pause. 


The receptionist spoke; “Joseph, I am going to be a little bit late, I am stuck behind a car accident, I hope that I am not holding you up.”


“No worries, there isn’t much going on, I’ll see you when you get back.”


Thankfully, nothing strange happened in the next hour as I waited for her return, and I didn’t see Julie again, but I was getting anxious to show the receptionist what had happened to Julie’s hair. When she finally arrived, I had my hand on the drawer handle like a trigger finger ready to fire. She looked different, concerned, and pale. 


I pressed on with my plan and opened the drawer; “You’ve got to see this, all of her hair fell….”


I was cut off by the receptionist; “You know that car accident that I was stuck behind?”


“Yea”, I said in a confused manor.


“It was Julie. I saw the fire department remove her from her car. It was completely mangled. It looked like a head on collision. I saw the paramedics taking her out of the car and putting her on a stretcher, she was so bloody that I only recognized her by those shoes that she always wears”.


When I looked down, the bag was there, but there was no hair to be found. Not trying to sound insane, I kept what I had seen to myself, that’s why I had to post here, I had to tell *someone*, *anyone*.


Not an hour later, there was a company-wide email sent out informing us that Julie was pronounced dead on the spot in a head on collision with an 18-wheeler at 1:06 P.M. We were informed that she didn’t suffer, and that in-office counseling would be offered for the next few weeks and that the office would close early for the day. Like everyone else, I didn’t think that anyone was close enough to her to be affected by this tragedy. She was a quiet, lonely, self-sufficient loaner that didn’t talk to anyone, but man was she beautiful. I still do not know who or what I saw, but I’m not sure that I want to find out.

But before I was an engineer I was an intern.  And if there's one universal truism it's this: interns are the instrument of chaos.  This is MY OWN tale of tech support where I ended up as the stupid user.

As an intern I worked in the verification department debugging fire panels and fire panel networks.  The big fire panels that can handle detection, alarm, and security events for an entire multi-story building.  

Anyway, as luck would have it, we received a brand new batch of computers.  It was my job to install Windows 2000 on them which was pretty much new at that point.  So I went to the MSDN library, picked up a copy of Windows, and started installing it.

ERROR

Well, OK...let's look at the system settings which are probably conflicting with some specialized network hardware we had installed to communicate with the fire panels.  A little Lycos-Fu, a little guesswork, start install, and - VOILA! - 

ERROR

Now it's back to basics.  At this point I pulled the chip for the network cards and reflashed it with the newest firmware.  Then back to the configuration menu to remap things, a little more guesswork, start install, and...

SUCCESS!

I did this for the other computers then left a little late for the day.  Tomorrow I would be ready to finalize software install of our network applications.  I felt like a king!

A feeling that was quashed the next day when my boss nearly had a heart attack from laughing so hard while trying to explain to me that I was supposed to install Windows 2000, NOT Windows ME.  You see, all the applications we developed in-house were supposed to run on Windows 2000.  But in my haste to show a good job, I had installed the mother of terrible operating systems.  I had just picked up the CDs saying ""Windows"" without checking to see whether the version was numerical or alphabetical.

Still, I did earn plaudits by successfully, and for the first time, installing Windows ME on our specialized computers.  Variants of people joking about Windows ME made it onto our ""Haiku of the Day"" board until my last day.  A day in which my coworkers had conveniently installed Windows ME on my computer as a going away present.

TL;DR: Tried to take the belle of the ball out to dance, turned out she was a pumpkin."

I am currently in a finance career I do not enjoy on any level whatsoever, and the pay is rather dismal.  However, my coworkers are nice and it is a 'tolerable' job, with some propects of promotions in a few years.  I have been applying to coding bootcamps and have been accepted to two of them so far.  I have enough cash saved up to be able to pay for tuition, but I will need to move back home with my parents.  Furthermore I am about 15k in debt to family members due to a health problem I suffered this year.  While they are not hounding me to pay them back immediately, it does not feel great for me to be indebt for this amount of money to family.  

I currently work a 9 - 6 job, but with the commute it is more like 6AM - 8PM every day, leaving little time for me to practice coding outside of weekends.  

I have a minor in CS and studied code academy and other online resources on my own time.  Based on this experience level, how realistic would it be to be able to learn what I would be learning in a BC, while working full time with my schedule?  How long would this likely take me while working full time? 

If I do choose to go the BC route, I am expecting to do internships or be unemployed for a few months unless I get extremely lucky.  How long would it likely take me to gain a full time position that pays a respectable salary?

2dhobt,16,2014-08-13,A bit of advice for new FYE students,[deleted],Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/2dhobt/a_bit_of_advice_for_new_fye_students/,"There are many ways to describe Purdue's FYE program. The following are my own thoughts after being in the program during the '13-'14 year.

FYE is pretty much a tool used by the university to demoralize new engineering students to the point where anybody who isn't serious enough about becoming an engineer will drop or fail out of the program. I'm not trying to tell you to give up or be discouraged, but be aware that your FYE courses shouldn't be taken lightly. Purdue is a great university, especially when it comes to engineering, so be prepared to be challenged as some of the world's brightest students.

A few rules you should follow: be sure to create a balance between your education, health, and social life, as hanging out with friends and getting exercise are important supplements to, but should not replace, valuable study time. Attend (and be sober for) every lecture, lab, and recitation. Go to office hours, start assignments early, be serious about your team projects, and above all, get 'enough' sleep. I failed to follow most of these rules during my first semester, making my freshman year both stressful for me and unimpressive for internship resumes.

Again, I'm really not trying to discourage you. Even when college gets tough, keep in mind that you were accepted into Purdue's engineering program because they know you are capable of succeeding here. If you find yourself struggling, there are many on-campus resources for you to take advantage of, whether you're struggling with a single class, time management, or some deeper personal issue. Just remember, your college experience depends completely on what priorities and decisions you make.

Good luck!"

This means I am the only one in the building with any computer knowledge. This is a horror story about a manager whose massive ego was only rivaled by his incredible level of technical ineptitude.


One of our high-level managers, let's call him Steve, asked me to set up a spare office downstairs for his son to work in as an estimating intern over the summer. He needed a workstation, 2 monitors, mouse, keyboard, power cables, ""internet cable"" (Steve felt it necessary to detail every item individually, because apparently I have never set up an estimating workstation before. Plot twist: I have.).... 


Steve also (strongly) suggested that I use the old, clunky laptop that was sitting in our conference room that we use to throw PowerPoints or spreadsheets on the projector. It can't really handle anything past that, and I know it. Steve, I soon realized, already had the entire setup planned out in his head, and he was really just being ""courteous"" by offering it as a ""suggestion."" A few days before this, I had just finished cleaning up an almost brand new laptop that we got back from an employee that resigned. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that ""old clunky"" wouldn't even load the estimating software our company uses, much less be able to interpret drawings and do takeoffs/bids.


&gt;Steve (rambling): ...keyboard, power cables, internet cable (wut?), you know, all the usual stuff.


&gt;Me: Right....are you sure you want him to be using that old laptop? I have that brand new one back from $former_employee, and it's running Windows 7 (old clunky had Vista). It would be super fast to put $estimating_software on there and get it set up downstairs.


&gt;Steve: No, we need to use old clunky. (Funny how they always say ""we."") It already has $estimating_software on it.


&gt;Me: Well, it hasn't been used for estimating in years, and the software is probably several versions old. It would be just as fast to do a fresh install on the new laptop as it would to update old clunky.


&gt;Steve: Let's just use old clunky. I think it will be fine.


*Queue internal frustration*


&gt;Me: Okay. I'll get it set up for him.


I'm still considered more of an entry level guy; I have only been here a couple of years and most of the employees have been here for 10 or more, therefore I can't really argue with decisions like this. I figure I will just set it all up the way he wants, then he can't be mad at me when it doesn't work, because he was the one that wanted it set up like that. Right? *Right???*


I spend the better part of a day cleaning old programs and files off old clunky, and updating the estimating software. Since this isn't technically part of my day-to-day job, I just have the laptop off on the side of my desk and I'm clicking ""next"" every now and then. Steve pokes his head into my office several times to see how it's going. (This was the middle of the week, and his son didn't start working until the next Monday.)


*Frustration intensifies*


After getting old clunky as clean as I could, I set it up to Steve's exact specifications in the spare downstairs office. I also set up Steve Jr. as a user in the network and gave him access to estimating related stuff on our server. I pretended to be Steve Jr., logged on, opened up the estimating software, grabbed some files from the server, etc. just to test everything he would possibly be using. It all worked, so in my mind, I was finished with this little project. *As if.*


*Monday morning 8 a.m. Steve calls my office.*


&gt;Steve (angrily): Can you come down here? Steve Jr.'s computer is totally locked up. We can't even turn it off.


*Frustration, which had dissipated over the weekend, comes rampaging back in a fiery manner*


&gt;Me: Be right there.


I go downstairs to see Steve hovering over Steve Jr.'s keyboard *smashing* keys. Literally, he was forcefully smashing things on the keyboard like a pathetic, 120-pound version of the Hulk.


&gt;Me: Uhh, so it's totally locked up?


&gt;Steve: Yeah. Not responding to anything. All he did was open a drawing set in $estimating_software.


*And it locked up? No kidding!*


&gt;Me: Well, let me take a look at it.


I take the driver's seat, and end up having to completely power off the laptop and restart (Steve had said that he couldn't even turn it off, but that was because he wasn't holding down the power button, just hulk-smashing it several times). After boot-up I try to open $estimating_software, just to make sure that's what actually caused the lockup since I didn't see it happen the first time. This infuriated Steve.


&gt;Steve: I told you that's what locked it up the first time! See, there it goes again. What a piece of crap. Let's just get $former_employee's laptop down here and see if it works.


&gt;Me: Well, we actually just sent that one out to $former_employee's replacement in Texas. (Steve knew that we had hired a replacement, but was too busy running around drooling in purple pants to realize that we would send that same laptop to the new guy)


&gt;Steve: Great. Well I guess I will just have to order him a new workstation. He can help me in the meantime.


&gt;Me: Okay then.


I was too scared to ask if he wanted me to use the spare machine we had in our computer graveyard. I figured since it's his son, he doesn't care about dropping $1,500 on a computer that's going to be used for 2 months, especially considering his position in the company. He ended up picking out a very nice workstation (probably cost $2,000 based on the specs) which I had to spend another half of a day setting up while he and Steve Jr. hovered over me watching every cable connection, switch flip, and key press. I don't know if you guys have ever had management-level people stare at you while you work, but it makes a 3-hour setup feel like 12 years.


Yesterday was Steve Jr.'s last day, and I've been told to ""put his computer in storage."" A barely used, $2,000 rig collecting dust while half the estimators are running Vista because they ""can't afford the downtime that an upgrade would cause.""


I need more coffee.


**TL;DR  Non-tech savvy manager assumes to know more about workstation setup than IT guy. Causes IT guy to lose almost 2 days of work that could have been avoided if manager had listened in the first place.**"
2dhyp9,6,2014-08-13,Need advice regarding a check-fraud incident that occurred 3 years ago.,roboz08,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2dhyp9/need_advice_regarding_a_checkfraud_incident_that/,"Hey reddit,

This is my first post. I figured this would be the best online resource to ask for assistance/help.

Without going too much in to detail, I was living in NJ three years ago doing an internship. During this time I rented a room in an apartment from a guy through craigslist. Long story short, we didn't get along as room/housemates, and he agreed that if I found a new place, he would refund me half of the total amounts rent upon moving out, which I paid in total up front because I figured I'd be there the entire time with no issues. Big mistake, I know. Lesson learned. (I was only planning on staying there for 3 months). So, I found a new place, was set to move out and he left me a check for half of the total rent cost on the kitchen table.

The check bounced. Mistake number two that I made was moving out before the check cleared my bank account, assuming that it would indeed clear without any issue. 

The check was for about $1,500. I don't remember the exact amount because it was a few years ago and I've done my best to repress this awful experience ever since then. 

I reached out to my former roommate shortly after the bank notified me that the check didn't clear for an explanation. He basically told me to go to hell and that I'd never see the money again, and that he was glad that I was finally out of his apartment.

I went to Newark Police, they told me take him to court. I went to Essex County courthouse, and of course, this asshole didn't show up. 

Basically after that, nothing was done, and I was told that nothing can be done. over time, I've learned to move on. As a young 20 year old naive college intern, this was a very depressing experience that I went through. My parents were very disappointed.

But, fast forward to now, after logging on to facebook earlier today, my former rommates's name came up on ""people you may know"", and it lists the location of his current place of employment. I'm wondering, can I do anything with this information in an effort to receive the money that is owed to me? Shortly after the incident took place three years ago, I did research and found out that what he did to me is considered a felony. It is a form of cheque-fraud that is known as ""paper hanging"".

It would bring me a small bit of closure to know that something was done and justice was served to my arrogant, entitled former roommate.

Thanks."

This position seems amazing, but it's extremely hard to get a job at Palantir (they've had the hardest technical interviews I've been through). Are there any other jobs like Forward Deployed Engineer in other companies? Are there any CS related jobs where I'd feel like I'm making the world a better place? I'm very open to all sorts of companies, from startups to nonprofits. I know this is a very generic question, but I thought it'd be worth asking. I'm going into my last year of college (I might extend it to do another internship) and am starting to get worried that I'll end up doing something I don't like.

I've posted this before a few months ago in another subreddit, but I thought it'd be nice to get some more feedback about this"
2dibms,1,2014-08-14,I can only get shit done when I hate myself.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2dibms/i_can_only_get_shit_done_when_i_hate_myself/,"People say that being insecure makes keeps you from doing the things you need to do, but for some reason it's the only thing that motivates me.  When I'm happy, confident, and ok with who I am, all I ever want to do is hang out with friends and have a great time.  I become a bit of a hedonist.  I get lazy, I procrastinate, I get fat, I spend too much money, and my career stagnates.  

I'm trying to get myself motivated to make positive changes in my life, and I'm finding it difficult.  Right now I'm moving to a new city and getting a new job, and I want to start fresh and be a better person than I was in the old city.  I want to be cleaner with my space, I want to eat healthier and exercise, lose weight, and be active socially.  I'm finding it difficult to muster up  the motivation to make life changes.  I say I want to eat healthier but I just went out to eat junk food twice today.  What is wrong with me?  I have no self control.

So I tried to think back to when I was able to accomplish things, and I realized that every time I've ever done anything difficult was when I was at my lowest, and hated myself.  That self-loathing was my motivation.  

When I was in college, I graduated with a difficult degree in a shorter amount of time than most take.  I did it because I was insecure about my intelligence, and I felt like everyone hated me because I was so stupid.  So when my adviser told me not to take more than two upper-level classes for my major at a time, I took five.  I felt like I had to.  I felt like if I couldn't do it, I was too stupid to deserve to be in school, and I might as well resolve myself to being a hobo for the rest of my life.  It was a miserable point in my life, and I was very depressed, but I graduated with decent grades much earlier than anyone expected.  And I did it while still maintaining a part time internship.

When I got fat after college, I hated myself.  I'd look in the mirror and want to vomit, and I'd tell myself every day that everyone hates me, because I'm too fat to have friends.  I was miserable, insecure, and pissed off a lot of people who had to listen to me trash talking myself.  Then I lost 10 pounds in a month.  My goal was to lose 15 pounds, but after 10 I was so proud of myself that I stopped hating myself.  I became happy, and shit stopped getting done.

Most recently, I went through a short patch where things were rough.  I went through a big breakup, and a year later the guy got engaged, while I was still getting rejected a lot.  He used to nag on me about how I wasn't ""moving on"" with my life, and while I never wanted marriage or babies young, I realized that I needed to move on.  I got super insecure about how so many people I graduated with left town and either have families or great better, fancier jobs than me in better towns.  It made me horribly depressed, so I applied to a few places and got an offer for a job that I can be proud of, in a bigger city.  The job is my dream job, and I'm really excited to move, but I never would have done it if I was happy.

The downside to all of this though, is hating myself really sucks.  It puts strain on all my relationships and friendships, and sometimes I'm just too happy to hate myself.  Right now, things are pretty good.  I'm confident, happy, and secure with who I am.  I'm back to the weight I was before I lost the 10 pounds, and I know I need to lose it again.  This time though, I'm not as bothered by being fat.  I mean, I'm still within the ""average"" BMI range, albeit the upper end, and besides, my happiness shouldn't depend on how I look.  I still want to lose weight, though, and I'm not finding the motivation to just do it.  It's not just losing weight too.  It's everything.  I can't improve myself without hating myself first.  And honestly, I'm just too happy to hate myself right now, but I really want to improve.

So is there a way to motivate yourself without the self-loathing?  I also like having a social life, and I don't like how being depressed affects how I act around other people, but being happy and confident makes me way less productive.  How can I channel that motivation without the downsides?

Also, apologies for the wall of text for what is arguably, a really stupid problem.


TLDR: Hating myself is the only motivation to improve myself that works.  How do I motivate myself without having to be miserable?"

2dihqg,3,2014-08-14,"I feel underpaid at my ""internship"". How should go about getting a raise?",Hoodiesarewarm,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2dihqg/i_feel_underpaid_at_my_internship_how_should_go/,"**Update: So I guess my concerns were already addressed by my mentor who was a consultant hired by my company to help out. He already spoke with them about changing my title to Digital Marketing and raising my pay last week. I just haven't received the news yet and only found out from asking him whether I should ask for a raise.** 


A bit of a background:

I'm a bio major with html/css, java, photoshop, dreamweaver, illustrator and major web-based tool backgrounds. But, seeing as how I've been taking bio classes all my undergrad career, I tried to apply to some marketing internships for this summer with little luck.

Luckily, I did manage to find an internship with a small local company who needs someone to basically be the whole marketing department for them. So I soon found myself going way beyond the basics : analytics, adwords I have to do design stuff for their emails and websites, web development for any changes needed on the website theme and much more technical things. I'm their marketing, email, web dev and graphic artist all at once. 

Don't get me wrong, I learned so so so much. But what I don't like is how they blame me for every little thing that goes wrong even when it's not my fault. For example, there was an image used on an email that was looked over by my supervisor and approved by him; however, this image featured a product that wasn't part of the promo presented in the email. Of course, I got the blame for picking wrong pictures. Other times when the site isn't working, then they immediately point fingers at me as if i broke it because I have the ability to alter the template. And earlier today, my boss basically threatened me to give him the psd files of something I made even after I told him I don't give out psds for personal reasons. He originally wanted the psd so he can hire someone to add it to a location on the site which I did for him anyways. 

So I get paid $10/hr for all this work while my peers who are doing excel work get at least $15/hr. They recently just hired a full-time marketing guy who is going to be doing the content work which means I still have to do all the technical and designing and he gets paid much more than I do for the same things and less skill. 

I'm going back to school soon and they expect me to continue the internship during the school year. How should I go about getting a raise especially since i'll have to juggle all this with school work now?

**TL;DR**  My internship pays me $10/hr to do marketing, email campaign, graphics design, web development and doesn't show much respect or appreciation. School is starting and I'm expected to continue, so I'd like a raise. "

The thing is, the two test are on Java(one titled 'Advanced Java' and the other 'General Java'). Would I be able to learn enough Java in a couple days to score decently on these tests? 

Also, the position posting did not require applicants to know any programming languages, just the desire to learn C#, ASP.net and other related web technologies. 

Now, I do have a basic knowledge of the general syntax and structure of java. I have only taken one introductory programming course so far(Python) but throughout this summer I have taught myself how to implement algorithms and data structures to be ahead for my Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class I will be taking this fall.

2dkcy3,20,2014-08-14,I think my friend is trying to copy my life...,live_my_life,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2dkcy3/i_think_my_friend_is_trying_to_copy_my_life/,"Hey, /r/nosleep. Something has been on my mind for a while these past few months and I can't shake the feeling that my friend Kristen is a little *too* involved in my life. There are many more instances than the ones I describe below, but these are the ones that most stick in my mind. 

But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll start with some background. Kristen and I became fast friends about 12 years ago when we were both in junior high. We liked all of the same things and were interested in a lot of the same books, movies, music, etc. 

She grew to be taller and larger than me, and had blond hair the fell to her shoulders. I was on the shorter side, with a slight build, and long, rich brown hair. We were inseparable in high school. I fell in love with a boy named Gary before my senior year and after Kristen had gone through a pretty bad breakup that year, so I introduced her to Michael. Fast forward 5 years and we're both still with our men, both engaged to be married. Gary and I are getting married next May, and Kristen and Michael will be married next July. We are both going to be bridesmaids in the other's wedding. 

But these last few years? I don't know... something feels off. She's still one of my best friends, but Gary is starting to notice it, too, and I'm glad I'm not the only one. 

When we both left for college, I majored in accounting and she majored in engineering at different colleges. I had considered engineering, but it sounded like a lot of hard work. I wanted a good balance in my life between work and play. Kristen felt differently at first, but after her first semester, she transferred to a college close to our home town and switched her major to accounting now as well. 

Fast forward a few years and I landed a very promising internship with a large company that paid very well. After my first internship, she also sought out an internship at the same company. She got the position and needed a place to stay, having never lived in or near my city before, so I let her move in with me. All of these other similarities aside, they're admissible as us just being close at this point. But this is where shit gets really weird. 

I walked down through the basement where Kristen's room was to get to the laundry room. I noticed my gray and pink sweater hanging to dry. It was weird, because I hadn't done my laundry that week. I walked over to the sweater to investigate. It was a large, and I wore a small. Kristen had bought the same sweater that I had worn earlier that week. I shrugged it off as a compliment at the time. 

A few months later, she dyed her hair. She insisted that she was tired of being treated like a dumb blonde, so she wanted to become a brunette. 

Before I graduated college, my firm sent me a job offer to work for them full-time. I very gratefully accepted, excited that I wouldn't be too stressed looking for a job like many recent grads are. Kristen also received an offer, started six months after I did, and was finding a place of her own. I was happy for her, and began to notice a trend when she got the job offer. She's engaged to a guy that I recommended to her. She will begin working at the firm that I recommended to her. She had begun to buy the same clothes that I had. She dyed her hair the same color as mine. Were all of these just weird coincidences? Or should I accept that part of this was my doing, as well? I was the one who had shown her all of these things after all. I tried to put it out of my mind. 

But still, all of these odd things keep popping up. She asked all of the same friends I did to be in her wedding. We have the exact same bridal party, except she had just met one of the girls through me, and barely speaks to the other, any more. And one of the girls? Years ago, when Gary and I were getting serious, I asked her if she would sing Ave Maria at our wedding as I walk down the aisle. I told Kristen this idea a few weeks ago, and before I knew it, she had posted on the friend's wall on Facebook asking for her to do the same at her wedding. After the friend had had a long discussion with Kristen, eventually she backed out of her wedding as a bridesmaid. She shot me a dirty look at lunch the next day and said to me, ""she said she's only doing your wedding because you forced her."" I mean, what are you even supposed to say to that?

When I try to invite other people out, Kristen always tries to invite herself to our dinner or to our bar to be with people whom she has never met, but who are always friendly enough to allow her to tag along. I even wrote on a friend's wall on facebook, ""happy 21st birthday! I'll be in town this weekend so I'd be happy to take you out for a few drinks!"" Not even a minute had passed before Kristen commented on my post, saying, ""I second this offer! Can't wait to go out with you two!""

A few days ago, after declaring that the new vehicle I had purchased wasn't her style, she confided in me that ""wow, in person your car is actually really cool,"" and ""I think I might get one.""

Gary even pointed out to me yesterday that at Kristen's new place, she had bought furniture that was eerily similar to ours. I didn't believe him until I went over there myself. I thought I had walked into my own house for a second before I realized that that was not our rug, and the room was not the same shape. For sure, though, that was our couch, our coffee table, and our TV stand.

But I've got to be out of my mind, right, /r/nosleep? Maybe it's just because I've been lurking on this sub for too long so everything seems odd, but her actions are starting to creep me out. It very well could just a weird feeling I'm having. What do you think?"

Firstly, I want to thank everyone for their advice on my issue. I really do appreciate it guys. I have already quit the position and will be dedicating my time on personal projects. To look on the positive side of this, I think that in the past few weeks I have learned more on my own than I would've in an actual college course. I began iOS development and Objective-C about a month before I began the so-called internship and I've done the internship for another month. I absolutely feel more comfortable with iOS which I have learned all on my own in the past 2 months than I do with Android and Java, in which I took a college course in. Not only did I learn about development but I also learned quite a bit about UI design and database management. 

As one of you redditors asked what it had said in my contract about payment, it stated (""Payment to the intern will be provided by the employer as the employer sees fit based on intern performance""). I'm sure this is enough grounds to sue the damn company. 

So a few tips from a fellow college student to other college students looking for their first internship:

Here are 6 legal requirements for internships (as provided by /u/terminalcomputer:

* The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment.

* The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern.

* The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff.

* The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.
* The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship.
* The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Also:

* Always remember to thoroughly read the contract and if you're looking for pay, make sure that the contract covers this part.

* Once you read the contract, make sure you discuss things with your employer and get everything cleared up before you begin doing your work.

* Do not sell yourself short. Even as an intern, you can be a helpful part of a team. Seriously, you have a skill that not many have but many are looking for. Know your value as an employee. 

Thanks again for the advice you guys, this has truly been a learning experience for me.

I just wanted to know from someone with experience in the industry or someone with knowledge about interviews/offers/etc what I can do to increase my chances of landing a job (as an analyst) at one of these economic consulting firms (Analysis Group, Brattle Group, Charles River Associates, Compass Lexecon, Cornerstone Research, NERA, Berkely Research Group).

My reason for asking is I know that I'm not a top tier candidate. But I have the demanded breadth requirements:

-A Economics degree (Honors) from a Ontario University with at 3.2 GPA (weak point, I believe). 1 Failed course. 

-Senior Research thesis completed with 91% grade.

-2 Summer Research Internships. Good reference letters.

-Good knowledge of all the hard skills (excel, STATA, office, etc.)

I understand university recruitments for 2015 start in September, however I graduated this June (2014) and want to begin applying/reaching out ASAP. I have a few connections (don't mean to sound like an elitist) in at least half those firms I listed. So someone is available to at least give me an introduction to a senior consultant/VP.

What else can I do to increase my chances? OR is it naive to even apply?

Any advice is appreciated.

I have an interesting decision to make. I can either take 17 hours/18 hours for fall 2014/spring 2015 and graduate or I could do 12 hours/12 hours/11 hours and graduate in December 2015. The latter option would allow me to work a research position in the fall as I would have time. And it would also allow for an internship in summer 2015.

I currently have 2 internships under my belt and I am going to a career fair with a lot of big companies in October. The recruiters going to be there are AirBNB, Github,Google, et cetera. I would like to get a position at one of these companies, but I am not sure if I am qualified or not. I feel that it'd be easier to get a spot as an intern and I'd then have the research position on my resume.

Gist of my resume: 3.6 GPA, no personal projects, 2 internships, comp sci @ a state school. 

Is the gist of my resume good enough to get a spot at one of these companies? Or should I get the research spot on my resume and delay graduation to maybe have a better shot at an internship?

Lastly, with the increasing growth of successful scripted web/streaming series (House of Cards, Under the Dome, etc\) - why do you think the online streaming companies haven't produced their own reality shows considering how low the production cost is vs a scripted show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk9zs/iama_reality_tv_producer_ama/cjqf1c7?context=5)|Pointers for someone with an idea for a show who has been approached: make sure that your intellectual property is secured and you know what the role/position of the person who is contacting you is at their company.  Pointers for someone who has been approached to be ON a show: Go for it! But think about the angle of the show. Being on a dating show probably wouldn't help you, but being on a ""business makeover"" show could be great exposure for your business.  First day of filming for talent? It depends on what the shoot is like. Let's say you're a business owner doing a show about the business... There will be a camera crew following you. The producers may want to see you ""getting ready for work"" or something like that, in your house. There may be an engineered event like ""getting coffee with your employees"" where you talk about ""the objectives for the day"". The producers might have clients lined up to come into your business. If you're a cake shop, they will have clients with unique requests already ready to come in. If you're a salon, you might not know which customers are real or not. It all depends on the setup.
 |The A/C repair shop next to the Pawn Stars shop in Vegas got significantly increased business after that show became popular, and they aren't even in the show. Just their sign in the parking lot. So even being next to a reality show can be beneficial.  And the web is a huge threat to network TV programming, but nobody from the reality world has really stepped over to producing reality programming for streaming or the web. It all comes down to finding the finance or crowdfunding a good idea and developing it well.  I think that people would love the kinds of small-budget niche-audience things that could be created.

 |I dropped out of college in LA to pursue entertainment careers. It wasn't my plan, but I ended up meeting a lot of people who had interesting problems that needed to be solved for production. ""How do you find all of the ___ in Alaska?"" ""How could we find a family-run ___ that sells ___?"" ""What's a good way to get in touch with people who ___?""
 |Solving problems like that is the fundamental material of a producer's job. You have to be able to do anything at any time and come out with a decent answer. What kind of boat is needed to carry 4 crew and 380 pounds of equipment in turbulent water? What insurance policy do we need for that? Is it better to shoot this shot with an aerial drone or a crane or a boom?
 |Basically I just worked on figuring out answers to those sorts of things as an unpaid intern, and would offer to do any work that was needed so that I could learn about it. Legal contracts? If I offered to read them for typos then it mean I got to learn about how they work. Casting calls? Meant that I got to talk to cast and sort them out and present the best ones to whoever I was working for.
 |Internships are pretty cutthroat in hollywood. People will deny that you worked for them because ""they don't use interns"" and stuff like that. But I found that by interning for tons of people that I got access to valuable information and used that as leverage to get paying jobs.
 |Basically if you work for people who are in a good position but are incapable of keeping up with their own workload then eventually you get to move up and gain visibility with whoever else they work with. Maybe that's a boss, maybe that's a producer for a show, maybe that's a network executive.
 |Pretty soon you become everybody's secret weapon and have a good all-around skillset.
 |I love my job, but there are dry spells and I don't want to be a reality producer forever.

For example, which brother in the family is the one that everyone brings their problems to? Which employee is most likely to get stressed when someone else isn't doing their job? Which person pays more attention to details? Which one of the friends is the one that tries to get everybody to get together and do something fun? Which one would sit at home if nobody invited her? Etc.
 |I would just look for casting notices, many of which are on places like Craigslist, for local things. If you live in Texas and on Craigslist you see something looking for ""Family-Run Businesses in Texas"" or something like that, it's probably a reality show in development. Also, work on knowing anyone in your area who is at the peak of their social network.
 |I know that when I look at certain areas, I try to get to know certain people who know lots of other people, so that I can act through them. It all depends on what city or state I'm looking at.
 |Gallery owners in SF know lots of artists. Event planners in LA know a lot of actors. Photographers know a lot of models. Club promoters know dramatic party girls. Party girls know rich guys. Rich guys know business owners. Business owners know publicists. Private investigators know law enforcement officers. Ex-military know current military. Etc etc etc etc etc.
[What current or past ""reality"" series was the most ""real""? Have their been any shows out that actively try to limit any added production (conflict, dialog, staging, etc.\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk9zs/iama_reality_tv_producer_ama/cjqccr3?context=5)|This is somewhat controversial.
 |I can't specifically point at any shows as being ""more real"" because the level of actual reality changes from season to season usually.
 |Build shows are usually never on the timeline they say they are. ""Built in a week"" sometimes means ""built in three weeks by people who aren't even on the show."" Other times it actually means the cast built it, but not in a week. Other times, it was actually built in a week.
 |Dating shows are very very structured. Maybe two people are having some chemistry, but the producers are guiding things or exploiting the actual chemistry. Most of those shows fall upon the format of the show to carry the storyline.
 |Flipping property shows are not always accurate, but I am not an expert in that area.
 |I have been told that some of the home makeover shows are done in ""a week"" or ""three days"" or whatever they say on the show, and actually are done that quickly.
 |Cooking shows are very real, from my understanding. The subjective parts of the judging may or may not be influenced by the producers, but the food is real and is cooked and probably tastes great.
 |Paranormal shows are a chaotic mess, that can go towards reality or fakery depending on the cast and whether or not they believe they are ACTUALLY PSYCHIC GHOST FIGHTERS. There is sometimes trickery of the cast, and sometimes the cast is (trying to) tricking the producers. Sometimes a location is trying to trick the producers and the cast.  Paranormal shows are some of MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES to watch, and I've developed a couple to specifications for production companies, but nothing ever went to series. Very very very fun.
[What's your story that led to your involvement with the reality tv business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk9zs/iama_reality_tv_producer_ama/cjqbrz6?context=5)|I have to be a little bit vague here... Hope that's okay.
 |I dropped out of college during the recession, found out that lots of internships were available in entertainment, then realized that no paying work was available for someone without a lot of experience.
 |Mainly I got into the awesome challenges in reality production and development. There is a lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes that doesn't involve making people argue or getting them drunk and making them fight. I've always been fascinated by complex systems and the internet and technology and scripting and etc. and I got a chance to flex those muscles in TV work.
 |But then you can't find paying work...
 |So you start interning for free for as many people as you possibly can. Eventually they want to show off how good their unpaid labor is to other more important people, and then those people try to poach you. In this fashion, you can end up working for many many people. All of a sudden you are paid zero dollars, but you have information on multiple networks development needs, you've worked on a bunch of projects, and you have the information from ""behind the curtain"" of development.
 |I used that as leverage to get paid work in a variety of positions. Used that work as leverage to get work in other areas like film and indie movies and stuff. Then used what I learned there and brought it back to reality TV. Lather rinse repeat.
 |My approach was different than anybody else I've met, and I think that's why I got to be a producer before I was thirty. I'm still not thirty, BTW. lol.
 |The real question is how do I LEAVE reality TV?
[How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk9zs/iama_reality_tv_producer_ama/cjqbp0h?context=5)|As a 3rd-party development producer, if I license a show to a 2nd party (production company) and a 1st party (network), I can be paid anywhere from a couple grand to much more than that per episode in the case of a series order. For a pilot or a nonairing pilot I'll make a tiny bit of money.
 |If I'm staff on somebody else's show I typically get paid a consulting fee which covers working for that show for a certain amount of time (maybe ten weeks of production, or ""two weeks of preproduction"" or something like that), but that doesn't mean I have to spend a certain amount of hours on the work. So yeah I can get paid stupid money for a few hours of work.
 |When you look at people like Thom Beers, Simon Cowell, David Hurwitz, etc. they are usually making money as both producers of the show AND making money from having created the format. Basically the bigger your name is and the more shows you've sold then the better you'll be paid when you license a show.
 |Look at Simon Cowell's income, for example.  He mainly has formats that are licensed to other countries. He can negotiate for ad revenue, contingent compensation, merchandising rights, episodic fees, etc. in each country producing one of his formats. People in his position have a lot of leverage.
 |So yeah I get paid pretty good money for pretty easy work. I am not always employed on a show in a given month, so there are dry spells.
[What are some of the shows you've been a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk9zs/iama_reality_tv_producer_ama/cjqawfa?context=5)|Unfortunately I cannot be specific, because there aren't too many reality developers who work freelance and it would be easy for someone to determine who I am based on the shows and positions.

They all sound fun, but I have very limited time (I changed into CS in the middle of college years), so I can't try them all. I had an internship during summer which was very tangentially programming-related, but got to see many graphic programmers.


How do programmers usually find their passion? So far, I am really into OS related topics, software development, and general software engineering from managerial perspective. Sorry for being vauge, but I would like to ask more specific questions, yet I just don't know what to ask because I don't know what are available for me."

I definitely know i want to do embedded system design. I love messing with microcontrollers and FPGA boards and I consider myself a pretty good programmer. I've been EE declared but thought of changing to CpE because all the concentration classes are related to embedded systems and VLSI design (plus a few CS classes.)  
  
The classes not required in the CpE program are controls and Signals II (Edit: also Electromagnetic engineering and Circuits II.) I feel like these classes could be more important as they lead in to a lot of concentration classes for DSP and Controls, including some embedded controls class.  
  
DSP is also something i'm very interested in. So I'm trying to figure out if i should stick to EE and take some Controls and DSP courses and continue to learn CpE stuff on my own / through an internship. Or if i should switch to CpE and to the same thing in reverse.  
  
Or i might be overthinking everything and just pick something and take an internship that works with DSP/Controls and programming embedded systems.  
  
Any advice?"

This is my second internship and at a big company. I had one previously, but it was more of a sales engineer position with very little technical and engineering involved.

I'm currently half way through my second internship. I started off strong and tried my best to become familiar with the company and what they do. I asked a lot of questions and shadowed other engineers besides my mentor around. Everything was going great until I got my internship project.

My internship project was focus on data analysis. I thought it would be simple and fast since I have done a lot of lab work at school. But, it has been a complete nightmare. It's been over four weeks and this data is killing me. They want me to look for patterns and explain any oddities. And, I absolutely can't find any patterns or reasons for the oddities. I told my mentor and he told me to keep trying.

I investigated the data more and gathered more information from other people, but it proved to be futile and didn't really give me any good conclusions. I feel like a complete failure because the other interns who started at the same time I did are doing perfectly fine and making progress on their projects. One already finished his project! And, I feel like a complete failure. I feel like my mentor is really frustrated with me too since I'm having so much difficulty with this project. It doesn't help I'm the oldest intern there and I feel like such an embarrassment right now.

As of now, I'm still trying to figure out my data and I feel like giving up. I look at the same data every day and cannot find any reasoning or patterns for why it's like that. My mentor keeps telling me to try to figure it out, but I can't. I'm running out of ideas on what to do, and I'm freaking out because I don't want to seem like someone who can't do anything. I feel like I'm becoming an annoyance to my mentor and everyone around me now."
2dm8uy,2,2014-08-15,I'm sorry I just need to vent some shit.,buisness_potato,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2dm8uy/im_sorry_i_just_need_to_vent_some_shit/,"   It is 4:00 in the morning. I am tired as shit. I am not falling asleep. I am in New York. 
   I am here because my dad likes to travel, he likes to take me on his trips, and I am incredibly shitty at saying no to people. I know I should be thankful I get to go on a metric ass-ton of great trips, but it is just to fucking many trips. 
   We're taking this trip because we're moving my sister out of the apartment she's been living in for the summer while she's doing an internship. 
   As soon as I got here I realized that my dad does not need me here at all, as my sister owns around five things. Despite that, I was not asked if I could help out. I was told to go, not knowing about it until the day before we left.
   This is what makes this trip so particularly annoying to me. This trip was immediately following another trip I took to move my other sister into collage. The main differences here were: 1. They absolutely needed me there, since the only ones there were my mom and sister, who are both tiny people, whereas I am fairly strong. 2. This sister owns many, many things. 3. I was politely asked if I would help, a few weeks in advance. 4. It was a two day trip for a 12 hour drive, as opposed to the trip I am on now, which is a week long trip for a 3 hour drive.
    Now after I got back from that trip, I was tired, since me and my mom had just completed a 12 hour drive back home. It was only a few hours after we had gotten home that day that I found out that I would be flying to New York at 
*4:30 the next morning. 
   Now, I am very introverted. And I am also sixteen, and very fond of jackin' it. In case you have not yet connected the pieces of the puzzle I've given you, than I will tell you now that when you spend 6 days either in a car small room or **crowd of people with one or more members of your immediate family, you do not get to jack off. You do not get alone time. 
   The alone time I am using on typing this is only available to me because my dad and sister are asleep right now. Each one not more than five feet away from me. They of course are both sleeping on mattresses, where as I am sleeping I the tiny-ass couch. Why? Because I am an idiot and I volunteered to take the couch. 
   So tomorrow, (if I manage to get to sleep) I'm going to wake up, be seen as a lazyass teenager by my dad because I didn't get up at 6:00am to ***run around the city, despite the fact that all summer I've been going to unreasonably early swim practice at 7:00am and then equally unreasonably late swim practice at 7:00pm (they are each two hours long). 
   Then I'm going to get in the way for a few hours while attempting to help take my sister's shit down a remarkably narrow staircase, so I can sit in a car for three hours reading the worlds shittiest book. After that I am going to help move my sisters shit into a house, go eat some seafood (that's the part of the experience I'll enjoy) and go to bed. 
   The next three days, I'm going to be doing basically random shit my dad has planned. 
   Then me and my dad will fly home, only to arrive at an ungodly hour, fall asleep, wake up, get literally all of my school supply shopping done, jack off, go to bed, wake up and go to school. 
   This may be the worst part about my dad's dumbass decision to stay so long. I am finally getting home with literally **one day** before school starts. 
   Anyway I think I'll wrap this shit up and attempt to fall asleep again.

**I mean no offense to New Yorkers, but how the hell do you live here. There are way too fucking many people. Like, how have most of you not just spread out throughout the state yet?

***Running, in my opinion, is about as appealing a choice of exercise as a powersander is appealing a choice of tool used to perform a circumcision.

I have a lot of catching up to do since I am a junior, but I have a strong foundation in C, C++, Java, and scripting in MATLAB and Python.

Anyway, I love all of the languages I mentioned above. Developing small tools and pieces of software is a lot of fun. Theory, algorithms and whatnot are great too.

Anyway, over the summer when I get home from my internship I have been working on learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Man, I think these are the most boring things ever. I just really dislike web development, and I don't think any amount of money could ever make me want to go into web development. To me it just seems like I am doing menial labor... But to each their own right? I am not a creative person but I could see someone with a background in design or someone who is creative being a very good web developer.

Anyway, my question is this: Do I need somewhat of a web developer  background to be offered software development positions? Like do I need to know HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc for technical interviews? I live in the Bay Area and plan on working here if that matters!"
2dn8qy,115,2014-08-15,Full Department Panic,JimmyKillsAlot,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2dn8qy/full_department_panic/,"Hello and Welcome to Part 3 of my best and worst job, all while a college student in my Junior year (and to think this all started as cross between a student worker job and a school sponsored internship).

Now on with the show! As before I will have some markers; for those who want to skip to just the juice without the patience to squeeze.

***Epic Length starts here, a bit more pivotal to the story than usual but if you want to skip then just look for Long Length or Medium Length***

Shortly into the summer session, just a day after the last final, we received confirmation that student workers could be given full 40hr work weeks IF they were enrolled in fall classes already and they wanted to. The majority of the bugs from the previous payment rollout had been taken care of and the calls had even dropped off, and best of all I had been able to finish adding in the credit cards for the people who wanted to opt in from our old payment setup. 

Things were calm. 

That is never a good sign.

Week one, schedules were finalized until the summer session started and everything through the summer had been signed off of; well almost everything. Monday morning I am called into my boss’ office immediately after sitting down at my desk (didn’t even have time to log in).

&gt; Boss: Since it’s summer and people take vacations we are going to do some system upgrades this week; new servers, new lines, all that good stuff; even said something about an extra rack, not sure what that’s about.  
Me: Ummm okay, but we have a round of courses starting next week.....on Monday  
Boss: That’s fine, all I need you to do is write up an email telling people they will not be able to log in from 9pm to 6am Wednesday-Thursday and Thursday-Friday.  
Me: Err....We can’t take down the site for any part of Friday.
Boss: Why not?  
Me: Friday is when the next round of teacher certification courses will be posted. 

He just nodded and picked up the phone. You see, the group had started as an offshoot of the Board of Education in our state, to make it easier for teachers to renew their certification; they started broadening targets when other state departments wanted to get in on the system and threw their own money at the project. Because of all of this we knew one thing above all else, teacher recertification registration was the MOST BRUTAL of any of the registration periods. They were posted every three months and there were always limited seats. Teachers had a year to get signed up for a course or they had to go through a very long and drawn out appeal process to get another year. All of this meant that from the early morning hours of 4-5am until 8am, we would see up to 1/6 of the teaching force in the state (and sometimes neighboring states) logging into the system and refreshing the same two pages over and over until 6am when the new cert courses were posted. 

Boss off the phone with our techs.  
&gt; Boss: Okay we are bumping it to Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  
Me: You mean we gown down tonight for 9 hours, then tomorrow and the next night for the same?  
Boss: That’s what the guys want.  
Me: I...okay, so you want me to write the email and tell them they have 12 hours before our first down?  
Boss: And send it to me first for approval.  
Me: I should go then.

He nodded and back I went to my little cube to draft an email to notify users of outages less than 12hrs away. 

***Long Length, trimmed and ready for the real fun. If you want just the juiciest part then skip on to Medium, but don’t say I didn’t warn you!***

Email written, email edited by boss, email approved, I tell our crappy in-house program to start making blocks of users and sending them the alert; subject: “Site will be down for maintenance” Body: “We are doing upgrades! From Monday 9pm to Tuesday 6am, Tuesday 9pm to Wednesday 6am and Wednesday 9pm to Thursday 6am access to the site will be unavailable.” I had warned my poor team about the email and upgrades, warned them we would be getting more calls and emails from users; I however had not been prepared or prepared them for neither the deluge nor the bigger storm on the horizon.

Now I will be honest, we all know this should be a fairly easy thing and needing three 9 hour blocks to do it seems a tad unnecessary for what is still a smalltime operation, but this is the result of two very stupid policies that came about from the payment system fiasco; the first, all new “things” had to be tested before the user can access them and after they are implemented, the second (expanded from an older rule), the data for a user’s account can only be stored in one active system at a time which someone interpreted to mean they could not even copy the user files over while we were online. That’s right, all the cloning was going to be done right then!

Here come the calls and the angry responses. Now the site did not host the courses, per se but in order to access them they had to log into our portal then use ours to navigate to the courses site which would check the login. So of course all these people were now very upset that they would have their courses unavailable for several hours during the night, when many professionals had time to actually work on them... Users were not happy and the clock had just reached 10am.

I helped field calls, checked to see how much I had as discretionary funding, (new month means it’s back up to full), ask the team (who are there from open to close that day) what they want, order lunch. The day is spent apologizing and making notes for every angry customer. 

**Day 2: Tuesday**

I had been asked by the boss to go straight to his office when I got in. Inside I was greeted one of the server guys who was already seated.

&gt;Boss: Okay quick meeting on how the first night of upgrades went.  
SystemsGuy: Took all night but we finished with most of the capacity swaps.  
(I’ll be honest, I missed exactly what he said because I was half asleep, it was only when my mind clicked on what wasn’t mentioned that I responded)  
Me: Wait... (cutoff)  
Boss: And tonight?  
SG: We move everything to the new hosts.  
Me: So the user accounts, the registration system, etc.?  
SG: No that’s the night after.

I linked a few times in stunned silence, bad enough the most annoying part was not done day one but you are waiting until day 3?

&gt;Me: Then what are you.... If you don’t mind me asking, who made this call?  
SG: My boss and I decided it would be best, that way we could focus on just condensing two into one.  
Me: And how long have you been doing this?  
SG: 2 Months.  
Boss: Well you are a valuable member of your team. If you run into any trouble your boss has my phone number. 

And with that we were shuffled out. I tried to tell him they should really start on accounts but he gave me a “I got this, no worries” then pulled out his phone and walked away.

The day was spent similar to the first, people who were angry that they didn’t get the answer they wanted yesterday, people who were angry because they missed the email yesterday, people who were angry things were not ahead of schedule. 

Lunch time. Hey team, Pita? Pita. 

Closing time, exhausted, it’s Tuesday night and the week from hell is just getting started.

**Day 3: Wednesday**

Site down until 7:30 ugh.... well not terrible I suppose. 

More pissed phone calls and emails; pizza? pizza. 

**Day 4: Thursday (insert dramatic music).**

***Come in here for medium length, pretty much last stop***

Last night was the final down for the site, right? Get in at 8am, phones are already lighting up and no one is on shift until 9 (when we open). I login, look over the email account, lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of emails... Oh dear.

Everything can be grouped into three categories:

1. Same problem with the site being down as the last two days.  
2. Can't log into account at all.  
3. Can log on but can't do anything/lost information.

I start calls early, myself while simultaneously trying to get my boss on the line. I try my account and the admin account, neither can access anything but can log on. 

Finally the boss is there, tell him what is going on, he conferences in the Systems guy

&gt;Boss: SG, why can no one log on?  
SG: Well transferring accounts took longer than anticipated.  
Me: I tried to warn...  
Boss: We told you this would take a while, how long did you plan for?  
SG: We started at 4 this morning.  

The boss let out an exasperated sigh, asked me if I needed to get back to taking calls and I gladly hung up. About an hour later he called back, they were still working on trying to fix the problem but were giving excuses like file types not matching properly. A coder was able to put up a “Site unavailable” type message on the front page and we spent the day trying to calm people and tell them their instructors were already informed.

I’m thinking Subway? Guys? Cool! They deliver now. 

Day 5: Friday

5am: Cell goes off; it’s the boss. He’s pissed and frantic also maybe a bit pissed. The site is still down and people are waking up to get their registration on. I try from my home computer; well I can go directly to the login page... my account still works.... I try to register and.... crash, every error imaginable; sorry not just you bossman. SG is not answering his phone, neither is his boss, we are SOL. He hands up and calls the coder in a long shot then calls me back, Coder will see what he can do. 

We both wait until he texts to try now, errors change but the pages are still down:  
 5:45 am; well at least the new servers are handling the lag.  
6:30 am: I can feel the hatred and screams from the people trying to register inside my apartment; I am certain someone placed a gypsy curse on us that day.  
7:30 am: Head in early and find the boss at a computer taking calls, he looks stressed. I join him.  
9:00 am: The student workers are in for shift, they are prepped with the worst news possible.  
10:30 am: Site back up, login returned, accounts working. All course information missing.  
12:00 pm: Pizza ordered, already in progress courses returned, courses not started are still missing, registration still down.  
2:00 pm: Pre-registered courses returned but still no registration, average wait time has been 35 minutes all day due to inflated influx.  
4:00 pm: Calls start to taper, we only have so many users. Still no registration page.  
5:15 pm: Close for the day. The boss is pissed but extremely impressed with everyone.

&gt;Boss: Who has plans for Saturday night?  
Random SW: My parents are coming into town for the weekend.  
Boss: That’s fine, anyone else?  
Boss: Good, okay JimmyKillsAlot will get you all my address, everyone is invited to my house for Steak and Lobster on Saturday, 6pm sharp. Bring your S/Os, you can bring your parents too, we’ll have enough for everyone. You guys did the best I have ever seen under such stress. And even if I am arrested for killing SG, I’ll tell my wife to have the party anyway.

He laughed and walked out while we all sat there stunned before someone else burst out laughing. The registration page was still down but everyone knew now. 

We all had a nice surf and turf meal, the one SW earned a lot of points with his parents that night. I watched emails over the weekend, responded to a few and by Monday the problems had been corrected. Basically the copy paste only grabbed part the account information the first time and when it grabbed the next part it could not figure how to attach it to the correct spot, or so I was told.

***Epilogue:***

We got new policies regarding hardware upgrades.  We got a new systems team. Everyone got a 50 cent raise. They debated adding an outside call center, I left before that was every decided on (bureaucracy can do wonderfully slow things). Registration was pushed back a week and everything went fine then.

Throwaway account here.

By the end of the year I'll be graduating in computer science. I had a 1 year experience working as a software developer, but I don't really want it as a career. For the last 2 years or so, I've been working as a research intern at a laboratory in my Uni.

My plan was to get a masters degree here in Brazil and then apply for a PhD in Europe or North America. But lately I'm a little worried if that will actually be possible and how long it'll take. Plus, I've been getting more and more interested in jobs that require more physical effort rather than intellectual. A bit crazy, I know.

On the other hand, my family on my father's side has german roots. I believe I am 1 generation off to be able to apply for the citizenship. Although if my father was to get his, I think it would be possible for me too.

(mostly because I didn't care much for what I was learning and didn't put the necessary effort in - ""C's get degrees"" type of attitude)
Over the last 2 years at school and my summer internship experiences at a tech startup, I've realized that computer science and programming would be something that I could really like and excel in.  I'm very detail oriented, tech savvy, enjoy problem solving, and prefer putting in a lot work on something and coming out with a tangible reward (instead of analyzing things or doing busy work with no outcome).

I've recently started reading up a little on CS and taking CS101 on coursera and I really enjoy it, so now I'm at a crossroads...  I want to go back to school and learn CS in a more rigid academic setting.  With little to no CS knowledge I'm not sure what type of degree I should go back to school for (I know this may be a stupid question)...


TL;DR  As a graduate in a different field with basically no CS knowledge, would I pursue a Masters, Certificate course, another bachelors, etc...?

**Where I am right now:** 
My TL;DR story: nerdy HS kid that got into a really good college. Realized how much fun partying and drugs were, and failed out. 

I'm getting my life back together. I scored an internship during my time of college doing basic data analysis for an IT organization, just excel and VBA. I quickly realized that I was wasting my time and life and that I could do a lot better. I maintained a good relationship with my counselor and was readmitted to Uni to finish my degree (B.S. in Math, Concentration in OR and Statistics)!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Where I want to be :**
I am scared I have permanently messed up. I am going back to Uni. with a cumulative GPA of 2.5. During my time off, I realized I will never be the best at Math or Computer Science, because I simply never committed to learning the material thoroughly and always did enough to just scrape by. 

That being said, I understand that I am young (21), and I have been blessed with a second chance. I am ready to work hard: I need some guidance getting together a game plan.  

I realized that my strengths are having a mix of technical skills (math, stats, some cs) and strong communication and teamwork skills. My hobbies are music and travelling. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ultimately, I want to do something that makes a difference in the world, no specifics yet. I realized that I don't want to have wasted my life being drugged out. 




After doing some research, I have found that 2 jobs might be good fits form me.

1. Consulting
2. Data Science

My specific questions for you are:

1. Are there any other career choices you could recommend I look into?
2. How do I deal with the low GPA, both these career options seem very competitive, and the second will require a graduate degree
3. Are there specific things I can do while I finish school to help get on track to start a career

I have some side projects that will be finished (an android app and a couple other things) but I am worried I will turned away and be made ineligible to apply again for another year if I even send in/hand out resumes to companies before my GPA is improved.  CS GPA is a 3.5 but I have been told that most companies are only interested in your total.

I really want to advance my programming to the next level and start cool projects, not just scraping together some code for a back-end system or a small part of a software program. Currently, I feel as though I know how to code ""like a programmer"", but lack the knowledge to implement difficult pieces of code. I also don't have much experience deploying anything with GUI or finishing a project start to finish, since most of the projects I've worked on have already been started by someone else, and I just help out with some of the backend code.  I feel a little overwhelmed with the depth and difficulty of information available.

**Location** Seattle

**Company Size** ~300 engineers

**Internship Compensation** 40/h

**Previous Experience** ~4 years over the course of school/internships

**Primary Role** Web Application Developer


I'm expecting to get an offer this next week, everyone on my team has praised me for the work I've done and I believe I have a lot of value to add to the team. Over the summer I've become the lead expert on my team for the technology stack that is going to be used moving forward over the next year for our new project. I've also noticed that a lot of the engineers on my team come to me seeking advice or input on a lot of issues.

Checking out salaries in the area and websites like Glassdoor I believe I will see an offer around 100k, it might be low balled to 90-95k, but with my current compensation I don't see it being any lower.

I feel like I have the grounds to ask for a higher salary based off of my experience and preexisting knowledge that I will be bring into the group. I've worked with the technology that is currently being researched to be used in our next iteration for 4 years now and have used the technology at other internships, while most of my group has only heard of it, but never really touched or used it.

My question is basically, coming from an internship position is it normal to seek salary negotiations? I feel like I'm worth 115k to my team and the company. If I want to try and get an offer at 115k, would I be asking for ~120-125k? "

I graduated from college 2 or so years ago and I'm somewhat debt free.  My parents and a scholarship helped a lot... 

So I should be totally ready to take on the world, right? I'm a rarity: I don't have to worry as much as everyone else and I feel extremely privileged.  Not much debt gnawing at my knees?  A pretty clean credit score?  All the time in the world?   Enter my 20's-- that stupid, confused part of my life I just want to be over.  

I thought I'd never have to deal with it.. since I knew what I wanted to be since I was 5 years old: someone who works in the animation industry.  My focus currently is on background art, character design, motion graphics, composting, flash animation (both character and motion graphics) and a lot of other crap.  And yet I can't seem to hold a job for more than a few months.  

After almost 3 whole years of minimum wage to barely-alive pay internships... I'm feeling really fucking burnt out.  One of the things I keep hearing is I'm ""overqualified"".  Or that I ""under sell"" myself.  I once had an previous boss say they weren't going to hire me because they ""didn't see my worth in the projects ahead, but was pleasantly surprised by my skills months later"" (only to not have the paycheck that matches).  Suddenly all the jobs I've been rejected from in the past year made a lot more sense.

Seems like everyone's able to accomplish their dreams but me, and I feel like I'm turning into a paranoid, crumbling mess.  I've switched off every bit of social media I can turn off.. except reddit and twitter.  All my 'friends' (I'll get to that) have moved away, gained so much popularity and skill far beyond what I feel like I can achieve in my current state.  I've had anxiety and depression problems since for as long as I could remember.  Was bullied for a large percentage of my life.  My personal problems grow bigger and bigger each day it seems.  I can hardly go outside without needing to run into a corner and gasp for air. 

 I can't stop thinking about money, I can't stop thinking about giving up everything.. my relationships, my obligations, my everything(s), just so I can start over.

Do I have friends?  Yeah, a few that I can talk to.  Again, most have moved no NY or LA and are generally very successful.  I'm still in Virginia, I live with my boyfriend.  He's my only close friend at the moment..as   I naturally push people away and it sucks.  Its the feeling that if I get close to people they'll see the anxious, paranoid mess I am.  And the flipside to that?  The people I love and care about the most have no idea I care about them so much.  They feel no need to confide in me, and I feel extremely lonely because of that sometimes.  

In closing, it's gotten to the point where I'm riding out the bit of money I have.  I don't know what the next step is.  It hurts so much to want to develop your skill and learn new things and HUSTLE my ass off.. but I can't do it.  I'm a scared, pussy of a wreck right now.  What can I do to move out of VA?  Break the news to my boyfriend?  Not be afraid of everyone and everything? 

I know it's a eyefull and it's a weird post sorry.

I am, by what most people seem to mean by the word, successful. I have a 3.9 GPA at a prestigious university. I have a lot of money in my bank account, which I have earned through various internships and scholarships. I will begin my senior year of college in a few weeks, and I already have a high paying job lined up after I graduate.

Yet, all of it seems meaningless. I don't enjoy any of it. I don't know what to spend my money on, since I don't really enjoy anything. I want to just give it all away. It means absolutely nothing to me, and most of the time I forget I have it.

I have no friends. I'm 21 years old, and have never had a girlfriend. I am a virgin. I was bullied throughout most of my childhood, and I have the scars to show for it. I've been depressed as long as I can remember. I can recall being seven years old and wanting to die. I really don't know how I've made it this long.

I turned 21 about six weeks ago. Every night since, I've drunk until I pass out. I usually mix it with sleeping pills, as well. I also smoke about ten to fifteen cigarettes a day. I like the idea that I'm harming my body. Every night, I hope that I won't wake up the next day. I'm always disappointed when I do.

I don't understand how my life is considered so great by societal norms. I hate every second of it. All I've ever wanted is a sincere friend, but I've never had one. Now since I know what it's like to be ""successful,"" I can say that there is no longer any reason to live, since I'm no less miserable than I have been my entire life.

And yes, I've tried therapy; I've tried meds. Nothing helps. I'm doomed to be forever miserable and alone. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There has never been, and likely never will be, anyone out there who sincerely cares about me.

2dpqy7,5,2014-08-16,Two Parts: Am I a Better Software Engineer than I Think I Am and Should I Take A Risky Position?,ThisThingCalled,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2dpqy7/two_parts_am_i_a_better_software_engineer_than_i/,"Part 1:

So I'm going to start with I'm not a ""veteran coder"" by any stretch of the imagination. I got my undergrad in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I had a software related internship in college, and found it pretty fun. When I graduated a few years ago (with the economy still reveling in ""The Recession"") I got an ECE job in QA. I hated it enough that I looked anywhere for a job, and my current position (C#, C++, and embedded development) looked like a fun change.

To start, I'm pretty happy here. My boss is pretty flexible and nice (if not always on the ball), the pay is OK (but not great), they only make me stick to a 40 hour work week, I get 14 vacation days a year...but in a company primarily composed of PHDs I don't think I have much of a chance to advance a ton. So it is a ""mixed bag"".

This position is pretty nice for a coder who is learning though. It is an RND firm, so we don't really make software ""products"" and focus on delivering one-off demos for algorithms. This means I'm developing a lot of theoretical knowlege about software design and low level syntax, but am not really developing any skills (imho) that a ""real"" sofware company would jump on. I mean, there are a few things, like I've helped implement a basic software process, coding standards, quality assurance practices, training, and took on a variety of roles including configuration management and ""Scrum Master"". (But in a company of scientists, I have no idea if I did a good job with this stuff or not). In addition, I occasionally I get pulled into projects that are not related to anything I would ever be interested in doing (Lets just say I've gone from ""terrible at solidworks"" to ""slightly less terrible at solidworks"" with the intention of ""never using solidworks again"").

So to combat the ""lack of developing skills"" i've started getting my CS Master's degree part time. This really takes advantage of the 40 hour work week, and will help me to get my next job.

But down sides of this job seem to outway the up for alot of the people that I've worked with that I really respected. They've all jumped ship. *The weird part to me is that they keep trying to take me with them.* I mean, I'm good, but in a sea of excellent programmers who've worked on successful products before and have completed their formal training, I'm not sure why *I* keep getting calls to move to their new company. And they don't just want me to code, but to lead small teams of developers.

Edit: To clarify, I've turned them down not because they weren't good jobs, but because I didn't want to move.

Part 2:

The latest position offered really has me baffled. The problem they are working on is very interesting (though super experimental). One of the managers that left (on good-ish terms, he was let go because the company decided to stop perusing the capabilities he was best at) contacted me. Hes run a few successful ""sold"" start-ups, and is now the CEO of a spinoff division. Hes trying to build this spin off division. A few bullet points:

- First off, I trust this guy. He did a good job as my manager.
- There is no one else on the team yet, which has me terrified.
- Pay is 15-20% higher (depending on how you do the math) and benefits are better.
- Advancement opportunities are going to be much better (Heck I know the CEO)
- Leadership position, developing the company's software process, supervision a small team

But terms like ""ground floor opportunity"" scare me. I also don't feel super qualified to do this job...I mean, I'll be building up capabilities that I've only been exposed to in classes. And despite his assurances, I know these positions tend to require throwing yourself into the job. I don't have any problem doing that, but I do want to finish my masters degree (plus I'm getting married in the spring with the intention of not waiting to long before starting a family) and I don't see how I'd be able to do that and work a 80 hour work week. And to be quite honest, if I was a coder with a degree in it and 5-10 (or even higher) years experience, I'd look at this 26 year old kid whose working on his masters and has 3-5 years experience playing in RND and be pretty pissed off that hes higher than me.

I'm a rising sophmore in college and attend a top 25 U.S. university with a decent engineering school. 2nd semester I f'ed up - went from a 3.55 GPA to a 3.0 GPA giving me a 3.29 for my freshman year. I did poorly in my advanced data structures class (C+) plus two math classes (B's). How much will this hurt me when trying to get an internship for the coming year? 

I ask about GPA screens because I don't think my grades reflect what I know and can do. I've won 2nd place at a decently sized hackathon, and completed a CS internship this past summer which is rare for freshman. Also, the CS class I messed up was because I didn't submit two weeks worth of homework (went on a school trip two weekends back to back which was a baaaad idea). Before we judge CS skills, On the CS tests, I placed 1-2 std.deviations higher than the average score (my final + 3 tests average out to a 92.5). Also, there were less than 15% freshman in the CS class (everyone else was older).

What should I do? My resume + class rigor/load + EC involvement + side projects indicate that I should be smart. Until I show them my transcript :p

I graduated this year from high school as valedictorian (4.0 gpa) and good scores on IB Exams which meant a good 2 maybe 3 semesters worth of general-education credit at my university (CU Boulder). However due to a slipup resulting in me applying late, they decided the merit (GPA and ACT) based scholarships didn't apply to me and as a result I would be taking on a lot of debt to go to college. It would be doable but silly. I would end up around 60,70k in the hole.

Feeling a little bit cheated and with decent prospects in applying for aid NEXT year with a better evaluation (still no merit awards), I'm very seriously considering a gap year where I go out and get a proper job in programming. I've been programming in Java since middle school and I'd call myself near fluent. I've familiarity in a few more languages. I interned at a startup last summer, writing unit tests on production code among other stuff because that company was sometimes a mess. I got a lot of support and praise from my coworkers who have since left the company and have provided a good, if small, network.

I have a linkedin account (new), and my short term plan is to start a nice commit history on github, finish out some personal projects, and create an app with code samples to point to. This would probably take near a month working consistently, but would create a pretty respectable resume. My understanding that outside of companies with an established corporate (degree-heavy) culture, I could land a job -- or at worst get an internship as a large labor market returns to college this August. If I adore the job I'll delay college -- or next year I return to school.

I know for sure that the first two years of my degree would be review at best, so it's hard to really agree to that right now considering how much I'd be paying to find out what a variable is.

Thoughts? Where do I move from here? Is my plan of action sound? Dire mistakes?

Thanks for your thoughts and advice."

Really need advice.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2dqamu/should_i_find_a_new_job_really_need_advice/,"I graduate this past May with a degree in CS. I had been applying everywhere the last few months of school to try to land a job, but not much luck. By the second week of summer I had a job offer and another interview that seemed like a lock to hire me. For reasons that are still unkown to me I never got that second job offer. I ended up excepting the first job offer reluctantly.   

This job payed like shit(Only about $1 more on an hourly basis than my internship) and I wasn't really interested in the job itself, but I was tired of the whole job search process and I figured a job was better than nothing. My plan was to work there for a year then see what my oppurtunities are from there.    

After working here for a few months I am not sure waiting that long is a good idea. Shortly after working here I learned that that it gets super busy at the end of the year. This means I will be in the office pretty much all day, to the point that they bring in dinner for us.  I was told there would be a little overtime  at the end of the year, but he forgot to mention during the interview that I would basically be forced to live in the office for a month  and get no extra compensation for that time. I have also come to relize this may not be a good chance to get exepriance. They hired a few people less than a year before me, so they get to do the interesting stuff, and I do the grunt work. I am also pretty sure I get payed a considerable amount less than my peers. I was hired to do something slightl diffrent than them, but I was trained to do basically everything they do.

Now I am thinking of just finding a new job. I wouldn't mind working a little overtime, but I feel lied to and I my current pay they canno't expect me to work those kind of hours. If I work those hours I will be basically making a Mcdonalds hourly wage. This job pays so poorly that basically any job I can find will be a 30% raise. The problem is that I don't know if this is a good idea and I feel kind of guilty. Would it reflect poorly on me if I leave my job only a few months after starting, and leaving them out to dry? If I leave it will make a busy time for them even worse, becuase they are understaffed and work their employees like dogs.   

**TL;DR Get a job that pays like shit, expects me to work a lot, and has little value to my career. Should I leave and put them in a tough position? Would that make me look bad? How do I explain this in a potential interview?**

During my high school days I contemplated suicide a lot, and even had a botched attempt when my roommate walked in on me as I was about to commit the act.


College on the other hand has been pretty great. I have a pretty good GPA, I'm heavily involved on campus, and I've done a couple of internships. This summer however has been absolutely awful.
I received a paid internship at a CPA office in my town and that job was supposed to get me through the summer. However, I lost that job when the CPA office had a mass exodus during my second week. A lot of people leaving, and the office eventually going out of business left me without a job.
This was really difficult on me. They told me not to get another job just yet, and that everything would be panned out. It obviously wasn't. My rent and car payment were approaching their due date so I had to pawn a lot of my items and I do mean a lot just to make the payments so that I could function.


I was able to find a job a little later in construction. I did rather menial tasks for a couple of weeks and everything seemed to be on the right track. I was also able to get my T.V. back from the pawn shop so I wasn't bored to death when I got home. After a couple of weeks on the job, I lost work yet again due to the contractor running out of it. I'm still seeking payment for one week of work in addition to everything, but he's actually a really good guy. It's just obvious that he has absolutely not work on his plate right now and is behind on bills. After I lost my second job I was screwed. I had to wipe out my savings yet again, and pawn things to make my rent and car payment yet again.

This is what led to the problem I have now. I was absolutely broke. I was scrounging up what I could just to fill the gas tank to look for jobs and eat, but I eventually ran out. In a horrible frame of mind I went to Wal-Mart stole an item worth $14 dollars and tried to return it for cash so that I could buy food. I don't even know what I was thinking, I didn't even try to pocket the item, I just walked up to the service desk. 


Needless to say I was caught, and Wal-Mart is pressing charges that allot to a Class A misdemeanor. Not only that, I'm banned from going to Wal-mart again which is unfortunate for a couple of my  organizations. Now I'm sitting here typing this out feeling like utter crap. I live in a small town, and when I go to court everyone is going to realize what I did. I still haven't eaten in a few days, and the town is so small that food banks don't even exist. I hate everything and I just want to get out of it all. All the problems coming down on me seem like too much, and on top of everything I have an electric bill 5 days past due and no idea how I'm going to pay for it. I hate waking up every day where my job is to find a job. It's just all too much."

I LOVE working here. Although the internship was paid($10/hr) I'm ecstatic to finally get a salary and benefits for the first time. I'm 27 and have a Bachelor's of Science.

I've heard from other interns that were hired that the base salary for the position is $45,000/yr, which I am comfortable in making and was the number I was looking for. I've never made even close to that, but it seems like everybody else just accepted the offer.

I've read on this subreddit that I should negotiate my salary, but could use some advice. I had a job offer from a smaller company in March, but it was 43.5K/yr.

Your help is greatly appreciated. This sub helped me keep my head up during my darkest days, and has provided me great information."

2dtcrd,1,2014-08-17,Question: Where should I look for evening (after 5:30) or night shift jobs?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2dtcrd/question_where_should_i_look_for_evening_after/,"Hello /r/jobs!

I am a student, who will be graduating with my first degree (Administrative Office Professional, 2 year) at the end of Fall term. My second degree (Psychology) needs about 6 more classes, but I can't finish it until I have full-time work due to expenses. I do not receive financial aid, I pay for school 100%. Due to my situation, my partner and I are going to be renting an apartment ASAP as we are in a very bad living situation right now.

My primary field is as an Administrative Assistant. I am currently working:

1)A paid (minimum) internship, 20 hours a week max during school year. This will last potentially through Winter Term.  

2)A weekend (slightly above minimum) Admin Asst job, 13 hours a week. Indefinite, small company and I am the only weekend worker. I can not get more hours here (possibility after I graduate, but very slim).  

Fall term I will be taking approximately 17 credits (this is fine, I promise. I've been pulling 20 credit terms with 3.5+ gpa to get a 2 year degree done in 1 year). This means I can't take on a full-time job due to my schedule.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I do not have a car, but I have a bike and legs (and can usually get a ride if I HAVE to). Smallish town, decent daytime transit system.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I need to increase my income, but my only available hours Fall term will be:

Monday/Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday 9:30 - 4 am  
Wendesday/Friday/Saturday 5:30- 4am  
Possible Monday/Wednesday 6:00 am-11:00 am.  

I am trying to find an evening/night shift job, up to 30hrs/week.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


So far I've looked into:  
 fast food (I will keep trying here, but I do keep getting the 'you're overqualified and therefore won't stay' line, which is somewhat true. I do have a possible 'in' as my current co-worker's SIL works at a local fast food and has let him know I need more work)  
  
security (limited in my town, I'd have to go to the next town over which isn't possible without a car, and I'd need to train, and I am female which isn't ideal in employers eyes), warehouses (again, next town over)  
  
taxi services (potential here, but in our town taxi's aren't popular so may not earn much).   
  
I'd like to pick up a bar tending job, but due to the massive student population they only hire trained people (understandable!), which makes it hard to get on.  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


What else should I look into? I'm beginning to dabble in online work, but I'll admit the taxes side of things is intimidating (Though, from what I understand you treat it as an independent contractor, which I have done before). Obviously, my schedule is limited which is a turn-off for many potential employers. I can promise a minimum of 9mths for any job I take, likely longer (yes, even if it's fast food. It doesn't pay well, isn't in my field, etc. But it does pay, and every bit helps)
  
Other details: City pop : ~54k, university town so lots of competition.

The team and company culture is quite awesome, and I would love to go back to the company. However, the scope of work the team does is limited to developing Android APIs, their implementations, some interaction with hardware, and, only occasionally, small demos using those APIs. For many valid reasons, the development strategy is also very cautious and, from my perspective, the roadmap is not aggressive or innovative. Plus, the team is facing some very formidable external competition which may threaten the broad usefulness of what is being developed in the next few years.

My concern with accepting the offer is that it would not provide the learning experiences I would like as I start my career as the team does development specifically in the Android ecosystem (want to learn and explore other areas/platforms/large scale systems/data analytic systems) and has a cautious development strategy (want to innovate and work in a fast paced environment).

I think I can supplement the work experience with my own projects/contributions to open source but will this supplemental experience be sufficient when applying for jobs in other areas of interest down the road? Or, would looking for something new to gain some actual industry experience in other areas be better? Before accepting, can I inquire about the state of the project/long-term goals? I am worried that I would be pigeon-holing myself if I took the job offer."

My goal for the journey is to have a good career and make a solid salary.**

Currently I am doing a half year internship after finishing my junior year of college. I will graduate at the end of 2015. In this internship, I intended to code a lot, however, I noticed that we had a serious need for more organized infrastructure (code review, continuous integration, infrastructure configuration). I was given a lot of freedom and just started doing what I thought would be of the most value to the team, which was improving our infrastructure.

Through this process, I have become interested in devops tools (most everything you would see if you looked for tools listed in job descriptions with devops in the title). I am deliberating whether or not I should continue with this type of infrastructure work (there are plenty of cool things left to do), or if I should branch out into more coding once I finish my current project.

**Will infrastructure/sysadmin/devops work get my where I want to be, or should I focus on development?**

**Will I be stunting my career or hurting my salary if I do infrastructure/sysadmin/devops work instead of becoming a dev?**"

I'm pretty frustrated by my lack of progress, so I figured that it might help to ask you Redditors to see what I'm doing wrong.

To give you guys a a little bit of context: I recently got a BSME degree with a 3.33 GPA and in terms of experience, my senior project team landed a patent for an improved medical device (I designed it).  After that, I got an internship doing a lot of process engineering research for a winery for about 6 months.  All in all, I have about 1 year of actual engineering experience and several years of hospitality experience.

As the title also suggests, I have a pretty good base of general knowledge and and a strong intuition for everything from plumbing to computers and electronics, but I haven't really found anything in particular that I am particularly *good* at (my grades literally look like an inclined staircase).  

I will admit that I have been looking solely for ME jobs, but is the market really that tough to break in to?  

From what I've seen so far, 60-70% of entry level jobs require 3 years of experience, CADD work requires 5 years of AutoCAD or Solidworks (I only know Pro/E pretty well), and the remaining 30-40% of jobs get FLOODED by new grads from presumably more recognizable colleges.  "

[1]. What is working on a research team like?

-	I have worked in an agile corporate environment during an internship and the process here makes perfect sense to me.  We are all striving to create a product and therefore working on different aspects of it to speed up the process.  Do research teams work the same?

[2]. What’s the best way to approach a research center?

-	Should I have a proposed research topic ready and see if it’s something they are interested in taking on or should I first talk to them about their research interests and see if mine match?

[3]. Is it normal for a researcher to lecture if the research center is attached to a college? If so, what is that like coming from a researcher’s perspective?

[4]. Let’s say I finish my Phd, what would be the normal next step?

-	Do most researchers continue their work or do they move onto other projects/corporate environments?

Thanks for reading this far, if I need to clarify anything I’d be perfectly happy to do so.

This happend around 6 years ago. 

I was finishing an internship and I met a girl there who worked in the same department. She was cute, hungry for attention and I liked giving her the attention. She was also a total slut.
Every monday we would discuss her weekend in great detail, often talking about who she dated and/or cheated with. 
Note: She was really into black guys.

Around this time I invited a friend of mine into the company social network. This was totally not allowed, but I trusted him. 
A few days in a row we chatted using private conversations and then one time, Just one time, i made the mistake of not starting a private conversation. 
We ended up talking in the Company stream, for all eyes to see. 
Even saying stuff like ""Haha, imagine if people could see this!""... 

At some point he said 
""So, did you hook up with that girl yet?
-- Nah, I tried, but that's not going to work..
-- Besides, she's into black dicks anyway""

... Aaaand that's when shit hit the fan.

an hour later or so she walks into the office (it was just me in there), shouting ""I KNOW AND I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN"". 
I remember thinking ""I know?"" ""Know what?"". 
""OH. 
SHIT.""

I was tripping balls at that point, scared shitless what would happen. 

I sat there about 5 minutes, trying to figure out what to do. Then my manager came around the corner and asked me to step into his office. 
I sat down and he says ""Yeah.. so.. That wasn't smart"", with a smirk on his face. 
""I think it's best you go home for the rest of the day"". 
So i did.. 

When I got to work the next day I had a meeting with him. As my internship was about to end anyway, he said he couldn't offer me a job and that was to be 'my punishment'. He was pretty okay about it. 
I sent flowers to her with a letter attached explaining how sorry I was. As she wouldn't talk to me that was the best I could do. 

Since then i've been pretty careful on social networks and NEVER talk about colleagues through written text. I suggest you do the same :)"

I do mostly internal IT-support but also networking and basically all other things related to IT. I'm quite new and I'm still learning a lot but up until today it had been going very smoothly. 

Anyway to the point. This morning I get a call about a guest from HQ who had trouble accessing the network. I go down to the conference room to see what was wrong. Now I admit I was a bit stressed out with all these high-up bosses sitting in the room waiting for me to fix this before they could begin their meeting. This conference room has two routers on each side of a big round table with cables in every port hanging loose. The point of this is when there are a lot of visitors they can easily plug in their laptop without any hassle. However it was very messy today, some cables weren't even connected to the router and were just adding to the mess. 

I start troubleshooting and quickly come to the conclusion that the computer gets a bad IP-address. I try to plug in a different cable, I try some ipconfig commands and I try to plug it in from the other router. 

None of it seems to work. In this cable mess I start to reattach all the cables I've used and all the loose cables just laying there. I then processed to leave the room to check if the trouble is in the switch or server end. 

This is when all hell breaks loose. My phone starts ringing. People are having trouble with the network. 

&gt; It must be the server causing trouble.

I think to myself as I go up the stairs. I then run into the senior system admin. He has already realised there is something wrong whit the network. I see he's on the phone, he signals me to follow him down to the server room. After the call he turns to me. 

&gt; I think some of the network guys working downstairs have messed up a connection causing a loop, this has happened before.

I think for a few seconds.

&gt; Shit. 

I just realised what I might have done. I run up to the conference room and sure enough, one of the cables goes out from the router and then back in. I unplug it. The network slowly recovers. 

Even though I realised my mistake pretty fast, it still caused one of our production servers to go down and not wanting to come back on. The production was down for a few hours before we managed to fix it. 

EDIT: I knew some real system admins would come in and set things straight! I had no idea this could happen or that you can set it up to prevent it. I will talk to my colleague about it tomorrow (if I don't get fired). Thanks guys! 

**TL;DR I fucked up by plugging two sides of a cable to the same router, causing the whole network to go down and the production to stop for hours.**

She was apologetic, I told her it was not a big deal at all, while I took the sheets from the bed, I noticed strange lines in the bed frame, since the hospital did not have adequate funding, so I just thought it was fairly old. Upon closer inspection, the lines were not clean paint wear, the paint had been chipped off, as if someone had drug their fingernails down the rail. I took the sheets to the dirty linen depository, dropped them in, when I heard a thump. I looked in, to see the linens were not being removed from the basket, and the chute had clogged up. So I went to the basement to switch out the basket for an empty one.

Thats when I found the book.

It was leather-bound, fairly old. With the name S.Cavnee written very elegant handwriting. I took it up to my quarters after fitting Mary’s bed with fresh sheets and began reading. Its hard to sum up, so ill just give you the text.

January 1,1899   The governor’s legislation to erect a campus for the insane goes into effect this year, it will be finished by august of 1904. I think I will try and get a job there.

August 31, 1904  Its a very beautiful campus, I guess I was the first to apply, so I got a lead position, warden’s assistant, very optimistic.

September 2,1904   The first round of Patients have come today, 45 of them, overflow from Custer, they told me. I got them all tagged.

September 15, 1904  Tension is high. They are bringing in more nurses.

September 30, 1904  five people are dead. Two nurses and three patients. The culprit was an out of towner, he’s already in Springfield.

		Springfield was a Prison in South Dakota at that time

October 5, 1904   This is a state ward. Why are there nuns here? I feel like I should talk to one of the higher ups in Pierre. I have the next two days off, I think I might catch the next train up there.

October 6,1904   I’m in Pierre, talked to the surgeon general’s office, they told me not to worry about it, and to just go back to work like a good christian woman.


October 10, 1904   10 new patients arrived. One stood out to me. She had very dark black hair, darkest I have ever seen. Her hands were wrapped in bandages, I assumed she cut herself. When she stepped off the bus, she made eye contact with me, all they way from the window of  the second floor. 

October 15, 1904  Kathy told me about the black haired girl, she said her name was Rose,  Kathy told me under her bandages were the longest, thickest fingernails she had seen in her entire life. I have to see it for myself. I’m going to look in her window tonight. Sneak a Peek.

October 16, 1904 3:20am   I’m very freaked out right now. I looked into her window. She was standing in the middle of her bed frame, her mattress was on the floor next to her. She was just looking out the window, then she turned and looked at me. I unlocked the door, turned the light on, and she dropped something.  Then she came at me with the speed of a train, knocking me to the ground, I turned my head just in time to see her turn the corner. I got up and ran after her, but I could not find her. I went back and made her bed, turned the light off, and locked her door, I ran back to my room. No one knows I let her out. She is somewhere in the hospital. Somewhere."

I currently have a 3.94 GPA at a mid-tier school in GA. I've had a few research experiences at my university and a couple of summer internships in CA. I received a job offer for when I graduate with the company in CA for $80k, and I am having my first technical phone interview with Google next week (wish me luck!), hoping for another offer. Until recently, I was resolved to get my Ph.D. next, but then I realized that I don't need a Ph.D. for what I want to do, and making money sounds a lot better than another 4-6 years of school.



My ideal scenario when I graduate is to get a nice job and eventually go back to school part-time for a Master's (since most companies will foot the bill for that). 



I love the company I did my internships with, but I don't like the Los Angeles area, and I don't think I'd want to settle down there permanently. Hence I don't know how much I should be considering their job offer, given that if I did accept it, it would almost certainly be temporary since I don't think I'd ever feel at home in LA. I am thinking that I should start applying to other companies and see what pans out, hopefully somewhere that I would enjoy living more. 



Here's the problem though: I am planning things with my fiancé who will be attending graduate school next year for sure (where, we won't know until ~March). I won't take a job in a city where he doesn't have admittance to a good school, but again, we won't hear back from grad schools until around March (applying to schools in Boulder, CO; Atlanta, GA; College Park, MD; Austin, TX; Charlottesville, VA; Champaign, IL; and Columbus, OH). So what should I be doing in the meantime? Should I apply for jobs in random candidate cities in the meantime, knowing that only one city is where we will choose? Should I wait until March and see what pans out for graduate school and then apply for jobs? Should I be applying to graduate school as well, since I ultimately do want at least my Master's?"
2dxxkn,5,2014-08-18,"For the first time in my life, I can honestly say I'm f***ed.",whatismyliiferightno,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2dxxkn/for_the_first_time_in_my_life_i_can_honestly_say/,"For the first time in my life, I'm telling myself, ""I'm so fucked."" I'm so fucked...I feel like I've worked so hard to get out of my situation but it has all been a waste because I'm at a point that's 2x lower than where I was when I thought I hit rock bottom a few weeks ago.

Let me start with a quick background. I do software dev. I'm a recent grad (22) with a major in CS. I started programming at 11 and taught myself how to create web and mobile apps. I also have years of graphic design experience. A lot of the freelancing  I did in college involved logo design, brand development, and print design.

After school, I couldn't find an affordable apartment (the cheapest one I found that wasn't in the boonies was 1.5K/mo (not including utilities) with a month's worth of rent as a deposit) so I ended up subletting at a friends' townhouse. Right around this time, I became unemployed because the company I worked for wasn't doing so well, basically. For two months, I went through all my savings, and toward the end of the 2nd month, I got so desperate while applying for a ton of jobs, getting 4 hours of sleep a night thanks to Vyvanse.

I finally landed a job but, two weeks later, I lost it because I ""wasn't the right fit for the job"" which I still question because my performance always met, if not exceeded, expectations.

I was back on the job hunt again. After a few days, I realized that I had almost no money to sustain my life so I went into ""desperation mode"" again.

I spent nearly all waking moments searching for jobs. I went thrifting and bought the best interview clothes I could find. I researched companies in depth before interviews. I created multiple versions of my resume so it catered to the job I applied for.  I made two designs for my resume: one for companies with a ""startup"" culture and a plain one for companies with a corporate culture / gov't contractors. I even invested money in a bunch of body products so I would look presentable for every interview.

I mean this in the most humble way possible: my resume is very impressive for a 22 yo. I started freelancing in high school, working in small web dev teams. In addition to my software engineering intern positions, actual software developer job my senior year, and my contract work at a US government agency (I have a clearance), I have 6 years of relevant experience. Despite the impressive resume, my job search continues and I'm already 3 weeks into it. 

Some people have told me I'm just complaining and I'm not working hard enough. That's not the case. I have done so many initial interviews that I lost track (I applied literally everywhere I could) and at least 1/4th of them were technical interviews/tests (which, except for 1, I did better than they expected). I have been working with 5 different recruiters to find a job. I've scoured Craigslist, Monster, Dice, etc. I have friends with parents who are execs at big tech companies (Microsoft, HP, VMWARE, etc) but the jobs available 1. Are not in the area or 2. Have high requirements I don't meet. I go to every local tech meetup I can to network. I even utilized social media; I used Buffer to post something related to my field on my social networks every few hours and tweeted at local tech companies. I actually got an interview doing this.

I used to be confident at every interview but I now have to fake it because every interview that didn't result in a job picked away at my confidence. I used to feel so proud of the work I did but now, I'm starting to think that sacrificing my social life in HS for something I loved wasn't worth it. 


At this point, I feel like I have exhausted all of my resources. I've done *literally* EVERYTHING I could think of to survive while job searching. Freelancing doesn't pay all of the bills. My rent payment is way overdue. I have less than $100 in my bank account and I recently got food stamps so I wouldn't starve. I'm incredibly depressed, even though I'm taking Prozac. I'm happy I still have insurance because there is NO way I can pay for Vyvanse and Prozac every month.

Are there any other options? Is there anything else I can do? Living in a metro area with more tech jobs than people that can fill them, you'd think that it'd be easy to find a job. Am I doing anything wrong? Should I approach job hunting a different way? I'm open to suggestions because nothing is working for me. I'm at a dead end and I can't find a way out.

TLDR; despite my work experience and job search efforts, it is unusually difficult for me to find a job. Having no income for so long, I am struggling to survive and I don't know where to go from here"

 My cumulative GPA is going to suck (2.3) because I was just awful/didn't care/terrible person my freshman and sophomore year. My junior year I took several AP classes and a very hard schedule and easily got a 3.5 for the year unweighted. Still, my GPA is going to be at 2.3 by the time I send off applications. I got 4's on APUSH and English Language, I also had 3 duel credit classes through a local college (separate from the one mentioned below) just from my regular classes. This year I am taking AP GOV and AP COMP SCI and plan on getting a 4 and 5 respectively. I am also currently enrolled in a local college in a cool program they have where I can take classes at my high school for half a day then go take classes at the college. This is a somewhat decent college however it is certainly a place I do not want my diploma from. I will have 13 credit hours by Christmas and plan on taking another 9 or 10 in the spring. My college gpa is a 4.0 but I've only finished one class during the summer. 

As far as standardized tests goes, 24 on ACT and 1700 SAT however I can easily bring my act up to a 28-29 and plan on doing so. 

Outside of school I am currently in an ongoing 2 year internship with the technology department at my high school, however I plan on working at the college I am currently attending's technology department because they will be able to pay during the school year unlike my high school. I also have a IT certification from Comptia and I play golf and manage track and field for sports. I am also in a leadership role with student council this year. I also have extremely good letters of recommendation from extraordinary friends and I am extremely confident in my essay writing abilities. 

Also not sure if this would be something I should mention is that I will be volunteering with the FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada next summer (2015) with their technology/broadcasting crew. 

I know this is a lot but I'm extremely concerned about my GPA being such an ugly blemish that would get my application turned away automatically. "

**Sorry for the late edit. I decided to take the job with the pay at $10/hr. I didn't negotiate partly due to nervousness and because of low pressure from my parents, who were happy for me anyway, and partly because I wasn't willing to walk away from the offer in the first place. I definitely learned my lesson about procrastinating during the internship app season, and I'll definitely start months earlier next year. If I'd had started earlier, I probably would have had more options to choose from. The lack of options made it easy for me to just take this offer. I do think I am underpaid however, as my work has been praised and generally well-received, and I can tell that my input is valued. This experience has definitely given me a confidence boost with regard to the way I perceive my competency.**

---original post below--

I just got my **first internship** 2 weeks ago doing web app development at a start-up. It is mainly back-end work with PHP and MySQL in addition to some front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far it has been a good experience as I am being taught and mentored by a senior developer, with the only drawback being that it is unpaid.

I did some research last week and found out that the internship is actually illegal, according to many sources including: http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/04/19/6-legal-requirements-for-unpaid-internship-programs/. The company also found out that it is illegal, and today they offered to hire me on as a junior developer at $10/hr.

My question is: **should I argue for higher pay, or accept?** I will be doing the same work as I am doing already, and they might be thinking that since I have already agreed to work for free that I will accept an offer without any hesitance.  I am a fourth year student in a CS program at a well-known west coast university. However, I have no practical experience outside of classes, and my GPA is ~~slightly less than 3.0~~ a 2.9.

I am meeting with the CEO tomorrow to discuss the terms of my employment. I have already talked to a few friends and family members about my situation, but I'd like a second opinion. Thanks in advance!

Edit: a word, formatting

Edit 2: I have relatively little experience with programming. I entered school as a bioengineering major, took my first programming class at the end of sophomore year (spring 2013), and switched to CS just last fall (2013, start of junior year). I learned all of those languages I mentioned earlier specifically for this job, and had only C/C++ experience prior.

Located in West LA. There is only 1 other dev out of about 8 employees.

Edit 3: Leaning towards asking for higher pay, as everyone has suggested so far.

Edit 4: I also know that two other interns were hired around the same time as me, but both of them quit before their first week was over."
2dytnq,3,2014-08-19,Working as the go-to technical guy in the department,devbro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2dytnq/working_as_the_goto_technical_guy_in_the/,"I graduated last spring with a BS in Business Administration/Management Information Systems. The summer before my final year, I was able to get an internship in the IT Project Management Office for a large healthcare company. 

When I first started, I thought my work would be more administrative / ""analyst"" type work with Excel like a Project Coordinator. However, my manager apparently saw potential in my skills/technical background and kind of slowly steered me towards doing more technical work. My current role focuses on light business application development / process improvement. 

My earliest work consisted of simple ""tools"" created in Excel with some formulas / light VBA. I also did work developing our department's SharePoint site with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I've also developed / implemented other simple front-end SharePoint solutions. The SharePoint department restricts user permissions so I haven't really had the chance to do any back end-development. I haven't really had any programming mentors / more experienced developers to guide me so I wouldn't even know where to start, although, the company has has resources available for me like an MSDN subscription and servers for dev environments. I just haven't really looked into these options much.

I'm currently working on a relational database management system that will organize and track a multi-million dollar budget for project resources associated with all the projects in the project portfolio. I am creating it with MS Access 2010 because I think its going to be a relatively simple to intermediate system. I also don't really have experience with other programming languages and database development. Most of my experience has been with front-end web development stuff.

After my internship ended, I was offered a temp position as a project coordinator because they didn't have any regular full-time employee openings. I had the opportunity to possibly transfer to a different department as a Programmer Analyst working on a development team developing enterprise-wide applications. This would have been a full-time regular employee position with likely higher pay. I chose to stick with the temp position and didn't even try to interview for the Programmer Analyst job. I chose the temp position because I felt comfortable with where I was. I report to a Director who knows everyone and regularly reports to executives and I felt like it could possibly be more beneficial long-term for my career. I also felt a sense of loyalty to my manager for giving me my first break and I know I can do a lot more to help him and his department advance. I also like his management style / flexibility and I felt uncertain about the change in dynamics from reporting to a front-line manager and/or tech lead. My manager also said it will eventually become a regular full-time position when they get more openings.

As a ""Project Coordinator"" I'm getting paid $23/hr or ~$46,500 a year (40hrs/week) in the Los Angeles / Orange County area. However, I don't really feel like I'm just a Project Coordinator. I do the project management stuff on top of development for my projects. On one hand,I feel very fortunate for the opportunity I have and a part of me is saying I should keep my mouth shut but I feel undervalued relative to my co-workers/team members. Two of my co-workers were interns who started around the same time as me and they were also hired as Project Coordinators. However, their skillsets are limited to typical project coordinating/administrative/ data entry/ simple Excel stuff.  Another team member that was just hired gets paid $30/hr because she had years of experience even though she just re-entered the job force after 4 years off. She and one of the other former interns do ~95% data entry / email correspondence. The database application I'm creating is actually meant to make their jobs way easier because right now they're keeping everything in an Excel workbook that's like 100MB which is full of so many inaccuracies, they can't even create reports or provide accurate data without taking a week.

Two other senior members of the team are also limited to administrative / data entry type work. I think they have 20+ years experience each so their titles are IT Manager and Technical Project Manager and both titles make at least $100k a year at this company. 

As the resource with the most technical skills, my role has focused on researching and developing solutions to help make everyone else's jobs easier. Sometimes I end up being a firefighter and doing their work for them.

I want to talk to my manager about getting paid more but I'm not sure how to go about it. Can I make the argument that my technical skills are worth more than the relatively simple skills for Project Coordinators. I feel more like a Systems Analyst than a Project Coordinator.

Also, I like the work and have learned a lot but most of that learning has been through countless hours of trial and error and solving problems by myself. I've learned pretty much almost nothing from anyone else as far as technical/programming skills. Am I pigeonholing myself by staying where I am and being a sort of jack-of-all trades type?

Long story short: I started an internship recently. My boss has instructed that I learn and use VIM or VI for my work there. 

I understand why- proficient use of VIM basically eliminates the need for anything other than your keyboard.

I've been using sublime text 3 (which I've purchased) and absolutely love it. I've spent some time customizing plug ins and really like how it's configured.

VIM, on the other hand, seems like a huge pain in the ass. Scratch that, IT IS a huge pain in the ass. Vanilla VIM, without customization, is useless. Command mode is a cool concept but...

**why the fuck can't I use backspace like any other normal editor?**

I have sausage fingers and often make one-letter typos while writing code. I want to be able to fix those instead of having to esc, delete, esc to fix small errors. 

Anyways, I downloaded [Cream](http://cream.sourceforge.net/), which is vastly easier than raw VI, but it still lacking some of the stuff I love about sublime (like the scrollable document overview, and even highlighting matching braces for fucks sake). Plus, Cream's implementation of some things is just vastly inferior (like highlighting and changing the color of parts of code... sometimes they just get it wrong).

I downloaded GVIM, which at least gives you the ability to click on your document and use arrow keys. But still...

Now that I'm on a full rant, I'm frustrated that people feel that they should be able to dictate someone's preference in text editors. This whole VIM fiasco has taken me from a productive, happy programmer to someone who starts the work day pissed off because I'm lacking basic functionality like being able to fucking backspace. It seems counterproductive. 

**TL:DR; I have to use VIM/VI for work, and I need someone to convince me it isn't terrible. Also, backspace.**"

I'm not actually a CS major, I'm an Information Assurance major (which can be an area of concentration for CS majors at my school) a lot of the basic framework for the degree is similar; we follow a core set of classes for all programs within the college of information science &amp; technology..

I was recently inducted into a program specifically for Information Assurance majors, it covers all the tuition for up to two years, pays a salary to go to school, has internship requirements and places me in a job for up to 2 years to repay their investment into my education. 

This is all fine and dandy, but, I took two courses over the summer to kickstart my program (Calc 1 and Advanced Java programming) and they both kicked my ass. Granted, Calculus was an online course and the Java course was condensed from 16 weeks to 6. Anyways, I lost all my financial aid and have to pay for the next two semesters out of pocket until I officially sign onto the scholarship program (you must graduate within two years of signing on, so, I delayed my entry)

My fear is that if I'm struggling with Calc and Programming then I will struggle even more with the more advanced classes. I wouldn't say that I dislike programming, I just have a hard time finding the fun in the assignments. They frustrate me to no end.


Thanks for reading, just looking for any general advice/suggestions, can clarify anything if needed."
2dzlh7,3,2014-08-19,Question About My Experiences For a Future Internship,bkzhotsauc3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2dzlh7/question_about_my_experiences_for_a_future/,"I was lucky enough to score an internship last minute in May for this summer at a defense company. The company isn't one of those top 10 defense companies like Boeing or Lockheed but they do work with them often and the company is actually going through reconstruction if you will. I got to know several engineers, most of them I'm sure have good things to say about me and one of them who I can consider a mentor and can definitely vouch for me in the future if I need to provide references.

The problem is that I want my next internship first of all to be at a commercial industry and also at my next internship, I dont want to work on anything that I have been doing on the internship I am at currently. The division I am interning for focuses solely on radar equipment and antennas. I have been assisting in setting up lab chambers so data could be analyzed. I also ran test verifications on radio signal delay devices that are a part of a bigger defense radar system that is installed on fighter planes and jets. And I also was able to create a matlab script that analyzed lab results that produced plenty of graphs and statistics that were actually used to present to the customer every week.

I major in computer engineering and quite frankly although this stuff is interesting, I can't picture myself going through another internship working with more antennas and radio frequency stuff. Working with the actual hardware was pretty neat but I guess radars and antennas arent for me and I want something more microchip related and computer hardware ish.

My question I guess is how much will my internship experience help me in terms of being a competitive candidate say for a position at microsoft, intel, ibm, samsung etc (something computer ish and techy). knowing that I do NOT want to work on anything that I had just worked on in my internship. I don't do much on campus besides alot of basketball because thats where I focus all of my free time but I do plan on joining some social clubs this semester. I have roughly a 3.3 overall gpa though my major gpa is about a 3.6 and I managed to get Dean's List last semester. Im headed into my junior year.

Im just troubled as to how an employer/HR will view me once I put my internship experiences on my resume. I know it helps alot that I already have an internship under my belt for a rising junior but I don't know I guess Im anxious to get a really good internship.

Thanks for your time in reading this."

I am currently doing Masters in CS in a public university in NY. I am an international student. I came to do masters after having worked for 2 years at an IT company as a developer. I am good at developing websites in java and lamp stack. But I am not good at algorithms or DS and I never had the need to learn them expect when I was doing my UG. Neither in my 2 years of work nor in my part time, I ever had to really think of an algorithm to do a task. My gpa is 3.0 in Masters. I have couple of projects on GitHub, not very good ones, but I felt it was good compared to my peers.

I did not get an internship despite getting few calls. I applied to many many companies. My friends who are not good coders got calls and they did not even have a coding interview. Some because of GPA, some because of luck [No offence, even they admit it].

Now, I got a call from ""Google"" and Amazon for a full time position. I really don't know how they evaluate profiles. I can say for sure I wont go past round 1. I am really disappointed. I am not getting calls from companies which I think I will clear, but from ""dream"" companies like this which I think I wont clear [Not pessimistic, but my evaluation based on my current skills].

My questions:

1. Should I feel better for getting call from dream company or its just an HR randomly picking a profile.
2. Are there some companies in which instead of tough algorithmic coding interview, they consider past projects and experience [little bit of algorithmic coding I can do]. If so please name them!

2e0suu,2,2014-08-19,What I've Learned While Building TechShare: Pointers on Product Development,Willfire19,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2e0suu/what_ive_learned_while_building_techshare/,"Over the past summer as an intern at CoshX Labs, I started a new project called TechShare, a marketplace for people to borrow and lend technical devices and gadgets. I have written a lengthy blog post [here](http://www.coshx.com/blog/2014/08/19/pointers-on-product-development), but if that's [a little long](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/793/785/849.gif) I have the points here.

**1: Identify Pain Points / Opportunities**

I've had plenty of ideas, but I'm using the majority of my time working on TechShare because I've seen many people stop working or hacking simply because they do not have the money or means to get the tools or equipment they need. There are services to share car rides and to share musical instruments, but there isn't a predominate device sharing service in the market right now. 

**2: Build Iteratively**

While it's definitely sexy to spend years on developing a product and launching it with a huge boom with people absolutely going bonkers over your perfect product, it's also very unlikely that will happen, and also very risky. I prefer the Minecraft model, in which you release the mvp as soon as possible, and build on that foundation depending on feedback from your early users.

**3: Marketing**

I greatly underestimated how much time and effort it would take to create buzz around TechShare. I've been told that it takes a person to hear about a product at least 7 times before they start thinking it's legit. You've got to be persistent and loud about your product if you want it to be heard.

**4: Sell / Give**

Sometimes, you have to go above and beyond the norm in order to sell an idea to people. In my blog post, I give a case study on how I got a few users through listening and giving.

I hope these pointers help you all out!

I loved working in biology and am also interested in biochemistry and molecular bio, though I lack formal schooling in those areas outside the internship. Most of my other expirience has been web dev(3 other internships). As a programmer, what options are there for someone interested in working in healthcare/biotechnology? What skills are required? I'm more interested in biotechnology than developing enterprise software for hospitals, though I would be happy to give enterprise a shot. 

I might go back to grad school to study bioinformatics in the future, but for now I'm going to spend some time in the workforce before considering school again. "

[PART 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2e8akj/the_woman_at_the_end_of_the_bar_part_3/)

Note: This story took place approximately 5 years ago. 



I cheated on my wife. I’m not proud of it, I’m not going to sit here and attempt to come up with some vainglorious excuses such as “our marriage is sexless” (it is), or “the children give us so much stress that we never have time for ourselves” (they do),  or my personal favourite, “money has put a real strain on our relationship,” (it hasn’t). There’s no other reason that I can come up with for what I did aside from the fact that I let my dick do the thinking. Now, well now I have to live with what I did. And it’s fucking terrible. 

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton. I am a practicing psychiatrist specializing in pediatrics, practicing here in Toronto. I am 48 years old, very fit (gym at least 5 times a week) and about 6’3. I have a nice body, but a so-so face. It gets the job done. I have practiced for almost 20 years and during this time I have seen my fair share of distressed and disturbed patients, but nothing prepared me for what I had to go through with Celeste. 

Celeste. She’s beautiful. She’s in her late 20s or early 30s, the time we spent together wasn’t really expended on hammering out finer details about one another’s personal lives so much as it was spent hammering out the details of who could undress the fastest. She’s got the perfect body with those hips that you can just grab onto where your thumb fits right into the groove and your bodies just lock in together. Perfect. Perfect hair, perfect smile, perfect everything. I am a mature and intellectual man, but what she presented to me that night made the 17 year old horn dog inside of me take over. Wife and marriage be damned.

My wife Daphne is a principal at a public school here in the city. She works very hard and I admire her for that, but to put it in the most blunt fashion possible. Our marriage is virtually over. Neither of us have had the balls (ovaries?) to tell the other that we should leave, and I think that on some deep connected level bound together by children and time, we’ve grown to expect one another in each other’s lives, but for all intents and purposes, we should not be married. We should be good friends, but marriage should not be the foundation of our relationship. Strange for me to say that, you’d think that being a psychiatrist that I’d be all in touch with my feelings, and no willing to let anything get in the way of my mental health, but I’ll let you in on a little secret: teachers raise the worst children, dentists have the worst oral hygiene, and psychiatrists have no fucking clue how to conduct themselves in a mentally healthy fashion. 

My wife started to neglect our children shortly after her promotion, when our youngest was 14. She became obsessed with climbing the ladder, possibly making superintendent one day. She had the cuts for it, but now she’s a husk of her former self: overworked by the system and discarded like so many other potential hopefuls. Where once there burned a fire, there’s no just the dying embers of a passion for children, a passion for teaching, a passion for pretty much all the things that I fell in love with her for. 

Mind you, I’m no prize myself. See, the thing they don’t tell you in medical school is that regardless of how successful or amazing you may be, there’s really no career advancement. Sure you go from internship to residency, but then you just sort of coast at that level until someone ahead of you dies or retires. The money is fantastic, but the drive to continue to go forward, quite like my wife, does end up diminishing after a while. You find yourself looking for new and more beautiful outlets that allow you to feel like you’re reaping a reward for giving yourself up for the betterment of others. 

And that’s where Celeste came into the picture. 

It was a regular night like any other. I had finished my rounds and was about to head home. I had taken to riding the subway since getting out of downtown in the summer is an awful nightmare. There’s no room for movement and the traffic is utter garbage. I changed out of my scrubs into my regular clothing and left the change room. On my way out I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and I looked good. I had just worked a full 12 hour shift, but my hair was just messy enough to pass off as trendy, and my clothing was just wrinkled enough to not make me look like a frumpy old man. I always liked the way my pecs looked in the shirt that I was wearing. 

I let the hospital saying goodnight to the usual crew and made my way onto the street. It was still relatively bright out and that fresh summer smell that somehow rose about the stench of open swears and the deep fried grease of the Chinese restaurant next door, hung in the air. I had had a relatively rough week (two suicides), and I wanted to just take my time getting home. The idea of opening the door to three angry children and a wife who looked like she walked through a hail storm every day wasn't very appealing. 

I walked down University avenue and made my way into Yorkville, a relatively trendy spot in the city with lots of bars, lots of money, and lots of money. As I turned the corner onto Cumberland Street I could see the patios and pergolas of the more refined eateries were filling up and didn’t really want to be part of that scene tonight. I walked down the road a bit more and could see that there was still room at The Attic, one of the newer bars with fancy guest lists and what my daughter advises me is called mandatory “bottle service,” (Table service, in my day).

I walked up to the entrance and went inside. I had been here once before with a group of the younger interns who had invited us older folks out to celebrate their gradual progressions, but was quite drunk that night, so I didn’t remember quite how beautiful it was. Everything was a clean, sterile mixture of black and grey and the staff were impeccably dressed. Women in above the knee dresses and men in shirt and tie. I worked hard, and it was nice to see from time to time what I was able to afford. I came from nothing, and it’s nice to sort of feel like you’re “at the top” every once in a while. 

I sat at the bar where the bartender continued to feed me cocktail after cocktail, vodka-water-barlime, was my usual choice but that night I found myself trying everything from 18 year old Whiskey to blends of scotch that I didn’t even know existed. Some of my tastes are refined, but the vast majority of the time I tend to relapse to my university days when it comes to drinking. 

I sat at the bar for about two hours and had built up quite the buzz. The drinks kept coming and the bill kept building. I didn’t care, I just wanted to enjoy the dying days of summer in a place where no one knew me, and no one expected anything from me. 

“I’ll take the bill,” I finally said, the urge to eat something overpowering me. 

“Certainly Sir, I’ll bring it to you right away,” the kind bartender said. He disappeared around the corner of the bar and came back with the receipt about 2 minutes later. I looked down at it and figured it had to be a mistake. 

It said that my total was zero. 0.00. No dollars owed. 

I flagged down the bartender who turned towards me and approached with a smile, “I’m sorry, but I think there’s an error with the bill,” I said, my speech more slurred than I expected. “It says that I owe nothing,” I had drank at least 150.00 worth of high end scotch alone, let alone the other drinks. 

“The bill was paid for by that woman,” the bartender said, again with the coy smile, as he pointed to the most beautiful woman I had laid eyes on in a very long time. At the end of the bar sat Celeste. As mentioned before, perfect hair, perfect body, perfect fucking everything. 

I honestly didn’t know what to think. Was she a former patient? I had run into former patients before who had brought me gifts or paid for meals, but this woman didn’t look familiar at all. She looked too old to have been one of my patients, and she had an allure to her that 20 years of marriage couldn’t overcome. I got up and my knee trembled a little, in hindsight I’m certain it was the booze, but in that moment the woman at the end of the bar seemed to be the case of the tremor.

As I made my way over to her I could notice that she had a smile on her face and had locked eyes with me. I approached and very nervously said, “Hello, My name is Dr. Jeremy Stanton, and I presume you’re the lovely person whose paid my bill?” I had a somewhat paternal smile on and felt like a bit of a creep, I had never hit on a woman that was this young. What am I saying, I had never really hit on a woman since I got married! 

“Doctor Stanton eh?” she said, “Well my name is Celeste, and I guess my investment paid off more than I thought it would,” she winked at me. 

“Pleasure to meet you Celeste,” I slurred back at her, “What do you mean by investment?” I was genuinly impressed that such a beautiful, young woman was also so very well spoken and quick. 

“200.00 dollars and I got a doctor’s attention, not a bad turn around.” She was very blunt, and at this point had turned her face towards her drink. Her profile was beautiful, almost like it was carved out of marble. Creamy and stern at the same time. 

“You could have gotten my attention by just looking over,” THAT was the best that I could do? Man I certainly was rusty when it came to hitting on women, but at least I knew what her intentions were. A swirl of decisions flew through my mind. What the hell was I doing? Was my wife expecting me at home? Did I have to take one of the kids somewhere? Was there someway I could do this and get away with it? When was the last time I had had sex? I didn’t even have a condom on me. What the hell?! Was I actually going to cheat on my wife? Did this woman even want sex? 

“Oh I know I could have, this way, it’s just more fun. People tend to make better decisions when they’ve had a few drinks.” She replied, again, I was just staring at that profile, she never made eye contact with me while saying all of this.

“Better decisions?” I chuckled, “I think that’s debatable!” Knowing exactly what I wanted out of this situation. I had been hit on before, but I had never been hit on by a woman that looked like this before. Especially one so young.

“The decisions that I want you to make are the better decisions,” She turned towards me and had the most come hither look I had ever seen in my life. Her smile screamed fuck me, and her eyes, god those fucking eyes. 

“I, uh, well, I, will you excuse me for a second.” I panicked and excused myself to the bathroom. As soon I got into the single bathroom I locked the door, stood in front of the mirror and stared at myself. Was I going to do this? The four seasons was across the road and I knew the general manager, his son had been a patient of mine, so I knew that discretion was guaranteed. I splashed some water on my face, took one of the soft towels from the basked near the sink and dried myself off. I stared at myself in the mirror, my chest was heaving, my heart was racing, and my dick was already half hard. 

And then I took off my wedding ring.

I had made the decisions. C’mon Jer, you don’t live anymore, do this for yourself, you do everything for the damn kids and your wife who doesn’t even touch you. Just go out there, and fuck that woman’s brains out. 

I entered the bar area with a new sense of bravado. I walked right back up to Celeste and put my arm on her shoulder. “Hey, how about we get out of here, it’s getting late.” She smiled and got up from her seat. Her sexy legs were made even more beautiful by the high heels she gracefully wore. 
We left the restaurant and both her and I smoked a couple cigarettes before we made our way across the road to the Four Seasons. I had texted my buddy from the bathroom and there was a room waiting for us by the time we made our way inside. 

“Hello Dr. Stanton, thank you for choosing the Four Seasons, enjoy your night.” The staff here were amazing, and their discretion was always profound. Celeste and I made our way to the elevator and she pressed the button. As we waited, I took out my phone and texted my wife. 

“Hey Hun, I’ll be at the hospital overnight, they want me on-call” 

“k” was the only response I received. 20 years of marriage, I was about to fuck a random woman who I had just met, and that one letter response just drove home the loveless marriage that I had waiting for me. I knew I was making the decision that I wanted to make. 

We entered the room, and found the intimacy kit. It contained three condoms, some lube, and other personal items that make nights like this not so regrettable; at least children weren’t going to be a byproduct of this decision. 

Within 5 minutes we were both naked and Celeste was on her knees doing what she did so well. I returned the favour, being particularly proud of my ability to please a woman (sure, it had been my wife for the past two decades, but I hadn’t forgotten the ropes). We fucked for hours, only stopping to reload on more booze and to smoke the occasional cigarette. We fucked on the floor, on the bed, and at one point on the desk. It was amazing. All of the endless hours that I had spent at the gym had kept me in fighting form, and she loved it. She was the best that I had ever had. 

By the time we took our last break, the sun was rising, and we were both a combination of drunk and exhausted. She finished her cigarette and crushed out the butt in the ash tray next to her bed.

“I have to go, I have an early client meeting. I had a really great night” She said to me as she was gettin dressed. “Do you think you can get my zipper for me,” she turned her back towards me and held her long black hair out of the way. I got out of the bed and did up the zipper. I kissed her neck and then her back, all while sliding my hand up the front of her leg, under her dress. 

She turned and kissed me, “Thanks Dr. Stanton,” again she winked, and again my knee gave out a little, “I had a really great night,” she concluded as she put on her shoes and made her way out of the door. 

I went back to the bed, my shift didn’t start until 1pm, and it was about 8am at this point. As my head hit the pillow, I realized then and there want a colossal twat I was. 

I didn’t get her fucking number. I had no way of contacting this woman. All I knew was that her name was Celeste. I mean, she knew mine, but goddammit I hope she wouldn’t attempt to contact me at work. As I lay there, beating myself up, I managed to fall back asleep. It was the best sleep that I had had in years. 

About three hours later, close to noon, my phone began to ring. It was my wife calling. 

Me: Hello honey, how are you? 

Daphne: Today’s been a rough day Jeremy, but I think it’ll be fine. How was your overnight shift? 

Me: Um, oh yeah, it was good, spent most of the time sleeping, luckily they didn’t need me. 

Daphne: Oh, well that’s good, ok just wanted to check in, I’ll see you for dinner tonight with Ambrose and his wife. 

Ambrose was my wife’s godawful cousin. My wife had come from money and Ambrose hated the fact that she married me, most likely because my single mother was on social assistance. Ambrose's wife was no treat either, sort of like a cross between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen. God she had an awfully long neck (the wife, not Sigourney)

Me: ok Honey, you have a good one. 

I hung up the phone and took a long, much needed shower. As I stood there, water washing away the physical marks of the night before, the emotional toll of my decision started to set in. I had cheated on the woman who had given me children with a woman whose full name I didn’t even know. God I really was a dick head. The good thing is that the chances of my wife finding out were minimal. 

I finished up at the hotel, made my way back to the hospital and worked my shift. I left around 5pm and took the train home. I walked the rest of the way from the station to my house, and just stood in front of my home before I went inside. I had always considered myself an emotionally strong man, but the choices I had made were weighing on me, and I began to feel bad for not telling my wife. I lit up one more cigarette before making my way inside and just sat on the front steps not knowing how to reconcile my actions with my beliefs. I had fucked another woman. Shit. 

I finally worked up the courage to enter the house and there were my kids, my wife, Ambrose and his alien wife. All sitting there, as if waiting for me, waiting to judge me for something that they didn’t know I had done. 

“Hello Everyone! I hope you’ve all had a wonderful day,” I exclaimed in my best dad voice, not wanting to raise suspicion. 

“We’ve been waiting for dinner, but everything else has been ok,” Ambrose retorted in his smug voice. God I hated that guy. 

“Well, I’m hear now, so let’s eat!” I smiled back. Don’t start anything, don’t bring attention to yourself. 

Everyone sat down to dinner and I went into the kitchen to see if I could offer my wife any help. Always the happy couple. Party-face. 

“Did you have a good day at work,” she asked without raising her eyes to meet mine. 

“Yes, did yours improve,” I asked as I made my way behind her to give her a hug. She was chopping carrots, and something just felt tense. Something was awry, did she know? How?

“Where’s your wedding ring Jeremy,” she put down the knife and turned around to face me. She was concerned, I could see it in her face.

“Oh, I took it off while I was at work, I had to do two physical workups today,” God what a terrible lie, I’m a psychiatrist, I usually don’t physically interact with patients. 

“You’ve never had to do that before, you’ve never taken it off,” she retorted, her voice slightly more raised.

“Honey, relax, I took it off for work,” I fished the ring out of my pocket and placed it back on my hand. “There, are you happy now Daphne!” I barked back at her. This wasn’t the time for this conversation, I didn’t want Ambrose to know anything about me or my family. I reminded Daphne of this, and she agreed. We took the food out and all sat down. 

“A Toast, to doctor and principal Stanton, thank you for ha” Ambrose’s toast was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. I excused myself and made my way to the front door. As I opened it, I realized that there was no one there. Emptiness. I was about to shut the door and head back inside, thinking it was a neighbourhood kid playing a prank, until I looked down. 

There, on the stoop, was a box. I bent down and picked it up, turned, and closed the door behind me. As I inspected the box I realized that it had small tag on it. I turned it over and all it said was “for Jeremy, as a thank you” 

“Honey, who is it?” my wife called from the dining room. 

“No one, just some kids playing a prank I guess” I responded and made my way into the bathroom on the first floor with the box. 

I set the box down on the counter and slowly opened the top, not knowing what to expect. Inside there was an envelope. 

*Thanks for a beautiful night Jeremy, hopefully you get some rest tonight. I’ll be in touch*

*-Celeste*

I nearly yelled, how the hell did she know where I lived?! What the hell was going on? I fucked up, and I fucked up badly, now this woman was sure to be the end of me. Fuck the divorce and the kids and the angry wife and the alimony. Fuck Fuck Fuck. 

I opened the envelope and suddenly realized I was in more trouble than I suspected. Inside were a series of four pictures.

- Me leaving the hotel 

- Me entering the hospital 

- Me smoking outside 

- Me on the train home. 

What the fuck had I done.

However, an internship earned through a professor netted me a very cushy IT position (90k per year) with the very large possibility of promotions in the next 4-5 years. My parents feel I should complete my degree least I waste the time spent. 

Oh and here's the kicker, I'm going for biology rather than CS or related. I've changed majors multiple times and I'm nowhere near graduating. I'd have at LEAST two, if not three years to go. On the bright side, I do have all my prerequisites out of the way.

The issue is my work schedule precludes classes, I work 8-5 and most classes are between that time. I can manage a few after hours, but that's about it. I've already asked and my work isn't going to adjust my schedule so I can go to class.

So where do I go from here?

I've been doing IT stuff for years, both for clients and family. I find myself enjoying it... but I just.. I just don't know if I should move on from it. Everyone around me has said ""you need to get your degree."" I do hope to one day run a business, IT related or not."

About me: I had a very hard time struggling at first to land an internship for industry penetration, which is why I  want to give back and see if I can help out some people. But I've since had better success with multiple internships + job offers after graduation. One of the most important things is being able to present your accomplishments &amp; capabilities effectively. Of course if you have nothing at all to present then that's a different problem

If you are interested:

PM ME your resume with personal information redacted. Also only PM me if you have at least some experience whether it be personal project / school project. Have something that you can talk  &amp; elaborate about.


I'll get back to you on a good time &amp; further details.

I have background with cad modelling + validation , cs: web front end - ajax / communication , back end - scaling, load balancing , security. So I can ask relevant questions for those topics.

2e3j7g,2,2014-08-20,Not Sure Whether to do Accelerated Grad School Program or Not,bkzhotsauc3,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2e3j7g/not_sure_whether_to_do_accelerated_grad_school/,"So I got told I am eligible in applying for my school's 4+1 Accelerated Program which I am sure you guys are familiar with. I'm currently at my internship and I asked 2 engineers what they thought I should do and they leaned towards getting some job experience so I know what to Master in and also have a company pay for my Master's.

At the moment I am headed into my junior year and yea quite frankly I would have no idea what to master in. I know I am definitely not into purely hardware and I don't think I am into purely software either hence why I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering. All I know is that i do want to get involved the tech world for sure and contribute to the advancement of technology.

I have to apply sometime during my junior year for the accelerated program so should I just wait it out? Maybe not do it at all and just focus on getting that first job after college to get a better idea of what I like doing? If my college won't help me out with paying for the Master's then I don't think I'll even do it at all because I know its common for an engineer's masters to be paid for.

Im just confused because I get told having a Masters helps out for that first job for being qualified and starting pay yet I also hear that a bunch of people who tend to get Masters did it more so because they couldnt get a job they wanted and wanted to beef up that resume. I don't know what to believe and I plan on getting a good internship next summer too so I am sure with my current internship experience and whatever my next one will be, it'll help me stand out.

I don't plan on getting a Phd or any academia stuff like that, I just want to know the guidelines of getting a Masters vs. not getting one.

2e3tm4,1,2014-08-20,Need some advice for college,Super_Zac,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2e3tm4/need_some_advice_for_college/,"Hello redditors, I am in need in some advice regarding college. I'm going to be a senior in high school this year and I don't know what to do. I have the considerations currently- what I'm good at, what I want to do, and what other people think I should do.     
Here's my problem- I've always had interests in a variety of aspects of digital art and media. My true skill lies in graphic design, I have the beginnings of a good portfolio and I even have a graphic design internship. The problem is that graphic design is not a career path I want to take, for various reasons.      
What I really enjoy doing is 3D modeling, animation, and video game art. I've made several animated shorts and also several small video games, and though my skill in it is nowhere near my graphic design, I enjoy it more and that's what I'd like to study in college.       
The last option that my mother wants me to take is to get a computer science degree. My teacher/mentor backs this up. They seem to think that I'm good with code/math just because I do a lot of web design. The truth is that my coding is sub-par and the only reasons my websites are impressive is because of the visual design aspects of them. I'm not good at code or data structures or algorithms or even remembering which tags to use in which order.      
My mom wants me to go to the local university (almost free with scholarships) and get the CS degree. I really want out of this town and, even though I love them, away from my family. I know it makes sense to save a shitload of money, but I don't even want to do computer science. I'm not skilled in it.       
My mother also keeps telling me that getting an animation degree would be too limiting, and that a CS will allow me to do more. In my eyes, if an animation degree is limiting, a CS would just be limiting in a worse way. I'll end up being a software Dev, not doing what I want to.       
I understand that because my parents will be chipping in for college (they promised me $5000 a year) that they get a say, but I don't want to spend 4 years on a degree in the city I spent my entire life in.        
It just makes no sense- you spend my entire life encouraging me to express myself with art, i go to a magnet high school for 4 years where I study graphic design and animation, and now you want me to abandon all of those dreams for a different path that *might* lead to game design in some distant future?     
Sorry for the long post. This kind of turned into /r/off my chest. Any advice appreciated. Also sorry for typos- I hate writing long things on mobile."
2e3ya8,1,2014-08-20,What type of position should I get while trying to get into the game industry?,WolfBro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2e3ya8/what_type_of_position_should_i_get_while_trying/,"This Fall is my last quarter at university. I've been working another internship this summer and realized I hate what I am doing and I'm going to stop telling myself ""I can't do it"" and try to follow my dreams of making games for a living. 

So my question is what type of new grad development position should  I look for that would help the most on the path of becoming a game developer? Since it's very unlikely I'll be able to get something in the industry right out of college.

Here are some facts about my experience.

* I will be getting a BS in Computer Science from UCSD
* I will have 5 internships of experience in the technology industry (1 IT, 1 QA and 3 software engineering)
* I am working on my own game right now and trying very hard to have it finished to use as a portfolio piece for trying to get a job in the game industry.
* I will have school/hobby experience in 2D and 3D graphics (OpenGL)

I spend most of my free time either working directly on my game or reading game dev material. So really the only thing left is to try getting the most relevant experience in my first post-graduation job. That is specifically what I am seeking advice over. I have one friend who is a lead programmer at Rockstar and I'm hoping having him as a networking resource/reference will also help but otherwise I don't have any network seeds to draw upon.

Thanks all.

Edit: Right now my best guess is just trying to find some kind of junior C++ position.

Edit: For anyone else wondering, I was talking to my Rockstar friend and his advice was to learn C++ in and out, which means getting a C++ job would probably be the most beneficial as I can work on my skill with the language while working a full time job. Otherwise it comes down to what we've all been saying, ""knowing your shit"" and making side projects."
2e43uk,3,2014-08-20,Learning JavaScript or Python to prepare for internships,SafetyNerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2e43uk/learning_javascript_or_python_to_prepare_for/,"I am in college and didn't get a chance to do much computer science related this summer (mainly played around with node.js with mixed success). I have some experience in a lot of different languages but I want to have a least one that I know extremely well. My current focus is getting some type of internship next summer. 

I've narrowed it down to Python and Javascript. I'm planning on doing some projects with them and going through some of the typical data structures and algorithms in preparation for interviews (and my own knowledge).

Some thoughts:

* I like the look and feel of Python. 
* There seem to be more open source opportunities for Python.
* Python seems less quirky than Javascript and thus easier to learn.
* It seems like there are a lot more Javascript oriented opportunities (basically anything in web-dev). Though I am not sure how much they care about Javascript experience for internships. 
* I think Javascript would be easier to make complete projects with (just webpages). 
* The pervious summer I had worked using Drupal (a CMS) so I have some listable experience already involving the web so I feel like if I did some javascript stuff the two might look good as a package. 
* Lastly a big issue with javascript for me is that it seem like there is so much more I would have to learn (DOM, languages built on top of JS, JQuery, etc) that it seem like I might not really be qualified for much if I just learn javascript. 

Any help in deciding between these to languages would be great thanks!"
2e46p2,132,2014-08-20,Something happened at the ER,tutututtuu,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2e46p2/something_happened_at_the_er/,"I'm sorry if what I'm writing is a bit inconsistent, but I'm exhausted. I haven't slept much. I'm also still trying to process what has happened.
I'm currently doing an internship at the ER. Yesterday was my second night shift and something weird happened. 
I've been on the ER for a couple of weeks now, but they have all been shifts during the day. Long hours, but I learn a lot. And I have seen a lot. I even got to reanimate someone.

Anyway, yesterday I arrived at 8 pm. It was still pretty busy when I arrived. Lots of minor injuries. Cuts and fractures. Nothing special. Around 10 pm it started to calm down, and between 11 and 12 pm there has only been one patient. A drunk guy that banged his head against something. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Around 1 am, I have been sitting talking with the doctor and some nurses for over an hour. I was lucky it was a cool doctor that night. One that let me do a lot and gave me a lot of explanation when needed. As an intern you often just have to shut up and listen. After talking for over an hour I started to become tired. So I asked if it was alright if I would sleep for a couple of hours. As an intern I had a small small room on the 4th floor with a bed and a bathroom. So I could sleep on night shifts when there was nothing to do. 
The doctor looked at the clock and said it was alright. He said he also was going to sleep for a little while.

So I went to the room and soon fell asleep. A little later I woke up because of my phone. It's a cell phone I need to always keep with me so they can call me if there is an emergency. But when I answered it, I didn't heard the nurse I usually hear, but a weird cracking sound. It was like someone was talking, but I couldn't hear it behind the cracking. I concentrated so I might understand some words. But to no avail. 
After a minute the sound suddenly stopped. 
I didn't really know what to do at that point. I was tired, I just woke up. I tried calling the doctor or the nurses to hear if they called me. Maybe there was an emergency, but the phone was broke. I tried calling them both, but none of them picked up the phone. By then, it was around 4.30 am.
I figured I should go downstairs to the ER and see what's happening.

 When I arrived, the first thing I noticed is that there were almost no lights. Only one in five lights were working so it was pretty dark. But at that time, I didn't think a lot about it. Maybe it was standard that this happens during the night. Or the power went out and the emergency power was working. I wasn't freaked out then. But I started to feel nervous when I couldn't find anyone. The doctor was not in his office, and there was nobody in the kitchen. There wasn't even anybody in the cabinet to welcome new patients. Although this is very important for the triage. 
At that point I started to get confused. There is always somebody here. It is possible that the doctor goes to sleep, but there are always nurses here. And now I couldn't find anybody.

I concentrated and try to listen. Maybe I could hear someone talking or walking somewhere.
But all I could hear was some humming from the lights and the computers. 
At that point I got a little bit scared. Not freaked out. But I was in the middle of the night in an empty hallway in a hospital and I was all alone, so I felt a bit uncomfortable. I tried calling the nurse again. For a moment I thought she had answered. But all I could here was the cracking sound again. I tried talking, saying I could hear something through the phone, but couldn't understand anything in the hope there was someone at the other end of the line and he or she could hear me. But the sound just kept going without pausing, so I assumed the person on the other end of the line probably couldn't hear me. If there was an other person.

The sound continued again for a minute and then suddenly stopped. I walked again to the office of the doctor and the kitchen to see if someone was there. I even walked outside for a second. Sometimes some nurses would smoke there. But there was nobody. I didn't know what to do.
I didn't feel like sleeping anymore.
Only then I decided to check the computer. I have my own login and code to see the patient's history. It also shows if there are patients and in what room they are.
Until I saw that there was one patient currently present in room 3. I figured that the doctor and the nurse might be there. So I walked to room 3.

I opened the door in room 3, hoping to finally see someone. There was a child on the examination table and a person was standing with his back to the door and facing the child. But no doctor or nurse was to be seen in the room.
I started to say my usual line when I'm the first one to examine the patient. 'hello, I'm an intern. Is it alright if I examine you and ask a few questions before the doctor is here?'
But I stopped talking in the middle of the sentence. Something was wrong.

The child that I saw, wasn't a child at all. It was green. First I thought it was his clothes that were green, but it was his skin. But the head was the worst. If you can even call it a head. I couldn't see a mouth or nose or ears. But the head was full of cuts and holles and some sort of saliva was oozing out of it. I completely froze. I looked at the person standing next to it. Maybe it was a rare medical condition I haven't heard of and the parent was going to give me some explanation. 
Suddenly I heard the weird cracking noise again. The person turned around. When I saw him looking at me, my hart stopped beating.

A face filled with grey bubbles looked at me. Eyes that are pitch black. Completely bald. A mouth with teeth long like needles and black saliva dripping out of it. The cracking sound came out of it mouth. It looked at me for a couple of seconds and then all of a sudden it started to scream, really loud. 
I was frozen with fear. Until the thing came closer to me and swung with his arm. In a reflex I ducked away and it just scratched my hand with its long nails.
Now I suddenly could move again.
I ran away as fast as I could, into the dark hallway.
I don't know why but I ran to the elevator and pressed to go to the 4th floor.

When the doors was closing, I could see the thing going out of room 3 and the child thing was following it crawling over the floor like a wurm. The thing saw me and screamed again. The child crawled with an incredible speed towards me. The doors closed right on time. I could hear some banging and screaming on the door while the elevator moved upwards.
The lights in the elevator started flickering on and off and the elevator itself started shocking. I was afraid it would stop or fall down. Somehow the elevator reached the 4th floor.
I ran to my room, locked the door behind me and barricaded with my bed.

The phone that I still had in my pocket was making the cracking noise again. In panic I opened it up and pulled the battery away. The noise stopped.
And then, I waited. Scared to death. I stood there in my room, eyes fixated on the door. I was sure I would hear the screaming or the crackling sound behind the door.
But nothing happened. I lost all sense of time. 2 hours later, what seems like an eternity, I noticed the sun has gone up, and my room was getting light.
I could hear voices behind the door. No creepy voices, but just nurses and doctors. I didn't trust it at first. But after a while I took the risk and opened the door.

I could see a nurse and a doctor walking through the hallway. Nowhere there was a monster. Slowly I went down, to the ER. 
Everything was normal again. There was light, there where nurses in the kitchen. I even found the doctor, saying he couldn't sleep and did paperwork in his office the whole night.
He said I looked awful and better go to my home and get some sleep.
So I did. It took a long time before I fell asleep but I could sleep some hours. I started to think it was all a bad dream.
But I still got a scratchwound on my hand. And some brown stuff on my white jacket. I think it's some of it saliva that got on my when it screamed.

Anyway, I'm back at the ER right now. And it's getting late. There aren't any patients anymore. But I just saw that a new patient entered in the ER on the pc, and it's the same name as yesterday. I don't know what to do now."
2e4ca2,2,2014-08-20,I think I may have ruined my life in 5 minutes,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2e4ca2/i_think_i_may_have_ruined_my_life_in_5_minutes/,"I'm a university student who has been working at a high profile company during the summer in consulting. I'm one of 6 interns and this is my last week. I've been working here for 4 months I definitely have a reputation for doing good work amongst the people I work with. I stay later than most of the other interns almost every day and I feel I'm at least as capable as the others. If a full time job were based solely on the work I've done I think I'd have no issues.

The company is trying something new where they have all the coops do a 10 minute presentation. We were supposed yo talk about what we learned, what we have to offer and why we want to work there. I think they made us do it because they wanted to hire people who can go on to be consultants instead of technically good introverts. The presentation was in front of each other as well as the two heads of our department, someone I would call a rising star in the office and the person in charge of all the interns.

Yesterday we had the presentation and it was nothing short of a disaster. I volunteered to go first and I started out well but I missed one of the points I wanted to say and it just snowballed from there and I lasted maybe 4 minutes. They asked me some questions that I answered maybe satisfactorily but I could tell they were disappointed. The other interns went after me and while none of them did great they were all a big improvement over me.

The thing is, I'm not a shy person. I'd even consider myself outgoing, definitely more outgoing than most of the other interns. I think the reason I did so badly is because I put an enormous amount if pressure in myself to do well. I made it out the be that my performance on this presentation would define my entire life and I just crumbled. 

Today I asked the person in charge of the interns to talk and she obliged. I don't work with her but she has spoken to the people I do work with and I can tell she said she was surprised I did so poorly based on what they had said. I explained to her what happened I think she understood. She confirmed that the presentation would be a large part of theit hiring processes and asked me to try and talk to one of the heads of the department as he makes the final call. 

I emailed him asking to discuss but he's not in today so I'm expecting that he he'll respond tomorrow. I also asked the rising star to talk and he said we can tomorrow afternoon. Its a pretty big company so neither of them have much of an impression of me outside of my disastrous presentation.

I really hope I can fix this. In this industry it doesn't look good to work for a summer somewhere and then not get hired back. It would be a great job and I've been working my whole life for a good starting position. Theres no doubt that not getting this job would hurt me greatly and may be pivotal in my life. I would hate myself if 5 minutes of nerves threw it all away.

I'm typing on my phone so I'm sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors. I hope you can understand the gyst of it. Thank you so much in advance for the advice."

**NOTE**: If only this was a story of a crazy woman who wanted to blackmail me, I would be the happiest man in the world. It certainly is not. And I certainly am not. 

**NOTE**: This story took place five years ago. Thank you for your understanding

As soon as I saw the photos I knew that Celeste had been stalking me, but why? She looked very professional and successful and used the excuse of a “client meeting” to leave the hotel earlier than me. Why would she want to stalk me? I mean, we literally just met, there’s no reason for any of this to be happening. 

In order to avoid questions, I took the box out to the garbage, hid the photos in my jacket pocket and returned to the dinner table. As soon as I returned, Ambrose’s questions about my practice, my patients, and my potential for advancement started flowing. He ran an extremely successful software company and the wife he bought, I mean “fell in love with,” was the perfect trophy wife, fake tits and all. I was and never would be able to live up to Ambrose’s expectations of me, but the best part was that I didn’t give a shit. 

We finished our dinner and faked polite conversation for the remainder of the evening. Four bottles of wine and one poorly executed game of poker later, Ambrose and his wife left. We walked them to their car and said a hasty goodnight. My wife went back into the house and started the process of cleaning up, while I stayed outside, sucking down another cigarette, trying to wrap my mind around what Celeste wanted from me. 

As I stood there, lost in a mixture of thought and worry, a green Honda Civic stopped in front of my house. We lived on a relatively busy street so cars coming and going was never a surprise to me, but the pictures and the encounter with Celeste had put me on edge. As I stared at the car, the window slowly rolled down. Celeste was sitting in the driver’s seat. 

She turned towards me and smiled. I stood there, not certain what I should do. How did she know this much about me? How long had she been driving around my neighbourhood waiting for me to come outside, and finally, what the fuck did she want from me? 

I raised my hand and waved at her, while slowly walking down the steps towards the asphalt of the driveway. As soon as I set foot on the drive, she did up the window and drove away. Again, more questions, and again little to no answers. At this point I was truly terrified. Was my family in danger? I had seen what the upper level of stalking could lead to, and had treated a woman who two years ago was murdered by a stalker who no one, myself included, really believed existed. She was deeply disturbed and was prone to making up stories about people she believed played primary roles in her life: a mother who ran an oil company (her mother had been dead for years), a father who viciously beat her (she was prone to self injury; her father had left when she was a child), and a boyfriend who abused her whenever he drank (she had never been in a relationship, but rather used the fictitious boyfriend as a cover for her self-harm). 

One day I got a call, another member of the rehab facility that she had spent a few months in had found where she lived, stalked her for weeks and then killed her. Something about an outstanding grudge. 

Was Celeste going to try and harm my family? At this point I was confronted with the worst choice that I have had to make: tell my wife I cheated and that the woman was following me, or remain quiet and put my family at risk. 

I made the wrong choice.

I decided to keep it quiet, hoping that Celeste would eventually let up and leave me alone. I didn’t know why I thought this was a good idea, maybe I didn’t want to jeopardize my life. Sure, our marriage was virtually over, but you grow accustomed to a standard of living and the idea of paying my wife alimony for the rest of my working career was just too much. Call me an asshole, but you have no idea the toll that being the final arbiter between mental health and collapse can be. The idea that I would give my life to help others and that miserable woman would de facto entitled to my money, it was too much to bare in that situation.  

I returned inside the house, four cigarettes and 20 minutes later, closed the door and braced myself against it. I could see that my wife had finished in the kitchen and had made her way upstairs. I sat in the living room, once again slightly drunk from the wine and exhausted from the day (and lack of sleep from the night before).

I eventually fell asleep in the living room. It wasn't unusual for that to happen, and when I woke up, I realized that my wife or one of the kids had covered me. I removed the blanket, and went into the foyer. I needed another cigarette, health be damned. I thought that the sleep would clear my mind, but all it did was fill me with even more terrible thoughts. 

I slowly opened the door, not out of apprehension, but out of mental exhaustion. Every task was becoming harder and harder, how was I going to do my job? My patients needed me, and I was spiraling into depression.  

The night was cooler than I was planning for, the smoke had to be quick. As I stood on the porch, staring at the street, I was happy that most of the cars seemed familiar. I could see that the neighbour’s daughter was home from University, her car was in the drive, and that Mr. And Mrs. Thompson-Fitch, retired lawyers that lived across the street, had guests over. They entertained frequently, so their drive and the street abutting it was often filled with cars. 

As I smoked the cigarette my mind wandered to my workload for the next day: get to work, do my rounds, meet my new patients, 3pm meeting with two of my interns. Regular day. Regular life. I hoped. 

I crushed out the cigarette and stood there a while longer, I could have been overreacting. Maybe she didn’t mean me harm, but to take pictures and to deliver them like that. Just then the green Honda Civic turned the corner onto my street. Once again, it slowed to a stop in front of my house and the window rolled down. It wasn’t Celeste, it was an Indian man who turned towards me and beckonned me to the car. What the hell was going on? 

I left my porch and made my way down the drive. As I approached the car I could see that it was empty and a strong odour of marijuana emanated from the open window. 

**Me**: How can I help you? 

**Richard**: My name is Richard, how are you this morning Sir? 

He had a thick Guyanese accent, a calming Caribbean lilt, and he was right, I looked at my watch and realized that it was around 330am.

**Me**: I’m well, what would you like? 

**Richard**: Here you are Sir, they asked me to give you this. They will be in contact. Enjoy your day 

He handed me a manila envelope, thick and padded. I extended my left hand into his car and took it from him. He did up the window and drove away. I stood in the street just staring at the envelope and at the car as it receded down the road. Suddenly a loud BEEEEEPPP from an approaching car jolted me back to reality and I dodged out of the street back onto my property. It was too dark to make out what was written on the envelope, so I made my way into the house and into the bathroom where this had all started. I could hear my daughter’s footsteps walking upstairs, she was such a light walker, it was easy to pick her out. 

As I turned the envelope over, I realized that I should probably not open it. What if it was a contagion, what if it was anthrax, what if. Oh fuck it, I couldn’t be bothered anymore. I  read the writing on the exterior: Dr. J. Stanton, Private. I ripped open the envelope and looked inside; no white powder, so at least it wasn’t anthrax. 

Again, I could hear my daughter walking around upstairs, what the hell was she doing up so late? 

There was only a sheet of paper. I took it out of the envelope, read it and panicked. All it said was: **We’re in the house. Don’t scream.** 

I burst out of the bathroom and ran up the stairs, taking them 2 at a time. My heart was pounding and my smoker’s lungs were not happy with what I put them through. I ran to my daughter’s bedroom. She was fast asleep in her bed. Then on to my other two children, accounted for, perfectly sleeping. I then went to the master bedroom on the third floor. I could see that the light in the hall outside of the room was on. As I approached the door, I tried to make as least noise as possible. What would have happened if I screamed. 

As I approached the bedroom door, I could see my wife was asleep, and everything seemed to be ok. I turned around and noticed that the light inside of the walk-in closet was left on. My wife was very environmental and never left lights on, the hallway was one thing, but the closet was a different story. I knew that something was in there. Waiting for me. 

I reached for the doorknob, firmly placing my right hand on it. As I went to turn, I could feel that someone on the other side was turning the knob. My heart sank. This was it, here we go.

I took my hand off, and just stood there, why hadn’t I brought a weapon. The door swung open and standing inside of the closet was a man. I had never seen him before. He was standing at the entrance of the closet, in a bespoke tailored suit. Perfectly put together. He had one finger over his lips indicating that I shouldn’t say anything or scream. I was in shock to the point where I didn’t know what to do. No sound would have left me at that point, even if an anvil had fallen onto my foot. 

He then raised his right hand and beckoned me closer. I could feel a magnetic pull from this man, what the fuck was going on with my life? 

As I walked closer, realizing that it was only him and I, he raised his left hand, handed me another envelope, doffed his hat, and walked out of the closet. I followed him, as quickly as I could, leaving the closet and then the bedroom. As I got into the hall, I could see him quickly descending the stairs, and leaving out of the front door. I ran to the door and locked it. I turned to the alarm system to enable it, only to realize that it had never been disabled. This man had entered my home, for god knows how long, and managed to trick my overpriced alarm system into allow him so to do. 

I made my way back to the second floor and sat on the landing near the stairs. I wasn’t going to let my children be placed in danger. This was it, it was the last time, and I was going to call the police. Fuck this. 

I turned over the manila envelope, once again padded, and once again embossed with “Dr. J. Stanton, Private,”  on it. I shook it, no noise. I ripped off the top and looked inside. There were two pictures and one letter. 

The first picture was of my daughter, Elizabeth, walking home from school. She went to the Havergal school, and walked home every day. The second picture was of my wife, sitting in her office at the school where she was principal. In both of the images, they were staring directly at the camera, my daughter even looked like she was smiling. They knew that their picture was being taken. 

The part that made no sense to me whatsoever, well the part that made the LEAST sense, since nothing seemed to make sense anymore, was the timing of these pictures. 

My daughter had been on summer vacation for more than three weeks, she hadn’t been in her uniform the entire time, yet there she was in the picture, staring directly into the lens, smile beaming.The same was true of my wife's picture. She had not been at her office for more than 10 days, yet the picture showed her sitting at her desk. Smiling.

I reached for the letter that came with the pictures, and like the others, it had very few words, but the few that were there made realize that I was in true trouble.

2e4wgl,1,2014-08-20,How to break away and start living an independent life?,frivolities,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2e4wgl/how_to_break_away_and_start_living_an_independent/,"I recently graduated from college and just moved back into my parents' house. It's been rough, but I finally have a part time job, a virtual internship, and working on a few theatrical productions in progress. Unfortunately, my job gives me four or five on-call shifts a week and they haven't told me to come in for any of them. I am not making any money and it feels like I am never going to get on my feet. Also, the theatrical productions I am involved in take up a LOT of my time and I will be paid very very little for the entire process. 

I really want to make the jump and get out of my parents house. I have had a depression spell for awhile and being in this house with all of my past constantly being pushed in my face is a struggle. The friends I've been hanging out with are also living in their parents' houses and most of them are depressed, which doesn't really help improve my mood at all. 

I feel like I'm tied down to so many commitments that I can't breathe. I am tied down to my family. I am tied down to my friends. I am tied down to my job, my internship, my theatrical productions....etc. I am one of those people who never quits. I will always follow through, even when it sucks ass. 

How do I break away?"
2e5391,2,2014-08-20,Guidance for personal project.,Eire_Banshee,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2e5391/guidance_for_personal_project/,"Im a CS student and Im about to start on my first real personal project. Essentially, the program is going to be a character generator/set of Dungeon master tools for Dungeons and Dragons written in c#.

Ive ran tests for each aspect of the project and know how its going to work, with the exception of one part. I am using SQLite to manage a database of items/feats/skills/characters/etc. Information from the database is pulled to populate a .pdf character sheet for the player/DM.

Through my internship, I have become pretty proficient with SQL. Although I interact with databases every day and know the structure very well, I have never actually created or managed one.

I want the database to be hosted online, or on my raspberry pi over a local network. One user (The DM) would manage the database, while the other players just pull information from it to populate their character sheet. For example, a player finds a longsword, so their program would find longsword from the weapons table and add it to their inventory on the .pdf.

Does anyone have any advice/direction/tutorials on how I could best go about the connectivity aspect of the program? Preferably using SQLite, but I'm open to alternatives.

TL;DR: I need a good tutorial or hints for hosting a SQLite/MS SQL server database that can be accessed through a LAN(RasberryPi) or online(Web Server?)."

I'm graduating a year sooner because I had Ap credit and took summer classes. Anyway, after my first year I got a summer internship with a fairly large company (over 2,000 employees internationally) in Atlanta where I live and go to school. They brought me on as an intern to build webapps. 3 of which are active in production. My starting pay was and still is 12 bucks an hour. Since that summer they've kept me under the same title ""intern"" as I work part-time and remain a full time student. But since that summer I've been moved around on different projects within the company writing Java apps, SQL scripts, and at one point a full system Integration test suite. Its been 1 year and 4 months since I've started and the main reason I've stayed is because my boss is really cool. He works around my school schedule, let's me take exam days off, and even allows me to work remotely every now and then. Im debating whether I should venture off and find another internship before I graduate. Or ride this out until graduation. (Note: I really don't think I could see myself pursuing a career in Java development). What do you guys think?"
2e5svp,3,2014-08-21,WTF should I do with my life,fazzybadger,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2e5svp/wtf_should_i_do_with_my_life/,"Ive gone through a rough year. By no means has it been that bad, but some depression anxiety issues, quitting my pretty good job in project management, leaving my GF of almost 7 years, getting back together with gf, helping gf move to Austin for PHD internship and staying back home in Madison, WI, and still not technically employed have all made it pretty damn difficult to make important decisions. 

I'm on top of the anxiety depression issue with therapy and just accepting that this is how life is at the current moment. 

My relationship is good, but not great. Mainly because we just cant figure out if we want to get married. GF is from Chi, I'm from just outside of Madison. GF is Jewish, I was raised Catholic but no longer practice, however my family just doesnt get it. GF will be a PHD in Counseling Psychology and accepts that her career path may require moving wherever for her career and she does not want to have anything to do with Madison anymore after 10 yrs of school, I love Madison and would be completely happy spending the rest of my lift in the area... You get the point, we are different, but we also have invested a lot of time in each other, and we both will love each other until were six feet under...especially on her end.

Career wise, I have not found a full-time gig since I quit my job in May of 2013. This has had a significant impact both financially and mentally but I am fortunate to have enough help to scrap by. I am a UW grad in economics but i pretty much half assed college just to get a degree, and then I graduated in 2009 during the great recession (not trying to make excuses, but not caring much about college made this even more difficult) I'm a pretty capable person I like to think, growing up with gogetter/DIY parents. I would say Im above average in many categories (this may sound narcissistic, but it seems much of my generation is either book smart or common sense smart and I am a good bit of both) 

My biggest problem is that I dont have any idea what I want to do, and I often have a really hard time figuring out who I am these days.

Anywho, that's kind of a quick summary of my life so far, and now here is the (maybe a little pathetic?) bit of advice I am asking for.

Everyone in my life says I need to get a job. I make a lot of money right now working for friends and family doing painting, landscaping, etc... but not enough to pay the bills on a consistent basis. I definitely agree with them that I need to get a job, I am just struggling with figuring out what to do. Start a small business, Find a professional gig here even though I might be moving in the next year to wherever GF ends up at, or just get a job and figure that all out later. One thing is for sure, I intend on going to graduate school in the next 7 years.

I need advice with which of the following 3 I should choose ASAP

1. Offered a FedEx delivery driver job at 40K per year. Enough to scrap and something I wouldnt feel that bad about walking away from sooner than later.

2. Financial services professional for MassMutual. This is what I was originally going to do out of college, in Madison (my hometown...lots of connections). I interned for the same agency in college and have maintained a relationship with the VP of sales. I think im very capable of succeeding in this setting, its just hard to decide if I should commit to this when I may move soon...

3. Start a small business doing what I do now, home services, painting, handyman work by going all in. I certainly am competent enough to make this a somewhat successful venture, just might not have the dedication.

With all of that mumble jumble, I need YOUR advice with what I should do. Sorry for such a long post, but if you took the time to read most of it, pleaseee lemme know what you think I should do.

THANK YOU

2e6tk0,5,2014-08-21,Tips on finding an internship when you are about to graduate and have only basic German skills?,vv999,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2e6tk0/tips_on_finding_an_internship_when_you_are_about/,"Hi everyone! I am an international student from an EU-country about to graduate my masters degree from a German university. I am now writing my master thesis and looking for an internship and find it extremely hard. I've been reading lots around here for this and and would like to share my experience in the hope that you might also have some tips about this. I am really personalizing my applications and trying to match their requirements with my skills, but I am having trouble getting even invited to an interview. So here it goes, my confessions about internship applications:

**Applying in German vs English**
First of all, which language do you think it's appropriate to send the documents in? Most of internships require fluent, business fluent or very good German. Although I've been learning for 2 years now, my current level is B2, which is not enough, not even for writing a decent cover letter in an appropriate tone. Some of job posts are advertised in German, and specify no German skills per se in the requirements, but I have a feeling that they do expect you to know it. I tried as much as possible to send my documents in German, but as I am writing a different cover letter for each job, I can't keep bugging everyone all the time to double check my application. I mean I do it, but at some point I feel like I am annoying my friends. 

**No work experience whatsoever**
What about initial work experience? Even internships require that you've ideally had already an experience before. Where to start then, if everyone requires this? 
Later edit: my experience is pure academic and I have lots of extra-curricular involvement plus a small business on the side. However I jumped into masters directly after bachelor, so mostly focused on academia. 

**Are grades important**
Why does everyone require above average grades? I see it in 50% of the job ads, at least in the one for really big companies. My GPA is around 2.5, do you think that plays an important role?

**Student status**
Do you still have to be a student to be considered for an internship? I got a call from a company the next day after I sent my documents, telling me they can't consider me because according to their regulations I am already a graduate (although I am still writing my thesis and am registered as a student)

Last but not least, I keep hearing that this is a number's game. So what is more important, sending a lot of applications, or sending fewer, but more qualitative applications? 

Finally, I have friends that keep telling me to try applying through referrals. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone, as I am applying all over Germany. What are the chances of making it only through individual applications?

Later edit: To be more specific I'm trying to get into IT Consulting/IT Project Management with a Msc in Information Systems Economics (Wirtschaftsinformatik) and a BSc in Engineering acquired from my home town university.

Thanks in advance you guys. Would be really helpful to hear your thoughts on the job-hunt process!

My grades are quite good and I do a lot of studying on my own like learning other languages and algorithms. But I have not really worked on any published projects and my school does not offer any coops or internship help. I also know that not a lot of companies take an Associates in CS seriously. 

Having said that, there anything I can do now to get noticed in the intern world or should I just wait until I transfer? How did you manage to score your first internship/job/etc.? "

In the second year, we are exposed to a few programming courses which I found much more interesting than the IT courses.  Now I have a year left, so I am wondering if I should change my major to CS which means I'd have to spend an extra year (I dont really want to) or should I just complete my IT degree and work on side projects to put on my resume. I am currently doing an internship where I do IBM server configurations. With this on my resume, I dont think it would help to crack into the software field. Any thoughts?  "
2e7xc2,3,2014-08-21,Should I mention untreated ADHD as an explanation for poor GPA?,addprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2e7xc2/should_i_mention_untreated_adhd_as_an_explanation/,"Hey everyone, I've got a kind of unique situation and I was wondering if anyone had some relevant advice. I graduated a year ago from a top 30 university with a computer science and math degree. My GPA was about a 2.8 with grades all over the place and I never did any real internships. (I know, not good). After I graduated I felt pretty burnt out and procrastinated on the whole job application process until I eventually went to see a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with moderate to severe inattentive ADHD. Since then I've been going to therapy and taking medication and its done wonders for me.  Now, here I am, over a year after graduating, and I'm looking to find work. 

My question was whether it's a bad idea to explain all of this in interviews. I know a lot of people say never to mention any sort of mental illness in interviews since it will just raise red flags and that makes sense to me. However, I feel like in my situation it provides a good explanation for why an employer could expect better work from me than my resume and GPA would indicate (and I do honestly believe that to be true).

Anyway, thanks for reading, and thanks for any advice that you may have."

2e8kqi,495,2014-08-21,How My Dad (And An Intern) Fixed a Software Issue That Plagued The Company For Years,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2e8kqi/how_my_dad_and_an_intern_fixed_a_software_issue/,"This is a story of my Dad and an intern fixing a design flaw in their company's software that had plagued them since the very beginning.

Now, whisk yourself back to the early 2000's. My Dad (who will be known in conversations as D) was working at a server software
company with a team of software engineers that included the Junior software engineer (JSE or simply E in conversations) that fixed this flaw. Now, what was this flaw you may ask? Well, the software was supposed to showcase how good the servers were.

This sounds like a fairly simple idea (even to someone like me who knows squat). The problem was that when you had to install it it took
**TWO FUCKING HOURS** to install completely. And what's even worse than that is the software would often install wrong, so you would have to uninstall, then reinstall it.

As you could have imagined, this drove everyone INSANE. People refused to work with it, it was so bad. One day, my dad talked to the JSE and asked him what was wrong with it.

&gt;D: JSE, why does this software take so long to install? Everyone else just tells me it's a long story.

&gt;JSE: Well, the software utilizes Java, right?

&gt;D:Right...?

So, long story short, the code would display something like this every time it was installed

    Starting Java  
    Importing Item1
    Shutting Down Java
    Starting Java
    Importing Item2
    Shutting Down Java

Rinse and repeat for two hours, and it's finally done!

This is something you'd expect from a novice or a starting intern with no experience. Well, my dad says that it may have been a case of an intern being shown the first 3 lines of code as an example, and being told to do that for the rest of the resources. And of course, the lazy/uneducated intern simply copied and pasted the first three lines of code, simply changing which item was being imported.

My Dad asked the engineer if he could fix it in his spare time, and he agreed. See, this JSE was (stereotypically) East Indian, and was going on a trip back with his wife (another software/tech savvy person). He would work on it on the plane with his wife the way there and back.

Fast forward a month, and the JSE is back with good news.

&gt;D: So, how'd you do?

&gt;JSE: Not bad. I got the install time to under a minute.

&gt;D: **WHAT?**

Yes, ladies and gentlemen. By eliminating the tedious process of repeatedly opening and closing Java, JSE eliminated approximately *one hour and 59 minutes* off the install time. This somehow also solved a lot of the bugs that would come up after install.

All I know past this point is that the company (after some corporate red tape for the L0Lz) finally rolled out this new format. I hope you have enjoyed my first post on TFTS, have a safe walk home, and a good day. *Bows*

EDIT: My Dad's role came when they (his team) had to show the higher ups the new (fixed) software. Sorry for not being clear earlier.

EDIT 2: Wow, front page! Thanks people-who-know-more-than-I!

I want to be doing something that's public service, hands on and preferably outdoors.

2e900j,13,2014-08-22,"No experience, internships, sub-par GPA, irrelevant BS degree. Any chance of getting hired? (rant)",unemployedzen,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/2e900j/no_experience_internships_subpar_gpa_irrelevant/,"I graduated in December of 2013 from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science in COMPUTER ENGINEERING. My degree is a hybrid between computer science (how to program and use computers) and electrical engineering (designing the actual hardware). You'd think that there would be ample opportunities for me, right? Eight months later of applying to anything and everything says... no. The problem I'm facing is nobody wants a hybrid adaptable degree, everyone wants either experience or a BS in EITHER Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. I don't understand enough about algorithms and scripting languages to get hired at programming focused companies, and I don't understand enough about power conversion to get hired at hardware companies, and the few business that actually want somebody with knowledge of both expect a masters degree.

This curse afflicted me during my studies, I could never secure an internship, so that is holding me back harder than anything. Also one semester, I was an alcoholic so my GPA suffered to the point that it could not be salvaged. I tried to work around that by taking difficult graduate level courses that would impress employers, but turns out that they don't care what classes I took, so my GPA ended up at a measly 2.81. Employers only care about the words on my degree, internships, and my GPA, all of which are sub-par.

Currently I'm slowly going insane living in my parent's basement. Long story short, our religious views and ideological views no longer mesh, and my dad expects things to be just as easy for me as it was for him when he graduated 40 years ago, so he sees my lack of employment as a lack of competence on my part. I want to get hired, I need to get hired, but apparently promising phone interviews and never calling is now common practice amongst employers.

Forgive me, this has turned into a rant. Ban me if necessary. Perhaps I should just bite the bullet, accept my fate, and apply to McDonalds or Wal-Mart.

[This](http://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/courses/c10148) is the course I'll be taking, with the major being 'Enterprise Systems Development major'. 

That said, I don't plan to make the actual degree my focus, rather I'll be trying to independently learn a few electives through MIT's open course ware. 

Throughout the 3 years I plan to hopefully become decent in a specific field or programming language (probably JavaScript, SQL or PHP as they seem to be in demand) and create something! 

So by the end of my degree I hope to have: a decent portfolio, some industry experience (internships), Microsoft exams and of course the actual degree.

I also have a few ideas on apps, web applications or software which I'd like to attempt (contribute towards my portfolio).

So yeah, I plan to work hard and hopefully achieve a job (Australian market for Software Developing seems to be quiet at best, unlike America's which seems to be booming).

Do I stand a chance? Do recruiters care a lot about the prestige of a university, or would a decent portfolio matter more?

My fear is that most employers would treat uni/college grads like how they treat CS degree vs Self taught (I've heard most recruiters don't bother to look at self taught programmers).

I believe I have an interest and passion for the programming world, haven't decided which niche/sector to target (all seem awesome), but hopefully will have a better idea throughout the next few years.

Also, if anyone could skim through a list of electives offered by this university and judge whether it'll meet the criteria of a software developer I'd really appreciate it!

Again, [here](http://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/courses/c10148) is the link.

Scroll down to 'Typical study program' and choose a selection of 'Enterprise Systems Development Major' - which I plan to do.

Things didn't really go as planned my junior and senior year (lots of household problems broke out, depression, etc.) and I later opted to go to a small state school in my area.

I'm hoping to transfer into GATech for Fall of 2016.  By then I'll most likely have 32 - 35 credits - all of which are transferable to Tech.  As of right now I have a 3.94 overall GPA.  I'm taking roughly 2-4 classes a semester --&gt; Fall of 2013 was 3, Spring of 2014 was 2, summer of 2014 was 1, this semester i'm taking 3 classes, spring of 2015 will be 4, summer i'm debating between taking a class or an internship, and fall of 2015 will be 3 (I'm taking calc 2 and physics 1, and I don't want to set myself up for getting a poor grade in calc 2 after everything i've been hearing about it...)

What can I do to help my chances of getting in?  I've talked with a student who works in undergrad admissions who's informed me that the transfer acceptance rate is 28% - making it harder to get in than a freshman.  

Internships and extra circulars won't help me here as far as I understand, but I'm looking to do anything to get in.  

* What do I need to work on to increase my chances of getting admitted?  What should I start doing now?  

* If I do get rejected for the Fall (I understand it's the semester most kids apply for) will I have a significantly higher chance of being admitted for the spring of 2017?  

* Is the difficulty of getting in as a transfer being over-exaggerated by any chance (Is it easier than I thin it is, or am I right to be this paranoid)?  I've called the offices many times in the past, and this is the first time I'm hearing about the 28% transfer acceptance rate.

I live in Brazil and the taxes and rates here are simply amazing. If I buy a used r9 290, it will be at least twice as expensive as a new one on amazon. What I want to try, then, is to have a family member bring the parts when they visit the US next month. It might take two trips though (maybe another family member is going on business by the end of this year), because tax law allows for $500 of merchandise purchased outside the country to enter by plane with a passenger. What I want to do, then, is to order everything I can online. I also want to give priority to whatever can travel safely and whatever will have the biggest price/weight ratio. Probably going to try to find the case here, for example.

I haven't had a PC in ages, and really miss playing games on PC. Just trying to find my way back to Zion, I guess. Trying to find an internship (engineering student), and will probably have to buy parts in a complicated market, so the budget is real.. Don't think I can go a lot over $800. Still have to get a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor.

By the way, are monitors safe to bring in luggage? Or are they too sensitive? Really would like to bring it from there, if at all possible. Might not be, though, and it will murder my wallet and all its children.

I know the processor is not that seen in this sub, so I've been wondering about it. I'd also like to include an SSD in there, and I think the 280x might be enough, though not sure. 1440p sounds awesome if I can, but if I buy the monitor in Brazil, it'll probably be way above my budget. The monitor alone would cost more than the entire build (wish to God I was joking. Just checked, the cheapest I found was over $1000).

I was ecstatic to see your posting for a intern on the UNIVERSITY undergraduate communications students forum, and I am very interested in taking on this position. As a budding professional in the public relations industry, I am extremely motivated to learn all the mechanics and workings of the industry. Like COMPANY, I aim to not only meet but improve on any objectives and strive to become an integral part of your agency.


Through my work as a cafe manager for the past four years, I have been exposed to a number of skill sets that I feel has rounded me as an individual and educated me on what it means to be a part of a team. The responsibilities that come with being a cafe manager, including the management of inventory and finances, have taught me the importance of punctuality. Through conflict resolution amongst employees and customers of the cafe, I have developed a very level headed and calm persona which has allowed me to take on a large quantity of tasks without anxiety or stress hindering my abilities to complete my objectives. In addition to this, I have also developed fluid interpersonal skills that allow me to confidently communicate my objectives, relate and sympathize with others.


Although I have obtained many skills whilst working as a cafe manager, it wasn't until I was a successful candidate as an intern at PREVIOUS COMPANY that I was able to see how relative they were to the public relations field. My confidence and can-do attitude catapulted me to success when liaising with clients through both phone calls and emails and allowed me to quickly integrate myself into the environment. Throughout the entire duration of my position at PREVIOUS COMPANY, I was constantly learning what it takes to be a part of the industry and how to better myself and see through to what a client really needs. However, I am aware that my pathway to become the professional I aspire to be is still continuing and I still have many things to learn. It is clear from your client list that your services extend to a smorgasbord of industries and their needs, from Westpac to Coca-Cola Amatil and it is because of this I have decided to apply for an internship position at your agency. 


I hope you find that my aspirations and objectives align with that of COMPANY's and I look forwards to hearing from you soon. 


Kind regards,

I have tried for many internship opportunities but unable to get any positive response. Now, I am not the type to panic, but this is quite serious considering the fact that most of my batchmates are at least four years younger than me and are already placed in good firms. 

I should also probably also mention that I once dropped out of a college midway during my undergraduate course, and in process lost 3 years of progress. 

Any advice would be really helpful."

I will be graduating in December, and I am finishing up my internship at an established software company (ProQuest) in the next week. 

During my final months of school, I'll need part time employment. So far, I've received three part time job offers:

1. Continue work at ProQuest
2. Work at a freshly VC-funded startup
3. Work doing bioinformatics for the university

I already have experience working at a startup (2 years during college) and I have been working at ProQuest for the last 4 months. The bioinformatics job interests me, it also pays the most, is a short walk from my apartment (rather than a short drive), and I'd be working closely with professors in the Computer Science department and Medical School. I go to a top university, so these professors as references would probably carry some weight.

My thinking is that I already have awesome references here at ProQuest, I've done good work and they've straight up told me that they'll only say good things.

At ProQuest though, I'd be working on a large java webapp, whereas the bioinformatics position is more of a DBA/scripting/statistical analysis job. The startup position would be nodejs for a bitcoin-based startup.

I eventually want to work as a software dev at Google in Mountain View (or similar company). 

What should I do, thinking long term, to improve my marketability, skillset?"

I am on my first week of internship for the IT department in my home town government. The IT department is heavily understaffed, basically three people provide support for a network of roughly 250 PCs, updating the main website, managing the servers and so on, so they were pretty happy to have me just to deal with regular User related problems. Few days in I received a call from a lady who I believe works in the department of social services.   
 
&gt;Hello, my computer wont turn on, can you come take a look at it?  

As this was my first official IT related job, I was pretty eager to solve every problem and went straight on. As I entered her office I saw a power cord from her machine unplugged from the socket and a kettle was plugged instead. The conversation went something like this:  

&gt;Mam, who unplugged this power cord?  
&gt;I did, I just wanted to make some tea, is this why my computer wont turn on?  

Needless to say I was speechless, she knew that a kettle needed power to warm up the water, but not that her computer needed power to turn on. From then on I learned to ask the simplest questions first, before taking a walk, even if some people take offence by it.  

I hope you enjoyed this tale, I am sure I will have much more to tell when I finish my degree and get a job in tech support. Forgive my English grammar, I am trying my best."

OK, here is the deal. I live in Brazil and the taxes and rates here are simply amazing. If I buy a used r9 290, for example, it will be at least twice as expensive as a new one on amazon USA. 

I've been gaming on xbox for the last few years, and honestly I miss PC gaming and really want to find my way back. What I want to try, then, is to have a family member bring the parts when they visit the US next month. It might take two trips though (maybe another family member is going on business by the end of this year), because tax law allows for $500 of merchandise purchased outside the country to enter by plane with a passenger. What I want to do, then, is to order everything I can online. I also want to give priority to whatever can travel safely and whatever will have the biggest price/weight ratio. Probably going to try to find the case here, for example.

I haven't had a PC in ages, and really miss playing games on PC. Just trying to find my way back to Zion, I guess. Trying to find an internship now (engineering student), and will probably have to buy parts in a complicated market, so the budget is real.. Don't think I can go a lot over $800. Still have to get a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor.

By the way, are monitors safe to bring in luggage? Or are they too sensitive? Really would like to bring it from there, if at all possible. Might not be, though, and it will murder my wallet and all its children if I'm forced to buy it here.

Those are my main questions, anyway. Would love some advice on what to do, what to order there and what to try and get here. What would be safe to buy used would be nice, since I don't really know what sources to trust.

The build I'm leaning towards is from /r/CabaloftheBuildsmiths , and is this one:

I know the processor is not that seen on /r/buildapc, so I've been wondering about it. I'd also like to include an SSD in there, and I think the 280x might be enough (trying to learn how to understand benchmarks and stuff), though not sure. 1440p sounds awesome if I can, but if I buy the monitor in Brazil, it'll probably be way above my budget. The monitor alone would cost more than the entire build (wish to God I was joking. Just checked, the cheapest I found was over US$1000).

Anyway, as you can see, I really need help. Any advice is welcome.

Previous to me being employed with him, he hired someone in the IT field to backup all his company projects and info on an old PC tower to act as a network server. Recently he became convinced the tower was going to fail so he purchased a ReadyNAS from Netgear. I have set up the ReadyNAS to essential replace the old tower server by transferring all the project files to the NAS. I also set it up to backup every day. 

The problem is some of the files from the old tower server never transferred to the ReadyNAS, at least 6,000 files difference. I went into the folder setting of the old server documents and noticed they were set to read-only (don't know if this is important). Also any information about the ReadyNAS I have tried to look up to better understand all of it's functions is written in techy speak and I am having a hard time understanding what the NAS can do. 

I would like to have all the files copied from the old server to the ReadyNAS, have the NAS automatically backup the new project files everyday and replace old files, as well as set up a backup of all three PCs connected to the wireless network (setting up a backup job is REALLY confusing and it can never find the folder I use as a source).

I stumbled upon this subreddit and found it to be very relatable. I'm going to write about my personal story with growing up with Asian parents and hope some of you have gone through the same stage of (re)discovery of yourself. I'm still discovering my life and what I am. It's hard since i'm not used to risk, failures and deciding for myself. 

I'm 26 Chinese Canadian male who moved to the country in Grade 4. My parents are pretty much what you guys would assume. They don't have any hobbies or true friends. They value competition and hard work and believe life is inherently hard and having fun is a wasting life. They are not interested in integrating into Canadian society nor are they interested in art&amp;culture. They pay little attention on emotional well being and believe in money above all else. 


#***about me section***

You may skip my story section and read my questions at the bottom if you want.


##Childhood

My childhood in Canada was tough and mostly non existent since I didn't know the language and my parents never assisted me in integrating into society. I basically had little life experience outside of school. 

Even up to now my parents don't see how this affects me in a negative way. They always like to brag about how difficult it is for them and I should feel lucky and give back to them.


##Highschool

During this time I strengthened my dual personality where one is for hanging out at school and the other for my parents. 

My parents did not allow me to go out at night and I didn't even think about dating since I felt my family was awkwardly different and couldn't imagine bringing even a friend to my place. My school was largely white and it meant I didn’t meet many people that related to me when it comes to parenting.


##University

It wasn't until university that I had by first drink and went to the first party. For university, I studied engineering like most immigrate kids. I wasn't forced to do it, I picked it because of career prospects and on the social conditioning that it's right for an Asian male with high marks to study engineering. My parents were pretty happy at this point to see me studying something with good career prospects. University was the first I had a drink and went party. Even though I lived on campus I didn't meet so many people since school was stressful and I went home often. People I met were largely Asian and just work hard like I did. 


##Rethinking Years

Into my senior years of university I started to take courses that weren't technical and even thought about switching to other programs. Of course I didn't since it's unimaginable to fail. I then went on a semester aboard in Europe to keep my life interesting. It changed my view of life. I learned to take things easier and that life is not a race. I learned happiness comes first. I learned competitiveness is not necessary good. I made true friends for the first time and had a lot of fun. In contrast my parents were unhappy that I spend money to travel and kept believing it will hurt my employability.

I actually went back to Europe several times since graduation. I felt it was an escape from my parents and I can truly do what I want without worrying the reactions of my parents. On top of this Europeans seemed to treated Asians better especially if you are someone who wants to integrate to their culture. Once I tried to get a job through an internship but didn't work out.  

My parents are obvious not happy with my career decisions and think I’m waste my life away. They are also embarrassed when I travel for extended periods and even lies to people that i'm ""studying"". My peers in engineering school are more successful and many have married yet the idea I’m still wandering around scares them. To be honest it scares me sometimes too since I never failed nor had to made decisions for my life before.


##Current Thoughts

I feel the last few years were a rebellious phase much like how teenagers are portrayed on TV. While much of my past few years has been traveling in between jobs and short stints in Europe. I don't feel like it's going to solve my issues. I still feel completely uncomfortable near my parents. I even don't like to meet women in my home city since I can't imagine how they would react when meeting my parents. That's why I’m always planning an escape whether it be trying to work in a different city or becoming a digital nomad. However it’s true that moving to another place bring it's own set of challenges and traveling can’t sustain physical friendships. Eventually I would I have to return to my parents because they can't possibly take care of themselves without me when they are older. 

#***end of about me section***


------
Did you'all feel you have a lot of experiences and life lessons you missed? What did you do about them?

Is living far away from your parents the best solution? I always enter some sort of depression when I get back to living with my parents it seems to have canceled any progress I made.

I’m putting happiness ahead of career, it’s little scary and I still don’t know how it will all work out in the end. Have some of you fallen from a respectable career only to deal the baggage growing up with Asian parents?"

1) 

 - Communication for IT Professionals

 - Introduction to Information Systems

 - Programming Fundamentals

 - Web Systems

 - Business Requirements Modelling

 - Networking Essentials

 - Applications Programming

2) 

 - Database Fundamentals

 - Data Structures and Algorithms

 - Interface Design

 - Software Engineering Practice

 - Systems Development Project (worth twice as others)


3) 

 - Third year is basically paid internship


4)

 - Project Management and the Professional

 - Choose one from:

Web Services Development

Database Programming

Enterprise Development with .NET

Human-Computer Interaction	

Cloud Computing and Software as a Service

Mobile Applications Development

 - Choose one from:

Web Services Development

Software Architecture

Object-relational Databases

Extreme Programming	

Application Development with .NET

Advanced Internet Programming

Cloud-based Enterprise Application Development

Mobile Applications Development

Application Development in the iOS Environment


**These all would equate to 108/156 credits of the total course, they allow us to pick 48/156 remaining electives ourselves (we can submajor which is 24 credits each in two or major in one, which is 48 credits).** The sets below are each 24 credits, so I'd only be able to choose two of them (e.g. physics and scientific computing, hence ditching data).


So from here on I have a choice in:

Scientific Computing (yes, more CSeey):

 - Computational Linear Algebra
	 
 - Programming for Mathematical Modelling and Data Analysis

and one from these:

Applications of Discrete Mathematics
	 	
Differential Equations	 	

Introduction to Analysis and Multivariable Calculus
	 	
Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems	 
	
Introduction to Quantitative Management	 
		 
Introduction to Statistics	
 	
Stochastic Models


For this, someone said to me there are all intro topics, hence I technically wouldn't be a minor/majoring in it, this is what worries me the most.


Physics:

 - Foundations of Physics

 - Physics in Action

 - Imaging Science

 - and one from each: 

     Advanced Mechanics
	 
     Measurement and Analysis of Physical Processes


Data Analytics:

 - Introduction to Statistics	 
	 	
 - Introduction to Data Analytics

 - and two from these:

Advanced Data Analytics
	 	
Data Visualisation and Visual Analytics	
 	
Image Processing and Pattern Recognition	 
	
Intelligent Agents	 	

Object-relational Databases	
 	
Programming with Patterns
	 	
e-Business Trading




**Right now it's looking like an inferior Computer Science degree at best, I have a feeling after I graduate the stuff I would've learnt wouldn't be enough for developing solutions in software for companies.**

Edit: I'd also like to say that for any deficiencies in the degree I'd be prepared to make up for with self study (e.g. Mit open courseware, textbooks, projects etc). Also will be interested in achieving a Microsoft certificate, perhaps to entice more employers. Basically I just desperately want to get employed."

2ed3yb,123,2014-08-23,Teacher.,AtomGray,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ed3yb/teacher/,"Let's talk about expectations for a minute. Stereotypes. Associations.

What comes to mind when you hear the word ""teacher?"" What do you picture? If that's too broad, think of a ""high school English teacher, male, in his late 20's."" What's he wearing? What did he drive to work? What expression is on his face? 

Now, these exercises are, by nature, reductive - a person is not solely defined by his job title, age, appearance, gender, race. One man can can even have many sides, depending on who he knows is watching. They're reductive, but that doesn't mean that they don't serve a purpose. In college, there was an assignment to list 100 things about someone based on only a few details. This was so that when you wrote a character, called [""The Janitor,""](http://redd.it/2deuf4) without saying anything else about him, you would know how your audience was going to picture them.

Think back to that teacher that you pictured earlier. I'll feed you some details this time. 

This is Charlie. He's wearing the same pale blue button-up for the third day in a row, hoping no one will notice. It's the same shirt he wore to his internships, only with one fewer button, allowing his newly filled out gut to push through. He came to work in the same Volkswagen P.O.S. that he drove away from this high school after he graduated. On his face as he grades an endless pile of shitty book reports isn't an expression. The particular fuse in his brain that controlled facial expression burnt out sometime around 2 am. Now there's just red, and clear beads of fever sweat from a month of living on fast food and the Smirnoff he kept hidden in his desk.

As he scribbles ""F"" on one more paper, the pen fails to stream any more ink. After what's felt like eons of tireless, thankless work, the pen has given up. As it's stabbed into the desk, it collapses under the force and shatters. Clear plastic splinters lodge themselves into the flesh of his hand, the teacher's own red fluid stains the desk like sponge paints, again and again.

The only thing that stops him from tearing apart the desk, the students desks, the windows, the cheesy posters and chalkboard on the the walls, and then going to work on himself is the feeling of eyes pressing on him from the rear of the lecture hall, just out of reach of his small desk lamp. Is it the feeling of eyes, or the barely audible sound of someone breathing heavily?

In the stillness, he can hear it more clearly. It's not a whisper as scratchy as sandpaper and a snake's hiss, it's laughter, coming from a dark shape in the darkness. Staring, straining to see in the dark, he hears the breath catch and go silent.

""Hey! Who's up there?""

*Pop!*

Charlie's alcohol-depressed nervous system reacts without him, flinching away from the tight, hollow sound.

""Come out of there. You're scaring me.""

""Charles?""

Something about the word, fetched from the darkness isn't right. It's too dry-sounding, like the throat that produced it was full of dust-bunnies. It's too round, like the mouth that formed it was too lazy, or lethargic from years of misuse. It's too formal, like it forgot where, or when it was.

These details rattled through Charlie's brain for a moment before being swept away by the sight of something emerging from the darkness.

Two points of light, reflections of the lamp in each lens of a pair of over-sized glasses. A man, hunched and pitted, like he's been dried in the sun. His face is covered in wrinkles like cracks, little spidery voids that expose the black void within. A set of coveralls so ancient, it looks like they're made of purely dirt and dust, swept from some unknown basement.

The further the man comes into the light, the more corpse-like he appears. Eyes are gray and flat, like newspapers.

""Charles Grant?""

Charlie remembers himself and tries to run, but stumbles over his heels, and ends up sitting hard on the desk.

For some reason, despite the toll that years of death has taken, Charlie can just recognize the janitor from when he did his time as a student. After all, it had been the janitor who had cut the lock from the locker on Monday, when he'd been stuffed there on Friday. The janitor who had pulled him down from the flag pole, and cut the duct tape from around his mouth and wrists. It was the janitor who had found Charlie unconscious in the girl's bathroom, covered in blood where a group of kids had broken his jaw and left him.

It doesn't take long before the janitor has found his voice again, and begins telling the new teacher the things he's seen. 

Terrible things. Horrible tales about the seemingly normal and happy families and people who passed through the halls of the school every day. Things that he couldn't have known - that no one could have known.

I am Charlie. Excuse me, ""Mr. Grant.""

This is how I met the janitor. How he came to me, in order that I might finish what he could only dream of starting."

It's simple: I love doing what I'm doing. I have a chance to convince my boss to keep me full-time.

Consider this: I've been working for 3 months, at school I had subjects like algorithms and data structures, computer systems architecture. What should I learn? What are the assets a junior programmer has, as opposed to an intern? I definetely need to learn about databases, but besides that?

Please reddit, any heplful resources, suggestions, tips, opinions, courses, books, will mean the world to me!

Ps.: It's my first post on reddit! WOOHOO \o/"

Unsure of what to do...",9132,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2edpki/fulltime_developer_but_still_have_3_more_years_in/,"I started out as an intern (under a full-time dev and a part-time remote senior dev) last fall at a start-up, but a few months ago I replaced the full-time dev because he got a good offer somewhere else. 

So I'm kind of essential to the company now, and it's fine for now because i'm still in community college just taking a light load (and it's summer) so I can work almost full-time, but I'm worried for when I go to university. It looks like there's less flexibility in class schedule and the classes are all pretty much around 10am-2pm almost every day.

I'm probably safe for now because I have another year at CC, but I'm not sure how I would pull off almost full-time and uni at the same time. And I need a job to pay bills (I live with my gf in an apartment)...

Is university more flexible than it looks? 

Is there part-time dev work out there?

I notice common issues and mental blocks young people have with career planning and job research.

I graduated in 2008 from a good university and couldn't find a job or a career path I was happy to pursue. My early 20s was an exhaustive mix of different roles and industries. I have worked at a ski resort, hedge fund, movie studio, eCommerce store and now a top tech company. Along they way, I found a career I like and picked up skills and experiences that keep my options open.

I am sharing a couple private emails I wrote with tips that helped college students and recent grads figure out what they want to do. I hit some low points after I graduated college and feel there is not enough specific and helpful career advice for young people, so I am happy to help in any way. If I get positive feedback, I may turn this into a larger guide with more tactics. Maybe explore specific industries and jobs.

If this helps you, I would love to hear about your situation, career issues, and goals. You can message me on reddit too. 


** Career guidance starts here **

His resume communicates he is smart, organized and can do well in anything he chooses. However, his will get more interviews if he presents his experience in a linear story of progression toward the role he is trying to obtain. There are two parts to this advice. First, deciding what entry level role he will be happy with (not easy). There's a psychological and a strategic aspect. Second, tailoring the resume. 

For the first part, I'll repeat some of the suggestions I gave to my friend's cousin who recently graduated college and only has a vague idea that he wants to go into marketing. Most of it can probably applied to Royce's search. Finally, I'll say that as a new graduate it's easy to suffer from paralysis. That first job has been built up for so long that the expectations are tremendous. Especially for high-achievers, not only does the job description have to be perfect, but there's also lingering doubt about making the right career choice. My advice is to choose roles that offer long-term transferable experience and skill development even if the title, industry or job description isn't ideal. In the short-term, he may be interested in environmentally conscious businesses, but industry and tastes change 10 and 20 years out. In the long-term, top-notch skills in design, drafting, communication and engineering will always be in demand. Those were just a few examples, not knowing anything about his industry, but the strategy below will help him identify patterns or long-term qualities required for his line of work.

Along with quantifying your resume, make sure you're thinking about relevancy to the job title you're trying to get. Go on indeed.com and look at the requirements for jobs you'd like to have. You don't have to do it for every job application, but look at 10 to 20 and you'll notice patterns. Since you lack experience -- tailor your resume to show the potential employer that what you've done in the past has prepared you for what you want to do -- even if it's not direct experience. For example, searching for Marketing Analyst I found 

""Requirements: The Marketing Analyst is primarily responsible for the day to day coordination, supervision and management of all marketing efforts designed to acquire and retain Credit and Prepaid Cardholders. He or she implements front-end processes and supports end-to-end campaign management required to execute acquisition and retention marketing campaigns. The Marketing Analyst will develop, implement, analyze and report out on campaigns for in-branch, digital (online/mobile), email and other channels.""

So, the company is looking for someone to acquire and retain new customers. Have you done something similar as a tutor? Or business consultant? Perhaps you had to plan and execute ways to acquire and retain other tutors, students or business people. Your resume will seem cluttered or aimless (his words!) until you identify what company and position you're targeting. 

We didn't get a chance to talk about this over the phone, but I'll also point out that the resume is only a part of the job hunt. The saying goes, looking for a job is a full-time job. I don't know what your schedule is like, but I could easily spend 40-60 hours a week doing these tasks:

* Writing custom resumes and cover letters
* Making cold and warm phone calls to decision makers within companies
* Informational interviews (coffee &amp; lunch). Ask for further introductions. You don't need to ask for a job -- they'll know you're looking. You're expanding your network of people within the industry that are the first to know about internal openings.
* Reaching out to alumni (even from different schools).  
* Attend and volunteer for professional and company mixers (with people employed in your industry)
* Read continually improve your search &amp; interview strategy
* Follow-up phone calls and asking for introductions to friends of friends that are doing what you want to do.
* Applying for temp work that's relevant
* Keep a spreadsheet of all the companies and people you contact, notes and date of contact and mark your calendar to follow-up.

The Marketing Specialist requirements looks doable. Here's the next step. Go to indeed.com/salary and type in a couple titles you think you'd like and record all the equivalent titles. For example, http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Marketing+Specialist&amp;l1=&amp;tm=1  You just got 10 new job categories. Repeat the previous step for each title and you now have tens of new titles. Each one has several 1000 openings if you're willing to move (and at your age you should). Start a word document and keep a record of specific requirements, licenses, experiences or trade terms that keep reappearing for each title. For example, the Marketing Specialist listing you noted asks for...

""Develop tactical marketing plans for all business channels, including but not limited to trade shows, public relations, social media, press releases, product reviews, and product support to successfully promote our products and drive sales."" There are several ways you can act on these requirements. First, tailor your resume as much as you can to position yourself as someone capable of handling these requirements. Second, teach yourself and start doing these things for an internship, nonprofit or local marketing competition (I assume they have these in LA). Not only may you land a job or referral for doing good work, but also you now have relevant experience on your resume. 

""negotiating Coop, MDF, BER, SPA"" I have no idea what this means, but Google the terms and make sure you're at least aware of what they are. Copy and paste into your word doc, especially if you see these requirements appear again and again. You can either start teaching yourself online or through books or looking to get an entry position that will give you experience  with these tools. An advanced tip for career progression, if you keep up-to-date on the in-demand experience and skills for your career path you'll know what to target in your next job or internship. Rinse and repeat for every level until you become VP or get tired of corporate.  

People change jobs quite often and if he knows exactly the type of position he wants (and can't get) then it would be best to take something tangential and move in 1-2 years. Which seems like a long time when you're young!

As for tailoring his resume, I'll have to see the types of job descriptions he's going for to see if he's positioning himself well. From a hiring manager's perspective, if you don't fit the business needs it doesn't matter how smart or accomplished you are."

Is it possible my education is hurting me?,startingettingdpress,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2eef0a/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_is_it_possible_my/,"Quick background: Graduated from college in June, from a top 5 school in the country. Was very ill up until recently, so I started my job search a bit late, I admit. I have now been looking for 3 months.

I initially started looking into ""real jobs"", but I couldn't even get interviews for those, because a lot of them required that you have an internship in the field your junior year summer. I was in the hospital then, so I couldn't. I have year long internships in marketing/public relations though.

So then I started applying to marketing/public relations all over the country. Got ONE interview in state, ONE out of state. Didn't get either. Okay.

So, then, my money started running out. So I figured, I needed a part time job/full time temporary so I can put gas in my car. I started applying to administrative assistant jobs (have had one of these before one summer during undergrad), temp jobs, part-time internships, anything related to marketing/editing/public relations. Haven't heard back from any except one.

I was just told that I did not get the job for the 25 hour a week marketing internship, that you don't even need a degree for. In the interview, the guy kept commenting on how I went to a ""great school"".

I'm really at a loss for what to do here. I have no money, I have medical bills, and I can't even get a part time internship.

Should I apply to grocery stores next? I would, but I'm going to assume that they won't hire me, because I REALLY don't have any experience with that stuff.

I'm depressed and embarrassed and I kind of hate myself."

CS major from a B-league engineering school. Junior-year internship with a top-5, dismal: alone all the time, project doomed orphaned before starting (junior dev: ""yeah, sorry, we had no time for you guys""). Blossomed into a job offer, opted to switch into a division+product I felt passionate about. 

**Background, job**

Landed in the division but missed the product(s). Code is old and garbage. Documentation non-existent, tribal knowledge prevails. Manager is foreign -- aware and adult in communicating but not responsive to my concerns about long onboarding time, difficulty grasping codebase (""it's okay, take the time you need""). I still understand the purpose and function of project only in nebulous terms and it appears the team started much in the same way. Team is expected to interface with disparate types of internal users -- broad assumptions make for brittle code, CR and QA requirements seem to be formalities. Finishing third month.

**Problem**

Growing anxious, feeling as though the experience isn't valuable or contributing to my abilities as an SD. Going through the motions, feeling continually-more drained working for a team+project I do not identify with, do not understand, do not feel a genuine desire to help succeed. Would much prefer working a side-project, starting something on a rewrite or switching org/companies. Just moved to big metro area -- options exist.

Not eligible for internal transfer until one-year mark. Exceptions given by manager (and manager\^), but fearful that asking will bring more bad than good. Willing to forego bonus+relocation penalty for leaving early, but concerned lack of experience and indication of bad fit will affect prospects.

**Question**

What would you do in my position?"

4.) When it comes to honors and or awards does that only apply to Education/projects or does that include any honors outside of education. (Athletics,clubs)

5.) When it comes to applying for internships does the objective change?

Now a week an ago I got call for job interview I thought it was about Android development ((because that was the main focus of my CV and I spent last couple of days doing Android job interviews)).


The job was about ASP.net development, I was asked a couple questions regarding my previous project and my responsibilities at the internship back then.


I told the interviewer right out that was long time ago and I’m currently into android development regardless I was given a task with 3 days deadline.


I did the task as personal challenge and quick review in C# &amp; ASP.net, packaged in zip file and sent it to them and I didn't expect them to call back because I know I could have done 10x times better and all I did was drag &amp; drop webforms controls and type few code lines.


But apparently I passed, they liked what I did and according to the IT manager how I created the database and the relationships between the tables is great to real-world application.


Today I just finished the interview with the IT Manager and GM of the company, they talked how I would be the only developer in charge and develop CRM from scratch, the IT manager going to supplement me with database and stored procedures.


When I talked to the IT manager that senior developer is more suited, he said that the company has just merged and company in restructuring phase, senior developer want junior under him to do the heavy lifting code wise while senior guide him, so they are looking for motivated Junior and my GitHub projects (Android, with some ruby on rails and some python) shows that I can research and finish my tasks.


The IT manager took me aside and said I’m more likely to get the job.

Tomorrow they going to call me with their offer and I’m seriously confused as hell.


In one hand is great opportunity I’m going to build something from scratch and CRM no less and they plan to make me work in optimization and mobile friendly site, this is going to boost my resume ten folds and they told me in the future they going to hire another junior that is going to work under me.


In another hand I haven’t did this shit before and this is my second real job, I can already imagine myself stressed the fuck out and If I didn’t know how to do something there isn’t going to be senior to bail me the fuck out.


I haven’t heard about my other android development job interviews and my family want me to accept even if it crashed and burned this going to be great in my resume.


What Should I do?

I was homeschooled prior to attending college (it was a crippling and devastating experience) and as such I wasn't able to adjust socially for the first two years. The school itself is also sort of a refuge for students with low functioning to midrange Aspergers syndrome, so the social situation itself is incredibly frustrating. I'm trapped without any kind of support network, knowing that I'll be spending a long time trying to recover the skills needed to acculturate myself into mainstream society, network, and gain an advantage in job interviews.

My GPA is at 2.98 as a PoliSci major, due to my general directionlessness and immaturity freshman year, poor advising, and my shock regarding the school's climate, leading to severe depression. The head of my department informed me that PolSci doesn't have the course offerings required to matriculate into most graduate programs because of poor funding, and my own experience with an internship course was underwhelming - we're paying 30K per year and most internships people do in my department are for local politics/canvassing jobs! The only exceptions are for people who can afford to go abroad. If I had known this beforehand, I never would have declared.

I'm considering a switch to a mathematics major (which I was very good at back in high school, was a Mathlete...) because, let's face it, I'll be tending bar until a second-rate graduate program accepts me if I continue on the path I'm on. The 30K I'd be paying for my last semester is worth two years of in-state tuition when you factor in financial aid, so I'm strongly considering taking a semester off to work on my personal issues and then applying to the state school + aid while I'm still enrolled at my previous school's degree program (second BA means no aid). I don't think my school is worth the egregious amount of money any longer, but I'm looking at lost time. FYI I'm turning 24 in December, and I'm 30K in the hole.

I would like any advice you can offer me and please be candid.

I have a Bachelors of Science , Computer Science from an ABET accredited-institution. During my undergrad I interviewed for the few internships that were available but was never lucky enough to get a chance. I have been graduated for over 2 years  and at this point have yet to work.  I have been on several interviews and disgustingly have been told ,amongst other things,that:

""we would love to hire someone that speaks English but that is up to management""

from an interviewer who let me know his h1-b status at the beginning of an  interview:  ""there is no future for americans in tech because all the jobs can be sent away.""     

""we wish we could hire an american""


now i'm no bigot,seeing as I am a minority myself, and believe in meritocracy.i did not even know of the issues with h1-b and outsourcing well into my unemployment.

but at this point I am beginning to become extremely depressed. 
I have exhausted all my funds,I cannot receive financial aid for graduate school or another undergrad, I refuse to take out more loans,and I cannot borrow money from anyone for more schooling.

I am becoming suicidal. I could of majored in something such as Nursing or Teaching,but now I am trapped. I see no way out,the world is progressing, I have lost friends and even my long-term girlfriend due to my unemployment,and I do not even have the will to work on personal projects.

All I do is apply for jobs I find on boards and never hear back.


 I have true passion for computing but following this path has led me down the road to ruin and defeat. I pursue employment in other areas but I am told that either I am over or under-qualified.

Please provide me with guidance before it is too late. And please do not tell me to call a number. I have been there,I have been in a ward. But nothing can change the fact that people just will not hire me.

I am skilled,friendly,personable,intelligent, affable,good-looking,creative and all the things that make a person attractive. I can laugh at myself ,can be very modest,and I always try to find the bright side to a situation. But this is literally killing me.

I am not looking for a job-offer(that would be embarrsing considering you now know my darkest secret). I am not  looking for a critique of my resume. What I need is guidance on what I should do next. Should I maybe suck it up ,take out loans, and start a new career in maybe teaching or nursing, or should I keep plugging away, unemployed? I am in my early 30's .

My undergraduate degree is product design, and I'd ultimately like to combine the skills learned in undergrad and grad school to obtain a fulfilling career.  What can I do over the next two years while I work toward this degree?  My degree program has some specific paths that can lead to certificates, e.g. project management, information architecture.  Should I be searching for an entry level IT job to work while I'm in school?  Should good internships be my focus?  I ultimately want a career in IT management, user experience, usability, or app/web development.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much."
2ehwwl,1,2014-08-24,My career and what I can expect in the future [Questions at the end],[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2ehwwl/my_career_and_what_i_can_expect_in_the_future/,"Warning: Extremely long. Most everything but the last few paragraphs is just background and unimportant to be honest. I tried to make it slightly entertaining though.

This may be an odd post for this sub. I don't lurk new and make sure this sort of thing doesn't get asked and downvoted all the time. I have been lurking around posts for a couple months now and everyone here seems like a pretty good person. This is my last night before classes so I'm just sitting here doing a lot of thinking.

Preamble: I'd honestly like to be the total sysadmin that has his fingers in everything. Networking, servers, keeps track of help desk, etc. I honestly enjoy the feeling of knowing what is going on everywhere. Also to note, throughout this post I will mention things that I would never say in an interview. You still won't hear the stories that are protected by NDA though :)

First, I'd like to give a short background on my experience with IT work so far. 

From a very young age I've known computers were my thing and where I wanted to go. I liked to tinker with them growing up, and my dad would tell me stories of the systems he has set up in the past. I've always loved working with computers.

My high school had a Cisco lab, and I had all four CCNA classes done before I received a high school diploma. I then went to a local college where I did CCNP Routing and switching, but not troubleshooting. I did fairly well in the classes, but never took the tests. Now I'm rather rusty on networking and would need quite a bit of re-training. I've considered spending a summer redoing a lot of networking training, but it's horrible boring to read about. 

In my community college I had some formal exposure to Linux, and received my A+ certification, as well as spent some time learning about and playing with ESXi and Centrix Xen server. I also spent some time working on the help desk for minimum wage. It was pure T1 support. Fix the simple things like an incorrect account flag, reset passwords, fix student computers for no charge (but occasionally a pizza). After my internship finished, I was asked to come back and help the next semesters interns. This happened twice more, and I ended up working there for a year and a half. I learned a lot there, but obviously from a very limited perspective. 

After I received my associates, I was almost immediately offered a position as an internal help desk guy for one of the largest companies in town. This being small town Kansas, isn't much. Three man IT team managing 300 local computers and another 100 at two locations in other states. This department had been set up amazingly... seven years before. No documentation had been written since, and everything set up since then was wrong in some way. Servers running on random desktops in the work room despite having three ESXI hosts, web server had no Windows updates for two years and had 2GB of ram allocated for 28 websites and subdomains. Exchange server only had a single partition for OS and Exchange and all of it's logs and data files. No windows updates, period, on any workstations or servers per CTO's orders. We ignored that one a lot. To top it off, they had purchased an Appassure backup solution several months before and it wasn't working. A month after I started the CTO fired the network admin for doing an internal security audit (He was ""overstepping his bounds"" by asking why credit cards were stored in plain text. I could tell you stories about our CTO for hours). I had full admin access, with the only exception being the Domain admin account that ran services. There was my boss, IT man of 13 years for the company and myself there. He was not comfortable with servers or networks. He was a beast fixing computers out on the plant floor though. Anyways, I was basically asked to fix servers and switch configs despite very clear warnings from the CTO that I was to never touch any of that. We ended up going almost two months without an actual server admin, and there were a few fires. During the last three weeks of it my boss was traveling and I was the guy to fix everything. They finally hired a new server administrator, and I trained him on our environment. His first name was Darth, I shit you not. It was rather entertaining. He quit three months later and gave me his contact information. Told me if I needed a job he would pull every string he had to get me one. Another month later we got another server admin. Nice guy, will work great in that environment. I mean no disrespect to him, but if he was told to ignore something that was literally on fire and to work on managing the e-mail filter instead he would do it. I worked there a year left as the third longest running member of the IT+web+programming departments. Excluding the CTO there were two of the original 12 that were there when I started. I had decided to go back to university for various reasons which included being called into the CTO's office and being told he was being generous for my $0.25 raise. 

I was quickly accepted to a few universities, but K-state was the only one in my budget. I decided to dual major Information systems and Management of Information Systems. After the first semester and a single computer class I was asked to come and help teach a ""Basics of Sever Administration"" class the next semester (the one starting tomorrow). The semester was quite boring. I realized too late that MIS classes were the same as General business classes with the exception of two basic computer classes that taught things such as Access and what wi-fi was. 

During this summer I got with Darth and started a new intern position at a IT department for a manufacturing company that had recently gone international. Since Darth had started working there they had totally redone the server room, half the servers, and just massive replacements of things that were done wrong when he and his friend started working there. I was asked to come in two days before the full time help desk guy. After my two days there I was asked to train and evaluate the new guy, as he had no formal training.. I did what I could, and we spent the next month working and learning the new environment together as I just silently watched the small things about how he worked and offered suggestions when I could. I also paid attention to what was happening at the server admin level. Just listened to them troubleshoot things and learned how some various things worked. I got to use my networking training to troubleshoot a couple issues for one of the engineers too! Was very rusty on it and it took me way longer to solve the problems than it should have though.

Moving on to this next year, I've all but dropped the MIS degree and am going to focus exclusively on Information Systems classes. The class I'm helping teach I haven't taken before, but that shouldn't slow me down at all. I've been using Linux as a primary operating system for the past year, but Linux server management is still totally outside my current knowledge, and I haven't found a way to really work on it short of setting up and running some servers myself. Networking I can practice in Packet Tracer, and I've found some good labs that I can try (thanks to this sub). I'm delving a bit more into programming in my classes this semester as well.

So we finally get to my questions. 

Is there any specific things I can do just to 'brag' about them in an interview? I know my previous jobs are not the best at showing how I understood what was wrong and needed to happen, and explaining that toes the line of talking bad about previous employers.

I'm two for three in environments that needed to be totally replaced. Reading around this sub, it seems to be a pretty common thing outside of massive companies. Can I expect this moving forward? 

K-state is a popular university, and the career fairs here are going to be awesome opportunities for me to search for internships and jobs, as well as just plain networking. I have pretty bad social anxiety however, and it can be tough for me to approach someone and ask them to do something for me (offer internship). Does anyone have tips how I could instead talk to them very briefly to make them want to give me a chance instead?

What are some things that you think I could work on to be more valuable in an IT team?

Is my experience actually as noteworthy as I hope, or do I really need to step it up to move into any type of position with responsibility? Three years of general work, three years of IT work (admittedly mostly help desk stuff), an associates degree with six semesters of networking training at 21 years old.

General tips and advice!

I apologize for any mistakes. Something has come up and I don't have as much time to proofread as I would like."

I live in Brazil (will buy in the US), so really need advice",Rakshaer,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2eiw6x/build_help_need_help_i_live_in_brazil_will_buy_in/,"Hi, I'm reposting because the one yesterday got no response, hope that is ok

OK, here is the deal. I live in Brazil and the taxes and rates here are simply amazing. If I buy a used r9 290, for example, it will be at least twice as expensive as a new one on amazon USA.
I've been gaming on xbox for the last few years, and honestly I miss PC gaming and really want to find my way back. What I want to try, then, is to have a family member bring the parts when they visit the US next month. It might take two trips though (maybe another family member is going on business by the end of this year), because tax law allows for $500 of merchandise purchased outside the country to enter by plane with a passenger. What I want to do, then, is to order everything I can online. I also want to give priority to whatever can travel safely and whatever will have the biggest price/weight ratio. Probably going to try to find the case here, for example.

I haven't had a PC in ages, and really miss playing games on PC. Just trying to find my way back to Zion, I guess. Trying to find an internship now (engineering student), and will probably have to buy parts in a complicated market, so the budget is real.. Don't think I can go over $800, especially without the case, PSU, monitor, peripherals, etc... Still have to buy those.

By the way, are monitors safe to bring in luggage? Or are they too sensitive? Really would like to bring it from there, if at all possible. Might not be, though, and it will murder my wallet and all its children if I'm forced to buy it here.

Those are my main questions, anyway. Would love some advice on what to do, what to order there and what to try and get here. What would be safe to buy used would be nice, since I don't really know what sources to trust.

The build I'm leaning towards is this one:

I know the processor is not that seen on /r/buildapc, so I've been wondering about it. I think I like the 280x there, since when I need an upgrade I can get another one and just use both (if the motherboard allows it). I'll probably need a bigger PSU to be able to handle that future upgrade, then, right? Or should I get a decent enough PSU and just upgrade when I upgrade the GPU?

1440p sounds awesome if I can get there, but if I buy the monitor in Brazil, it'll probably be way above my budget. The monitor alone would cost more than the entire build (wish to God I was joking. Just checked, the cheapest I found was over US$1000).

Anyway, as you can see, I really need help. Any advice is welcome. =)"

So in summary, it is like this.

The company I am at trains people to become Agile, as in becoming Agile methodology practitioners like Scrum Master, Product Owner, etc.

They are small and growing. They have some data in a google excel sheet that is being shared across to the key individuals in the company who needs them.

1) The company has data on Agile course offerings Instructor name, cost etc.

2) The company uses RegOnline to register their course offerings and then those course details like date, cost, instructor gets updated on the company site.

3) Then, the company must also register those course offerings to ScrumAlliance.org website as well, which means the same information that was in the companies google excel sheet (1) , must be in RegOnline, and then on ScrumAlliance website as well.

4) The last part is QA to make sure the information is the same across ALL 3 platforms (or whatever the proper term is here). IN other words, the data that was in the Google Excel sheet must be present and be the same in the companies website, then ScrumAlliance.org's website as well.

The part I need to do as an intern is to figure out how to automate the verification part once everything is registered in all 3 parts of the website. 

5) How to make that happen? Where do I start?

I was thinking Google Scripts, which should be able to directly read from Google Sheets, then somehow those google scripts needs to go to another website, perform a search and find the course information and then verify it to make sure all data is accurate.

How/What is the best way to make this happen?

Please help.

Thank You"

I'm currently entering my senior year of CS in Michigan. I've been very active in getting a few internships that are local, which kept me coding and added to my professional development skills. I'm also doing very well in school with a small set of minor side projects (busy with internships and classes mostly). I graduated with honors (3.8 GPA) from my community college in CS, before I transferred to a regional university that is also close to home. I'm currently not with the honors college, but I also have a good GPA (3.7) there too. 

I'm feeling a little depressed and overwhelmed going into this year. My dream is to move out of state to join a large tech company as a software engineer / developer. I've made numerous attempts to get internships to Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. They have all ended with silence or a ""maybe next time"" email. With some suggestions from various posts on here I have updated my resume over time. I think it was helpful getting some local attention (the very few positions around my city anyway). I'm not sure how to go about trying to apply to more distant jobs. I don't have any connections at these companies, most of my classmates don't have ambitions to move and so they are all generally local after graduation, and my area has very little to no large scale tech companies / branches. The nearest major city would be Chicago. 

I guess my question is this: I feel I can compete and ultimately be successful in these companies but I'm lost as to where to go to let them know I exist. My university does not have a direct recruiter that finds people like U of M or similar universities have available. I'm worried that because I chose a medium, but not a super large public university farther away that my options are more limited. Any advice? "
2ejyoj,1,2014-08-25,[Build Ready] Gaming/Workstation: Blu (20750 DKK / $3674),[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2ejyoj/build_ready_gamingworkstation_blu_20750_dkk_3674/,"Hello /r/buildapc!

After months of saving up and lurking around I am slowly getting ready to get my parts. I am intending to get the parts through the course of this week, or next week at the latest.

This build is going to be my main development station and is also going to serve as my first real gaming rig. As I have been moving from country to country quite a lot in the last period I never afforded to build a desktop so as a result I have missed pretty much every game in the last 6 years, so I have a lot of catching up to do, and since I was lucky enough to land a decent internship, I decided to not make any compromises when it came to paying extra for playing all the AAAs at ultra settings.

Another thing to notice is that I listen to a lot of music, especially metal, and I wanted to finally invest in quality equipment to go with my music library.

I am going to get all the parts from Denmark, except for the keyboard which is not available in any store there. You can use [edbpriser](http://www.edbpriser.dk/) for computer parts and [hifipriser](http://www.hifipriser.dk/) for audio equipment if you would like to suggest any changes.

Some things I would like some advice on:

* Will I have any issues overclocking in the H440? I love the looks of it, and even though I read some threads around here, I still feel like it is a bit air starved. Has anyone had any experience in overclocking with AIOs in the HH40?
* The VRM on the Extreme4 seems quite tall and placed right at the top, will I have any issues with mouting the radiator because of it?
* Since the X61 is relatively new, should I not risk it and go with the X60? I mostly got it for the variable pump speed. I don't mind the noise while gaming but when I'll use my desktop for development I would like it to be as quiet as possible.
* Is the Essence STX good enough to drive the 250 Ohm Beyerdynamics? I chose to go with this combo because it was much cheaper than any decent DAC + Amp combo that I could find in Denmark. I read the mobo has pretty good onboard audio would it be better to dowgrade to the 80 Ohm version of the DT 770 and go with the integrated audio?

Note: I am well aware that this is crazily overpriced compared to the US, but this were the cheapest prices I could find in Denmark at the moment for these parts, so yeah, nothing I can do about that.

^(And yes, I did try to go for a black/blue theme)

This is going to be long, and I apologize ahead of time, but I'm very frustrated.

I have a bachelor's in Construction Management and am currently getting my MBA (I'll graduate in 2 years).  During my undergrad I got an internship with a really great engineering firm in the midwest.  I was hoping to do residential construction and maybe build custom homes, but when the market hit in 2008 there was really nothing available.  So I got this internship, which then turned into a full time career doing civil construction.  I started off doing inspection work but have mainly been doing more project management and supervising.  I don't really like the work a lot because I see myself as more of an office type, but I have a ton of freedom and I'm able to pay the bills.  I've been with the company for a little over 5 years now.  I consider myself a model employee.  My reviews have always been great, I've never gotten in trouble.  I've always received my annual 2-3% raise, always received a bonus, and I am told I one of the top 3 employees within my area.

I like the company a lot, but I'm looking for something that provides more opportunity, more responsibility, the ability to take advantage of my MBA, and of course, a lot more pay.  I see myself as a VP, CEO, or doing something that is going to earn me well into the 6 figures.  I've learned in my field, that unless you have your PE, you really can't go anywhere up from where I am or at the very least, it is INCREDIBLY hard.  So I think it could be very beneficial to go into the business side of things.  Our company is growing extensively and at our last company briefing our President said, ""If you're someone who wants to move up and is ready for something big, then say something"".  I did just that and had a couple talks with our VP of Business Development.  I've been told I would be a great addition and I most definitely have the personality and drive to be successful.  I've attended a dinner and read a book he's given me, but aside from that, it's been very generic and no specific plans have been made to develop me into a new role (despite me asking several times).

I recently found out that I am *severely* underpaid.  I know I was brought in during a big recession, but man...I had no idea.  I'm paid hourly, so my base pay is low and I have the opportunity to make time and a half with overtime.  I have a coworker who works for a different firm, but his firm doesn't have near the market share my company does.  We win a ton of more work than his company does.  I make approximately $45k a year before overtime and my company will end up paying $4,500 of my $17,000 MBA.  He is younger than me, with no degree, and he is making $12,000 more a year (before OT), has a company truck, and if he wanted his MBA the company would pay 100% of it.  For the record, last year I had about $16,000 in overtime, but due to the project I'm on right now, I'm expecting to get not even 1/4 of that.

This is the first year that I've worked very closely with not only my own employees, but other competitors and my client.  I've seen everyone's quality and mine is by far the best.  My competitors have noticed it and shown interest in hiring me, my client has noticed by doing the same, and also extending my time here -- I was originally only guaranteed to be here for 6 months and I'm going on 3 years.  I brought this up in my review (not the portion about finding out about the other guy's pay, I hadn't found out yet) and that I feel I deserve a lot more money.  I told them that while I had a DRASTIC increase in overtime last year and made more money that year than I ever had before, we all know that is not guaranteed and if the only thing I have promised to me is my base pay, I think paying one of your best employees $45K a year is entirely too low.  I asked for a 33% raise increasing me to $60K a year.  My bosses stated that where I want to be, taking advantage of my degrees, and eventually how much money I want to make...they can't do anything about it, but I should stick close to my VP of BD because he can.  **However,** after saying this, he did say, ""We can't pay you what you're eventually wanting to get to...now the $60K, we can do that...but not what you're eventually going to want to be at.""  At this point, I'm thinking sweet...I'll grab this nice raise, then I'll focus more on the BD stuff.  Keep in mind we are experiencing rapid growth and expect to double in size, locations, revenue, etc. within 10 years.  I was so happy.

I got my raise today and it was 5%.  I've talked with another employee that works with my company before the raise came and I told him we would see if whatever they gave me was enough to keep me around.  The conversation went like this:

""Well, I'm sure you're making at least $25/hour""

""Nope""

""Well, I'll bet you're making $50,000 before OT""

""Nope""

""Oh.""

Suspicion confirmed.  I plan on calling my boss tomorrow to ask for feedback on how he came back with his number.  How did you feel that was justified?  What did you use to determine whether or not a $1.20/hour raise was sufficient?  Why is my raise so incredibly far from the number we talked about; the number you said you could do?

I know I could get hired on with other companies, but I've been told that I would really be doing the same thing I'm doing now forever, which I can't stand.  So it seems like I could go to another company and make a good amount of more money, but do nothing professionally, or I could sit where I'm at, and MAYBE get bumped into something great, but make terrible pay in the meantime.

Thanks for making it this far and any help or insight you have for me would be greatly beneficial!"

I just started my first basic web design and some coding internship and I have this challenge ahead of me. I need to automate a task that is manually done using some kinds of scripting and/or automation testing tools.

First, the company is small and growing fast (Startup, around 50-100 ppl). They offer training in Agile development methodologies. They have courses that they regularly offer and need to be put on their website and 1 other outside website so that the course details like date/cost/instructor/location are all the same across all systems.

Here are the rough steps of what they do:

1) The company has data on Agile course offerings Instructor name, cost etc. in a Google Sheet document that is shared between all employees and its updated whenever new course offerings are scheduled.

2) The company uses RegOnline to register their course offerings and then those course details like date, cost, instructor gets updated on the company's WordPress based website automatically. So this part is, have google sheet open, login to RegOnline, then fill a form with the info for the course, 

3) Then, the company must also register those course offerings to ScrumAlliance.org website as well, which means the same information that was in the companies google excel sheet (1) , must be in RegOnline, and then on ScrumAlliance website as well.

4) The last part is QA to make sure the information is the same across ALL 3 platforms (or whatever the proper term is here). IN other words, the data that was in the Google Excel sheet must be present and be the same in the companies website, then ScrumAlliance.org's website as well.

The part I need to do as an intern is to figure out how to automate the verification part once everything is registered in all 3 parts of the website.

5) How to make that happen? Where do I start?

I was thinking Google Scripts, which should be able to directly read from Google Sheets, then somehow those google scripts needs to go to another website, perform a search and find the course information and then verify it to make sure all data is accurate.

How/What is the best way to make this happen?

Please help.

Thank You"

I'm a science grad who is looking to make a career change into web development (mainly because of job prospects but also because of work culture). I taught myself HTML/CSS when I was a kid and did some freelancing later in college, but never really kept up with new developments and whatnot. I know my way around Wordpress pretty well and can hack together a plugin or solution, but have never really developed anything on my own. My Javascript is weak (working on it), PHP is decent enough, and Python skills are okay but moreso in bioinformatics. I've used Github maybe once. My portfolio has some more complex stuff like eCommerce and WP multisite, but I still feel like I'm missing something. I've never worked on a larger project, felt like I've created something that I could actually call my own (mainly use frameworks/templates), or worked on a team where I can learn from others.

I was offered an internship and it's not enough to pay my loans/rent/bills. I can take this and supplement my income with freelancing (currently doing all freelance and it sucks), but I'm wondering if I have enough experience and skill set to try my hand as a junior web developer instead. I'd also like to move more into back-end, which I'm pretty clueless about. Based on the info above, would I be competitive enough to be a FT junior/entry level web dev?

So at this point, with more expendable $$ and a bit more time, I would like to either upgrade what I have or build something new.  The only change I have made to the stock Asus is a PCI express card so I can run dual 23"" monitors.

I'm taking five years at my university because my academics aren't that great and because of a recent injury. I'm also in the easiest major at my school. I'm supposed to be in a very happy town but I just feel depressed everyday. It is overwhelming and I can't for see myself being okay anytime soon let alone anytime at all. I've always been Melancholy but never as I like to put it ""chronically"" or ""terminally depressed."" I've never had it easy, I've had it that hard but still I was constantly bullied and my father walked out and died, so my childhood wasn't stellar. But still these last four years are supposed to be my best but have been my worst, some parts are my fault others are not. I'm also ""accident prone"" I've broken 17 bones, gone into anaphylactic shock 5 times, tore an internal organ, plenty of sports injuries, concussions and I've had over 20 stitches, none of these happened in once. None of these hurt like the last injury, 60 weeks ago I was working at a camp as head back-packing guide, I was pressured into working at because I was the only man who could do the job and my mom wanted me out of the home, I wanted to focus on my acting/filmmaking career (I know). I was on the job doing something that was out of my area but still, I was pushed my a co-worker, somebody who worked under me and I broke my spine and nearly died and almost lost control from the waist down.

 Nothing hurts more in the world than this injury and has become the bane of my existence. I have numbness in my left leg and severe pain constantly, I cant sleep, I can't wake up, I can't work out, I can barely walk, I can't ride my bike, I can't do anything and the medication I was taking makes me feel like puking daily, I've lost 20 pounds since the injury. I was planning on becoming a firefighter but it doesn't seem like I'm getting better. My doctor the, workers comp guy is a piece of crap and is not giving me the treatment I need, I took the summer off just to heal and I've only gotten worse, not by doing anything, it is just degenerating.  3 months and nothing has been done, besides ""waiting"" for treatment, I was prescribed meds that make me feel like hell but work a little bit, but still I am getting worse. I feel like the guy is running a scam, but I digress, I was hurt on the job from somebody else, it wasn't my fault at all I'm paying the price. The worst part is the guy who hurt me got my job and the best Summer of his life, he also pissed on my gear the day before and hit me when people weren't watching, but I could not fire him because we were short on staff... Shouldn't the main priority be to get my healthy? I want to work! I want to work right now, anything to get me out of this hell and out of pain. All of my friends have graduated and are working internships my roomie from freshmen year is now getting paid $40/hr and president of a Frat. I'm nothing... I wanted to get healthy before the school year, but the reverse has happened. 

Never had a girlfriend, I belong to no clubs and nobody would want to take me. I'm just a loser borrowing money from my crazy mother to pay rent because I make no money, I'm ashamed to say I live off the gov't. I want to a be productive, I don't want to play video games all day, even when I was healthy I didn't play video games. I used to run 4 miles a day when I get upset, nothing good is happening now. All my clubs, acitivites and coping-mechanisms have been taken away from me. All of this would be better if I showed signs of improvement, or if I felt the healthcare system cared about me, I've considered just taking out a loan and seeing a private doc, but we're broke. My mom is disabled and crazy, this past year she lost my childhood home to the bank, shit sucks.

I don't have many friends and since my injury I've been more and more depressed and my friends want to spend less time with me, I have a vacation home that my grandpa owns, I can't even get people to go up there with me. I feel like suicide is not only my only option but my best option, I feel selfish for living, every breath I take is one taken away from somebody else. My old-landlord stole a lot of my stuff and money. I've been in love with a girl, she is the only girl for me and I've loved her for two years, she is fucking some dude because I just didn't have the confidence to ask her out.... I came back from the vacation home a week early because I read the date of a docs appointment as the 22nd instead of the 27th. I'm an idiot, I have a broken body and a loser soul. I want to die before the semester starts and I make more people sad by my death. I just feel so sad every day and I'm just in such constant pain.... I wish I could have a job just to feel productive, I tried volunteering just as a resume booster but my pain was too much.

I'm a really cautious guy, i always watch porn on private mode, i've never been caught since i was 15 ( last time my dad found a stach of playboy under my bed, well i was young and stupid ).
For some reason i went to my favorite porn site ( xhamster , remember the name as it is important for the next part of the story ) on normal mode a few month back, without even noticing it. As you can imagine, i didn't visit just the front page, and i ended up with dozens of filthy video in my history ( yes i like to watch a TONE of video in a single jerking session ).

I was doing an internship in programming this summer and had to use my own computer. I work in embedded programming so i'm dealing with memory address quite often. This part is important because an address always starts with 0x since its in hexadecimal.
So here i am one day at work, i was stuck on a problem for quite some time and i thought i should ask my supervisor for help.

He comes over to my desk, we talk about the problem, he tries to find a solution but get stuck just like i did. Then he decides to ask a colleague for help, same result, no solution. Then the CTO ( i work for a start up with 9 employees,  so the CTO coming to help is not a big deal ) comes over. 
He ask me to look up a memory address on google so i proceed to type the address in the address bar. But for some reason i skipped the 0 of 0x and directly typed x. 
I watched in horror as a dozen xhamster pages comes up in the list retrieved from the history. Then i thought to myself, if im quick enough and press back space they will not notice it. 
Well sometimes being quick doesn't mean being dexterous, and instead of pressing back space, my brain decided to press enter...

And here i was, the front page of xhamster loaded in my browser, with my internship supervisor, another IT guy and the CTO of the startup focused on my computer screen. 
I closed the browser quickly, the page must have been on screen for less than 2 seconds, but i felt WAY longer. Needless to say i was red from embarrassment and started stammering something like &gt; Uhh sorry.. i don't what happened. I'm trully sorry ...&gt; 
I opened a new chrome page and typed in the search i was supposed to do. In the mean time, my supervisor and his colleague were laughing their ass off, the CTO had gone back to his office.
We never talked about the incident again, i've cleared my history and i make sure i'm ALWAYS in incognito mode now :)

Most of the time everybody just sit in front of the computer for hours, and when it comes to lunch time, most of them would just go off into their own little groups. I am usually the last one to grab lunch, mostly hoping that one of them might invite me to come along. 

I understand I am just an intern for 2 months and probably nobody would really care. But I do want to make a good impression. I struggle to come up with things to say to them other than work related stuff. This situation is making me a bit uncomfortable and little paranoid because I am not sure if I have done something wrong.

I mean I could say ‘f**k it’ and just stare at the screen and browse internet all day. But I know this situation might occur again in the future when I enter another new workplace, so I was wondering how do people generally be more active and sociable in a workplace? Any tips and advice would be great :)"
2eociz,0,2014-08-26,The Levaté Wheelchair Lift!,acstewart2010,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2eociz/the_levaté_wheelchair_lift/,"Hello!

Survey Questions:

1. The Levaté Wheelchair Lift restores independence and gives manual wheelchair users an extra 12 inches of reach. Wheelchair users face reach-related difficulties on a daily basis. The Levaté Wheelchair Lift gives manual wheelchair users an extra 12 inches of reach - in the grocery store, in the office, or at home. The lift is portable, weighs ten pounds, and can be attached in a matter of seconds - when you get in and out of your car, for example. Otherwise it clasps firmly and unobtrusively underneath your chair while you do the things you want to do. It is an alternative to the expensive retrofits that wheelchair users commonly choose to implement in their own homes.


2. At first, the team was working for an organization known as the Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth at the University of Oklahoma as interns for the inaugural Agile Product Design program. We saw a need for wheelchair users and attempted to come up with a solution. Now we are looking to make our innovative design come to life to give wheelchair users a sense of independence that they themselves  have said they desire. 


3. The team has been working on the start-up for about four months in Norman, Oklahoma!

4. 6 Month Plan: writing grants and finalizing the design of our product. We will also be conducting clinical trials with 10 prototypes with the help of doctors and other contacts. Filling the necessary paperwork the FDA as our product is a Class 2 item.  

1 year plan: We would like to be in the stages of production and selling the lift to users through wheelchair dealers and online sales.  Building up our team to market the product!  

5 year plan: Levaté is project to be sold to 19K customers in the next five years. We would like to make our design better and already have ideas for the next iteration of the wheelchair lift. Also, several independent ideas have been considered and we would like to solidify Levaté as a brand for wheelchair accessories.   

5. We have had both positive and negative experiences so far, however, the positive by far outweighs the bad.  The most rewarding part of this journey has been seeing how excited wheelchair users are when we interviewed them and asked them if the product would truly fulfill their needs. The support has been overwhelming and we are so grateful for their encouragement! The negative experience only deals with complications that arose in our design, however, many of the issues have been thought through and are being taken care of I write this.  

6.  If I could travel back in time I would tell myself to begin working on this project sooner! I have truly seen an incredible amount of personal growth from all the experiences I have had and am quite proud of what the team has accomplished so far.

I'm a CS major who has never really looked into the product side of things, never really thought in depth about products. Of course i'm familiar with Google and a lot of the notable stuff they do, but I don't really follow companies. Recently, the PM side of tech has started to look a lot more attractive to me than coding. And to be honest I'm just an ok programmer--I mean I've only been at it for 3 semesters. I've never done side projects. I haven't taken an Algorithms class or made my way through Cracking the Coding Interview. I'm not saying I wouldn't have anything to contribute at Google, I'm pretty creative and fairly smart. But I feel like you have to be exceptional to work at Google and I just can't see myself impressing anyone who interviews me. This impending interview terrifies me because I just don't have that much to talk about, and I could easily respond to any creative questions they ask me with long, painful pauses. Should I just resign myself to the fact that not everyone is capable of attaining their dream job, when the dream is to work at Google? Product is really interesting to me--I have been thinking about it a lot this past month--but I don't have anything to back this up with. Is it even worth it to interview?"

Keeping it short and sweet. I'm currently an upcoming junior computer engineer and mathematics major. I just recently somehow by the grace of sheer luck got a Co op with the company of my dreams, basically. However, a friend referred me to someone that he knows, and the owner of the company (I say owner, but it's a small business, it seems) just connected with me on LinkedIn and told me about a potential Android Dev position in the city that I live. I'm most comfortable programming on android (my summer internship was spent completely on this). The position is up to ""$125,000 salary plus stock and full benefits."" Surely, I won't expect 125k. But I do know a friend who was in a sub-par academic standing (I.e. our gpa's aren't great) like me, who got offered a full time position as a junior in college for 100k.

I'm a 20 year old college student. This is absolutely nuts and all new to me. My parents are against this since it would basically entail me dropping out of school, but I figured you guys would be more help.

I emailed the guy back and told him I am interested, and he wants to see my resume. He added me on LinkedIn, so he should obviously know that I'm still a student, where I work, etc.

Oh yeah!! Best part: I can work at home.

So... what should my game plan be here?"

My personal portfolio is a bit bare and my grades are decent/average (3.1 overall, 3.5 major). 

I had always intended to go into software development when I graduated, but the internship offer I was extended and accepted was in security consulting.  The internship will probably turn into a full time offer when I graduate, but it will likely only be a 2-3 year stint as their turnover is pretty high.

If I do accept a full-time offer will this lower my chances of being hired as a software engineer in the future (2 years)?

2epciv,0,2014-08-27,Non-STEM major trying to make it in Software Development,huskiesarecool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2epciv/nonstem_major_trying_to_make_it_in_software/,"Hey everyone,

I'm about to be a senior at the University of Washington this year. I'm an Economics major, but in this past year I made the decision to pursue software development. The reason why I'm not doing CS is because I didn't discover programming until my sophomore year and by then, it was already kind of late to pursue a CS degree.

I know there are people who made it in the SD industry without tech degrees, or even a college degree at all. But I am posting on here, because I wanted to gain some insight about what things I should be thinking of, given my experiences.

My classes so far: 2 intro CS classes covering data structures in Java, web programming, databases (SQL). By June 2015 (my expected graduation date), I'll have also completed: data structures &amp; algorithms, artificial intelligence, algorithms &amp; their complexity, programming concepts &amp; tools, high performance scientific computing, maybe a CS human comp-interaction class and another web dev class. I think I want to go into front-end. In the last few months, I've set up a GitHub, thrown a couple projects on there, and set up a portfolio website for employers to see my projects.

^ Those are just to give you guys an idea of what I'll have under my belt prior to graduation. UW has a very reputable CS program and I'm fortunate to be taking classes from it, but I of course am not going to graduate with a CS degree, but a background in one. I've been applying to internships, and will hopefully get one for some time during the school year. I also am considering delaying my graduation from June 2015 to December 2015, so that I will have that summer in between to do more internship stuff so that when I get thrown into the job market I'll have more experience... I'm just a bit nervous because I know that I'll be competing against CS/CSE majors when applying to full-time jobs post graduation, and I'll just have a social science degree... Anyway, any insight is welcome. Such as career steps/classes to take/ANYTHING. Thanks in advance!!

I'm a rising Junior Civil Engineer, interested in Structural Analysis. I also am studying Computer Science, interested in and have work experience in Web Development.

I go to school in New England and have lived here my whole life. I, like many others, am not a fan of New England weather and think I'd like to spend my adult life somewhere else. That being said, my family has done very little traveling that couldn't be done by car, so while a number of areas sound great in my head I haven't spent more than a week in any of them. Of the places I've been to, Seattle and San Diego have been great, and of the places I haven't, I'm really intrigued by the Bay Area. West Coast is not a requirement though.

My current thought process is it would be great to get an internship next summer in one of those places as a way of finding out if I actually would enjoy living there for an extended period of time while working. Quality of internship is still most important to me, so I don't plan on moving for a summer if it would require doing something irrelevant to my academic/career interests.

This is a very broad question, so any wisdom you can impart on me is welcome, even if it doesn't specifically fit my situation. Advice about seeking out internships that aren't local (besides the obvious ""network, bro""), seeking out living spaces, getting acclimated to both a new job and a new place at the same time, and things to keep in mind while doing all the above would be amazing. Anecdotes about similar experiences would also be great, as well as things I should make sure to bring/do/see if I end up in any of the aforementioned places.

I know this is very early to start thinking about next summer, but I'm hoping to catch some of you while you are still in the situation I hope to find myself in next summer. That way it will all still be fresh to you, and therefore will be clearer to me.

Thank you in advance."

Now I'm back in college, studying a mixture of computer science and business administration at the end of which I will have a B.B.A., the course also offers some specializations (programming, networking, web development, entrepreneurship) and I was thinking of going the entrepreneurship route next year. Still, I believe the research into genetics and molecular biology is the most important societal project since the internet and I want to be part of it.


I've been pondering the possibility of continuing on after these studies to a masters in bioinformatics, but does anyone know about what kind of work or internship could I do during my B.B.A. studies or after them, in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical sector?  
What is the job market like, especially in Europe?  
Any other advice?

I'm confident about doing the development. However, I just know there are things I am not doing on the business side of things.

I'm a student studying computer science, and while my school doesn't offer much web development I have learned a lot on my own. When internship time came around I was not surprised that ninety percent of them were web focused. I picked an internship with a guy who makes a lot of small business sites. I learned a ton and now that its winding down, he is going to pass some clients he doesn't have time for on to me.

The site is a pretty basic site. Its a medium sized business with locations in two cities. My boss at the internship quoted them $2500 (his usual fee for site development) and he recommended me and I have agreed to do the site for $1200. This includes the design and development, and I will be hosting it on my own with a few other sites I have made (this is my first paid gig, except for one other application I made for my school).


**So here are some quick questions:**

* Was $1200 a reasonable figure for site development?
* I agreed that they would pay me when the site was completed, was this a bad idea?
* Is there paperwork I should create? Contracts? Do I need to declare myself a business? 
* General advice on dealing with clients?
* What kind of stuff do you guys do to make clients feel like they are getting what they paid for?

There are so many resources out there on making the site, what kind of information can we share about making a business?

**EDIT**: Lots of comments about hosting, to be clear I was planning on hosting through DigitalOcean not physically doing hosting myself"

Before I order a barcode printer/scanner, I would like to know how simple of a task this is to fulfill. 

I personally have no idea how scanners work. Can you set a scanner to input information into excel for you? For example, if I have a group of 20 kegs that are all going to X Distributor today, can I set the scanner to ""today's date"" and ""X Distributor"" and simply scan all 20 kegs to have them put into the excel spreadsheet? Or would I have to scan each individually and input the information myself?

[Are you at all optimistic for the shooting and protests to lead to a shift in the severity of or awareness of prejudice black people in America face?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1y8cl?context=5)|Experts I have talked to believe that Ferguson will lead to some sort of shift in the awareness of prejudice and of questionable policing tactics. In the last two weeks, conversations about race, policing, profiling, and the militarization of local police departments have dominated society. It remains to be seen what will come of these conversations. But already the White House is weighing whether the federal government should continue to arm local police departments with military equipment in the wake of fiery protests here in Ferguson. (USA TODAY's story on that is here: [Link to usat.ly](http://usat.ly/1twD35) ) And, as I'm sure you know, Attorney General Eric Holder has personally talked about his experiences with prejudice to the people in Ferguson.
[You captured a lot with Vine. What do you think of it as a platform for capturing live news events? Do you find it limiting or challenging in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1y3vm?context=5)|I think it's an amazing platform for capturing video and getting it out quickly. It is hard to be limited to six seconds. However in this case, six second gave people a lot of information. For example, I did a vine about a peace train being made to leave the protests. It got more than 1.4 million ""loops"" because I took different angles, captured the police talking to the driver and captured it leaving.
 |Here is my vine of police asking the peace train to leave: [Link to vine.co](https://vine.co/v/M3YVwK7DKuY)

[How accurate has the mass media representation of the police response been?  What responsibility do the police have concerning the way that the protests were handled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1y2hf?context=5)|I think the media's representation of the police response has been very accurate, at least the stories I have seen. The images of armored trucks, tear gas, rubber pellets and rifles are real. I witnessed the response and did am embed with the St. Louis County Police Department's Tactical Operations Team. That said, police had a great responsibility to keep people safe and to keep businesses from being looted. I wrote a story and did a video about the police's point of view. Here is the story and video: [Link to www.usatoday.com](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/22/ferguson-st-louis-county-police/14458333/)
[As a follow up, how come most stories involving the police failed to mention the molotov cocktails being thrown, looters, and shots being fired?  Edit: This isn't intended to be a charged question, I'm actually hoping for a response.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck20vkn?context=5)|I can't speak to that. The stories USA TODAY wrote mentioned all of those and I also tweeted repeatedly about molotov cocktails being thrown, looters, and shots being fired.
[You've been able to be close to the Brown family. Has law enforcement been reaching out to her? If so, what are they saying? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1xwxl?context=5)|Darryl Parks, an attorney for Michael Brown's family, said Brown's mother met with two attorneys from the U.S. Department Justice's Civil Rights Division and two prosecutors from the office of the U.S. Attorney Eastern District of Missouri. The meeting lasted about an hour with the officials not going into details about their work but ensuring a fair and through investigation into Brown's death and possible civil rights violations. The officials didn't any specifics about their investigation plans or what they have already learned.
[How restricted are you from giving a real opinion either way on this subject, given that you work for USA Today? Won't all of your answers have to follow a guidline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1yacc?context=5)|I'm not restricted by USA Today. I haven't been given a guideline as to how to answer these questions. This is also my first AMA so I'm hoping I'm giving people the information they would like. However, I am also not a columnist so I don't give my opinion. I'm not here to offer what I think happened, or what should happen as a lot of columnists do because that is not my job. My job is to report facts and tell you what I witnessed. And, I am happy to do that.
[How did you get to be a reporter in this day and age?  (PS: Please, for the love of all that is good, continue to do EXACTLY THAT.  Report the facts - this is the problem with most news now: injecting opinion and speculation, with a side of personal bias\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck203sd?context=5)|Thanks. I got to be a reporter because I loved writing and poetry. I interned at a few places--The Miami Herald, The Seattle Times, and The Washington Post--and got lucky enough to get a job. I tell anyone who wants to be a reporter now to intern as much as you can and learn to write well. It's tough but worth it.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! In your opinion, how do you walk the line between covering the public's reaction to tragic events without sensationalizing them? What is the role of media in a case where police are seemingly brutally repressing protests, as in Ferguson?  Thanks for your time and thoughts!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1yrwy?context=5)|Ferguson was such an explosive story and experience that I just wrote what I saw. Some might see it as sensationalizing but tear gas, armored trucks, looting, fires, hundreds of protesters, and clashes with police tell the story without much addition from reporters.  I think the media's ability to capture images of protesters with their hands up in front of armored trucks told the story and allowed people to form their own opinions.
[Thank you for the work you have been doing. I live in St. Louis and have followed very few non-local reporters on Twitter during this incident.  What do you think of the Delmar divide? Does the rest of the nation have as many unaccredited public schools as the St. Louis area does? Have any of the Ferguson politicians/residents stepped up to the plate as someone who could replace Mayor Knowles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1xybf?context=5)|This is a really good question. I must say I'm not familiar with the Delmar divide. I also don't know about the statistics of unaccredited public schools around the country nor have I heard much about replacing Mayor Knowles. I have learned some about the political tensions that exist in St. Louis and read about the new Normandy Schools Collaborative. However, these are all important issues. If possible, can you inbox more information on these issues? 
[Was two weeks necessary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1xrc7?context=5)|Yes, in my opinion, two weeks was necessary because the story continued to evolve. Protesting was happening as recently as yesterday when more than a 100 people marched down a main thoroughfare in Ferguson. Also, Michael Brown's funeral was Monday, more than two weeks after his death.
[Can you tell us what you believe happened. Did he rob the store? Was he shot in the back? Did he attack the police officer in the car? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1xw1n?context=5)|I can't say what I believe happened. There just isn't enough information available. The attorney for Brown's family has said the person captured in the convenience store video ""appears to be"" Michael Brown. The autopsy done by the family's private pathologist concluded that Brown was not shot in the back.
[Do you think this has more to do with abuse of power or class than race?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2eqgwy/i_am_a_usa_today_reporter_in_ferguson_mo_i_have/ck1ye44?context=5)|That is a good question. Some experts I have talked to definitely believe that there are problems rooted in both race and class as well as abuse of power. How officers police communities is a question being asked by many people of all races, classes, and in varying neighborhoods.

2er3dq,0,2014-08-27,How do I measure up? [PhD application],[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2er3dq/how_do_i_measure_up_phd_application/,"Hey all! I'm a senior in computational mathematics (math, engineering, programming) who is looking to apply to UMass's PhD Marine Science program, although I am open to Master's admission as well which is definitely a possibility.

*Let's get numbers out of the way:*

**CGPA: 3.02**

**PGPA: 3.06**

Not super excited about those (I didn't learn to ask for help until at least my junior year), but I'm hoping I can make up for them.

*Onto GRE:*

**Old score: 1310-1320 + 5.5 AW**

**New score: 155Q, 160V, 5.5AW**

Those I'm pretty happy with, but I'm open to retaking if need be. UMass doesn't post their admittance stats, so I am nervous.

*Extracurriculars:*

**Officer/volunteer work/founder in a nation-wide math honor society**

**Officer/volunteer work in social sorority**

**Officer/volunteer work in women's engineering outreach/professional organization**

**Officer/volunteer work in campus band**

**Internship at large company in NYC doing statistical analysis**

**Work at a church for two years during school year**

I'm not sure what else I can include...the professors writing recommendations for me are very much enthusiastic about doing so, and have worked with me in various groups and volunteer activities. I've also been communicating a lot with a few professors at UMass.

When I put it all down here, I'm fairly confident that I'll at least get into the MS program, but I really need some reassurance or recommendations on what to improve. Thank you all :)"

2erx2f,1,2014-08-27,Wanting some tips on my post-grad planning/situation,TwistedMettle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2erx2f/wanting_some_tips_on_my_postgrad_planningsituation/,"Greetings, people of the redditnets. 

I will be graduating by the end of the year with a Computer Science degree and will be ready to work on January. I currently live with my parents near the Chicago area and am content with that environment. My parents will be retiring and moving to our home country early next year, which leaves me alone in regards to family in the country except for my sister and her family. 

Here's my issue: I want to move out of state to the New York City/North Jersey area after graduation. 

I do this for a couple of reasons:

*I will be severely depressed when they leave and I am genuinely scared of how I will react; my parents are EVERYTHING to me thanks to my culture and the way I grew up. I believe that moving out of my current environment will both help me avoid memories swarming at me, and will keep me too busy to do something stupid. 

*My sister and I will not NOT get along once my parents stop being here to serve as a buffer between us. I love her but she is genuinely making my blood boil lately. I am working all day and night on my computer and she assumes I'm just screwing around. She will, for example, try to make me feel guilty that my dad is cutting the grass and I'm in my desk ""playing in the computer."" I think the straw that broke the camel's back was during my two-week break between my tenures at work, where she was harassing and insulting me in front of my parents for ""not helping them with tuition"" even though practically every single penny I had made throughout college was put to that goal. 

*I want to be independent; if I stay here, it's likely that I will end up with my parent's house (which I do not want) and my sister harassing me through my parents for everything I do. i.e., I will not be truly independent. 

*I chose the greater NYC area because I like my environment of ""the big city"" with satellite towns. I have a couple of friends there so I will not completely on my own. There are, apparently, plenty of jobs there as well.

I have some experience in the field. Since the Summer, I've worked at a government research lab via a paid internship improving the build system of one of their graphical tools. I've also had some less formal experience throughout the years in the form of light web and database development. And schoolwork, of course. For references, I have my supervisors at the lab as well as the director of our division. I could also get basically all of my supervisors at past non-programming jobs as well as most of my professors. 

What I want to know is how do I do this? How do I get a job all the way over there in time for January? Who do I talk to, where do I go? I'd like to do more than just sending applications online. 

**TL;DR**: I live in Illinois, but I want to move to the greater NYC area and want to secure a job there before January. I have some experience and references. How do I do this?

Thanks, guys!

P.S.: sorry about the wall of text and formatting... I don't use reddit much.

2es2aj,17,2014-08-27,Struggling CS student in my senior year.,123491234,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/2es2aj/struggling_cs_student_in_my_senior_year/,"As the title says I feel like I'm struggling with my degree. I've started  my capstone and am in my senior year of classes and I don't feel like I know anything. My grades are fairly mediocre and I've never had an internship. The only coding I've ever done is for class projects. I've held a job at the IT department at my University for the past two years. I wouldn't mind going full time there one day, but the area I work in has nothing to do with my degree. Whenever I talk to classmates I hear about all the awesome companies they have worked for and projects they have completed and I feel like I just have nothing going for me. Through my classes I've learned Java and C++ and dabbled in Python. I have no idea how to use Linux. The only time I've ever used it was through Ubuntu on a virtual box. I barely know how to use shell and commands. I can navigate a basic file system, but that's about it. The only code I've ever written was done in xCode, Eclipse, and Visual studio. I'm willing to spend my free time learning, but at this point I'm not sure where to start. I don't have any ideas for projects or what I should be trying to learn.

* Should I try to learn new languages? 

* Should I strengthen my skills in others? I feel like my C++ is weak and my Python knowledge is almost non-existent.
* Should I dabble in web design?

I'm so lost. And I'm really afraid of graduating and being useless. I'm currently scouring /r/learnprogramming for ideas. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
2es2wf,5,2014-08-27,"Confidence changes at the drop of a hat, looking to be a bit more consistent",ssthrowaway11,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/2es2wf/confidence_changes_at_the_drop_of_a_hat_looking/,"Using a throwaway because I have friends that know my reddit account. I also apologize if this post seems to ramble, I'm really just typing everything as I think of it.

For the past 5 years or so, I've had my run-in with social anxiety. It's gotten better over time, back in my freshman and sophmore years I was always incredibly anxious, but near the end of school I think I'd finally become comfortable with myself. I have a good number of friends, although there's only 4 - 5 that I regularly talk to/hang out with.

Whenever I'm out with a friend of mine, I'm extremely confident talking to people I've just met, or people I don't know to well. I always know what to say in response to other people's comments, and I'm generally seen as a funny guy.

My main issue comes from talking to people by myself. When I meet a new person, talking to people becomes something I got really nervous about. I start racking my mind over what I should say to start a conversation, and in the back of my head I'm always worried that there's gonna be a point where the conversation just stops, and there's an awkward silence, or I'll say something wrong to upset the other person. 

This has mainly been a problem at my jobs. I have two currently, one as a host at a restaurant, and another as an IT intern at a small office (roughly around 25 people). 

At the restaurant, the people I work with are very extroverted, hang out with each other, and are good friends with each other. Whenever I talk to someone there, I get extremely nervous, and it shows when I talk. I stumble on my words, try to make jokes to lighten up the situation, and most of the time just fall flat. I can talk to guests okay when working, but that's because I generally have some kind of mental script I just read off when talking to them.

Despite that, I've gone to eat there with friends occasionally, and at that point, I'm a social butterfly. I'll be making conversation with everyone I see there, and my friends think that that's how I always am working there.

At the internship I have, it's pretty much the same story. I work in an office that's across the building, so I need to walk by quite a few people before reaching it. I try to at least interact with people there so I'm not just silently walking from the front door to my office, but all I can muster is a ""Good morning"", and on a good day ""How are you doing?"" To try and help with this, I've made it a point for me to take some time out of one day a week to go around and visit everyone, and just ask them if they've had any issues with their computers. This generally ends up being fine, but I still have the issue where I get anxious about performing it, and I still have an issue with stumbling on my words, or occasionally stuttering. 

I'll give myself some credit though, and say that I have been able to have occasional conversations with people around the office. They're never anything too long, but I've been able to walk away thinking I did alright.

When I went for the interview for that internship though, I did great. I had to meet with three separate people, and for each interview I knocked it out of the park. I managed to keep it going smoothly, made jokes to lighten the mood, and by the end of each, it was more like I was having a conversation with the interviewer then it actually being, well, an interview.

That's as much I can really say without making this a total wall of text, but I hope I've explained everything enough so you guys could understand my situation. All I really want is to be able to go to work without feeling... I guess a good word is intimidated by the people there. I really do want to always be like how I am when I'm around my friends.

Christ, just finished typing and I see this is a wall of text. Sorry about that, folks. If I didn't explain something well enough, feel free to let me know, and I'll elaborate.

&gt;EVILVOICE: **Down the hall with reason in tow, to ITDir's office we go**

&gt;**He's going to kill, and it's such a thrill**

&gt;**To think that the fuses will blow**

ITDir had just poured a 3rd (or 4th, I'm never sure with him) cup of coffee and was obviously recoilling from his conversation with NATIONALDir. 

I honestly thought I would have to quell him when he saw Level1, but he seemed relaxed. Too relaxed. He looked up from his screen, locked eyes with me, shifted his eyes to Level1, then back to mine, then back to his screen.

&gt;ITDir: Explain.

&gt;Me: It wasn't Level1, he's been on the roof the whole time.

&gt;ITDir: I know.

He motioned for me to come around to the rear of his desk, waving at his screen, and taking a long whiff of the espresso flavored steam. He was teamviewed into the HDDVR machine and had 3 screen shots. One of Level1 going into the roof exit door, and another of Tweedle and Whippy walking down the hall to the switch room. Unfortunately we didn't have a camera on that door, but the end of hall camera showed 2 figures going into the switch room with a matching time stamp.

&gt;Me: Okay then. What do we do? 

&gt;ITDir: We don't do anything. 

He looked up at me from his chair, taking a sip of his coffee for dramatic effect.

&gt;ITDir: I'm going to roast the bastards.

&gt;Level1: I'm sorry I was on the roof.

&gt;ITDir: No. I'm sorry for the situation. I'm sorry for our management. You can have the rest of the day off if you like while I resolve things. Azonic, will you finish up the switch room please?

&gt;Level1: I'd like to do it. And then I'd like to go home.

He took ownership!... ITDir noticed.

&gt;ITDir: Okay then, why don't you both do it, the users are wandering.

The door to the IT lobby opened and in walked the tour, past the CSR who had taken to licking the IT Lobby window in the absence of phones. 

&gt;CCB: And this is our final stop, the IT Department.

&gt;**THE TOURRRRrr**

EVILVOICE Growled.

CCB Was the first through the door, followed by a tallish clean shaven gentleman in slacks and a blue paisley tie and his wife, a studious woman who also wore slacks along with a slightly loose fitting, but professional looking button up blouse. Tweedle and Whippy followed behind her in single file, not speaking a word. They looked through the glass wall of ITDir's office, and upon seeing ITDir, Myself, and Level1, began to back out.

&gt;ITDir: Hi, SecurityGuy, could you please come immediately? 

*Click* 

I hadn't even seen him pick up the phone, I was too occupied with EVILVOICE's version of the *300*-esque battle that was playing out in my mind.

CCB Obliviously, and with bubbles in her voice continued:

&gt;CCB: And look, this is a rare sight, all three of our primary IT team in one place! 

&gt;ITDir: Tweedle! Whippy! Where are you going? Aren't you going to introduce me? 

The parents turned to see their children attempting to escape and with a *tisk* and a snap of the fathers head that could have cracked a whip, they re-entered the IT Door. 

&gt;Tweedle: Um. Yes, sorry sir. This is my father, FathersName, and my mother, MothersName. Mom, Dad, this is ITDir, Azonic, and Level1.

The dad shot tweedle a dissaproving look.

&gt;Dad: Tweedle, we've talked about this, you always introduce the lady in the room first! Hi...

He reached out his hand.
&gt;Pleased to meet you.

ITDir smiled a smile that wasn't a smile. 

&gt;ITDir: The pleasure is mine.

&gt;EVILVOICE: **That was good.**

The door to IT opened again and both SecurityGuy and NATIONALDir walked through. 

&gt;NATIONALDir: Did you call security? What's going on?

He knew about the switch room, but presumably didn't know the truth of it all. He looked dead at Level1 who was standing quietly next to me.

&gt;NATIONALDir: What are YOU doing here? 

ITDir jumped in.

&gt;ITDir: I was wrong. Security footage revealed that Level1 was not the one to trash the network.

Mom and Dad looked annoyed that their tour had been interrupted. They stood there, frowning dumb frowny rich people frowns. Observing what they thought was a fluke internal situation.

&gt;NATIONALDir: *Oh?*

He looked like more words were ready, but visibly restrained his thoughts after glancing at our guests. He addressed CCB, who looked more confused than usual.

&gt;NATIONALDir: Why don't we move our tour along, IT is dealing with a situation. 

&gt;ITDir: Actually, why don't you stay? 

&gt;EVILVOICE:**Man, he's on a roll today.**

Dad looked amused.

ITDir looked at national director.

&gt;ITDir: I have footage on my screen right now that shows Tweedle and Whippy entering our switch room. I also have footage showing Level1 heading up to the roof before the network ever went down. These two... *Children* shut down our network, potentially **damaging it** and wasted **my** time. Presumably to put **my guy**, who has already been told he's being ""let go"" to **make room for these two?**, into bad graces with *management*, and **ensure THEIR PROSPECTS HERE!** 

I don't think he realized that his fists were clenched. The others were silent. Mom and Dad looked confused. Tweedle cried, Whippy looked guilty... and stupid. 

Level1 had taken a seat on the couch and was staring at an opposing wall. CCB had her hand on her forehead, shielding her eyes as if to make it stop. And I was standing next to ITDir, quiet rage on my face, staring at Tweedle and Whippy.

ITDir regained his composure, everyone seemed to know better than to speak.

&gt;ITDir: SecurityGuy, please remove Tweedle and Whip-

&gt;Whippy: Mr. Stix? 

&gt;EVILVOICE:**Oh jeez**

&gt;Me: *Yes?*

&gt;Whippy: We were only trying t-

&gt;Me: Shut *Up* Whippy.

&gt;ITDir: SecurityGuy?

&gt;SecurityGuy: Come with me kids. 

Dad, with a look of *""Do you know who I am?""* defiance turned and followed. The wife, who didn't look surprised, followed in silence. 

NATIONALDir held the door while the caravan filed out of the room, ending with a ""Holy ****"" look from CCB. The door closed. 

&gt;NATIONALDir: Do we need to talk about this? 

&gt;ITDir: No. We will not be discussing this. 

&gt;NATIONALDir: Okay.

2eu5rx,0,2014-08-28,My [21 M] good friend [20M]'s sister [23F] is trying to extort money out of me after a housemate arrangement fell through. (X-post from /r/relationships),cashorfurniture,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2eu5rx/my_21_m_good_friend_20ms_sister_23f_is_trying_to/,"I was recommended by the good people or /r/relationships to post this here for advice. FYI, I'm from California.


I met one of my closest friends 3 years ago as a freshman in college--let's call him Frank. Frank is one of 7 siblings, many of which are very good friends and love to help each other out whenever they can.

Over the past three years, I've become closer friends with Frank and his family as a whole. I've been invited to countless dinners are various households, and even been described as part of the family.

Last year, Frank and I decided to find housing together since we enjoyed both working together for school and hanging out socially. However, he needed housing for the entire summer and school year, and I just needed housing for the school year due to an internship. It was agreed upon that he would live with his brother (let's call him Kyle) for the summer which was convenient for Kyle (he goes aboard 9months/year), and then I would move in at the end of the summer to take Kyle's place. As Frank and I were looking for housing, Kyle became part of the apartment search. He's known in the family as the best one at dealing with housing issues since he moves so frequently, and they've even bragged to me about how good he is at manipulating landlords to get his deposits back etc.

Frank and I spent about a week looking online and visiting places to stay, when two things changed. Kyle decided that he didn't like the uncertainty of not having housing, so he found a 3 bedroom and put money down on it. Frank knew about the place, since he had been available to go visit it, but I had not been available and had not seen the area/place at all. It was decided that Frank's sister Molly would live with Frank and Kyle for the summer (3 bedrooms), and then I would move in at the end of the summer to replace Kyle.

I was pretty shocked and unhappy with this, I really didn't like the place. It was in a bad area, and we would later learn that it was infested with cockroaches. However, it was cheap, and it was with people I liked, despite being close to Kyle's work and over 8 miles from campus for Frank and I. Towards the end of the summer, there was a little overlap between when Kyle and I wanted to live in the apartment, and since there was plenty of space, it was agreed that I could leave my furniture (including kitchen wares, tv, etc) for their use.

That was all fine, and housing with them was good enough (except for the commute and cockroaches) for the remainder of the year. Last may, I started looking into housing with Frank's other sister Caitlyn. Caitlyn was moving to the area where we all lived, and she was trying to find a place that was cheap with someone she could trust (Frank was graduating and moving away). We decided it would be good to live together, since I was already so close to the rest of her family.

Like the previous summer, I had an internship, this time 1500 miles away. We agreed that Kyle would take my room for the summer, and we'd do a similar deal as the previous summer with a few differences. My stuff would be stored there, TV, Kitchenware, furniture, etc, and Kyle would use my bed since he didn't have one.

Unfortunately, just like the previous summer, Kyle went over my (and Caitlyn's) heads and put down a deposit on an apartment that was near his work--this time 13 miles from campus for me (fool me twice, shame on me. =/). The first time I actually saw the place, was when Kyle, Caitlyn, and Frank helped me move my stuff and Molly's couch (Kyle's summer furniture) into the place along with moving Caitlyn in at the same time.

I was even less happy with the housing this time around, it was way dirtier in a way worse neighborhood (my neighbors looked like meth addicts), and I felt like I was regressing massively in quality of life despite my greatly increased income for this summer. It was all very fast, and within 3 days of moving my stuff in, I was off on a plane to another state.

Note: since I wasn't part of either housing selection, I never ended up on either lease.

I had growing anxiety about living at that place throughout the summer until early august when I started looking at other housing options. I found an affordable place under a mile from campus with a good friend, and I decided that I needed to take it for my own sanity and well being. On August 10th (over a month before I'd be moving in) I let Caitlyn know how sorry I was and explained my feelings to her. She was very understanding and said that she didn't like the place either and fully empathized with me because Kyle had put her in the horrible housing without her consent as well. We both spent some time looking for a new roommate for her, and I even researched ways to break her lease (uncleanliness/drug abuser neighbors). I was over the moon with how easy it had been and how there were no hard feelings at all--the optimal outcome.

Fast forward three weeks to yesterday when I received a very long facebook message. Caitlyn explained how hard it had been for her to find a roommate, especially with all of my furniture and boxes in the house. She outlined how her brothers had gone to a bunch of trouble to move my stuff and how she's gone to a bunch of trouble to unpack my things. She had some written calculations about the damages she had incurred as a ""storage unit"" for me, and offered me an ultimatum. I can either send her a check for the amount of money she deemed I owed her ""no later than September 6th"", or she would claim all of my possessions (about 6x the value of her demand) as collateral. I needed to come and claim my stuff for by the 20th, or again, my stuff would be claimed as collateral. She then went on to say that there are NO HARD FEELINGS!

I have no idea how to feel about this. My initial reaction is that I should just pay it, the deal we made had been very helpful to me this summer. I make quite a bit more money than her, and while its a lot, it's definitely affordable to me. At the same time I felt completely manipulated and extorted. It took her 3 weeks to go from ""everything is fine, I understand"" to ""give me x dollars or I will claim your possessions"". The entire email was very nasty and details the painstaking efforts she and her family went to to assist me. However, she did me the kindness of explicitly stating that she wouldn't be charging me for her family's moving services or her unpacking services, merely the storage fee. There is no mention whatsoever about the convenience for Kyle to use my bed over the summer, or for either of them to use my TV and Kitchen supplies.

This feels like extortion to me. What if I hadn't checked my Facebook? Would my stuff be gone without my knowledge by the 6th? I was given no choice or discussion in the matter whatsoever, which tells me that she has no impression that I would actually help her out unless she strongarmed me. I feel like I'm in a completely lose lose situation, where two possibilities exist. She doesn't give a shit enough about me to decide to extort money out of me now that she has the opportunity, or she has such a low opinion of me that she doesn't think I would help her out at all if she asked instead of demanded.

The worst part is that I would've happily given her this amount of money, perhaps more, if she had come to me and asked for help. If she had told me that she's struggling financially and that my decision to not be her roommate has caused her a financial burden, I would've been more than happy to assist her. Instead I have this awful taste in my mouth and feel like my relationship with their family has been completely destroyed by her demands.

Returning to my comments about how she thinks her brother is ""very good"" at dealing with apartment matters, there is no doubt in my mind that this was written by him and edited by her. I feel like this is the third dump he's taken on me with absolutely no respect for me or for my relationship with the rest of his siblings.

At this point, I have no idea how to deal with it. I called her immediately last night and said I would be willing to pay, but I wanted to talk about it. I was scared that she was attempting to have no further communication with me since the email was so airtight and I was unable to contact her in any way. Now I'm not so sure I'm happy just sending a check. If she's willing to extort me, who's to say that she isn't willing to just take my stuff. How do I know that my stuff is in ""storage condition"" and that nothing has been lost, broken, or damaged.

I left her a message last night asking to talk to her ASAP, and she texted me this morning that she'd be able to talk after work tonight. Can you offer any advice with how to deal with this? Am I being unreasonable and should I just pay? Is there anything else I can do?

At the end of the day, she has the keys and my stuff, and I'm 1500 miles away for another 4 weeks.

tl;dr: My best friend from college's sister is demanding that I send her a check or she will claim all of my possessions as ""collateral"".

Then got another offer the next day with standard salary but demanding work,jkt11,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2eu7ob/need_advice_asap_fresh_fraduate_has_accepted/,"So at 19 august i started sending cv after a month enjoying life at my hometown. Well, then i got intern offer with half the standard salary. The boss give me 5 days to answer. In 5 days, i didnt get any offer so feeling desperate i took the job. The internship should be start by sept 1st until 31st des, then he will consider for full employee.
Then the next day i got call for another interview. The boss is husband and wife, and because it is house slash office, they dont hire a lot of people. Like 2 person max. They give me test, and i m kinda pestimistic and not really enjoying because the work environment is really working non stop. I am doing this office lobby 3d as the test
So i asked who drawing the 2d and turns out he s the only one drawing it. As comparison,  this type of project usually needs at least 2 drafter. 
Surprisingly, they offer me the job with standard salary for fresh graduate. And they asked for long term commitment, they dont want people who quit in a few months. yes it will be better than the intern job. But the intern job is so close from home, while this one need 1-1.5 hours to reach it. This one will be better in cv. But this one will be super stressful and hectic. 
Then i also got offer for drafter at office furniture mass production supplier, it will be give me the most money, but it will be the least usefull experience for long term

Tldr:
Intern 
-2 boss, 5 employee, medium project, interior designer
-should be fun and ok experince
-half the standard salary
-4 month minimum commitment
-close from home

Full employee
-2 boss, 1 senior (with me will be 2 employee), medium architecture project like 8 storey office
-will give super stressfull but usefull experince
-standard salary
-1 year minimum commitment
-so far far away from home (long commute)

drafter
-mass production for office furniture, big company
-will be the least usefull experince
-1.3 x standard salary
-close from home

By the way i suppossed to answer number 1 n 2 by friday. (To starting work at sept 1st) and number 3 give me a week"
2eu8kf,35,2014-08-28,One faculty member's advice for 3rd years in science and engineering.,dfordon,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2eu8kf/one_faculty_members_advice_for_3rd_years_in/,"**Decide.**

PhD program. Med school. Industry. Law school. A master’s degree program. A professional master’s degree program. Teach for America. Starfleet Academy. Companion to The Doctor. Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. *Et cetera.* 
  
Figure out which of these you’re interested in and competitive for, and prepare a plan of attack for each. The senior year should be devoted to implementation, not planning.
  

**Be suspicious of your lifelong goals.**

I’ve heard many students tell me that they’ve wanted to a doctor or a professor since they were children. Now that you know what a doctor or a professor actually does, is that still true?
  
If I was beholden to a career chosen by my nine year old self, I would currently be the worst Jedi ever.
  

**If you don’t know why you need graduate training, you don’t need graduate training (yet).**

If you go to graduate school because you “like school”, want to put off making a decision, please your parents, or because it seems like the next thing to do - you will likely be miserable, and you’ll be paying for that misery with your time and money.
  

**If you’re interested in a PhD program...**

Schedule, study for, and take the GRE. Plan to have three strong letters of recommendation, at least two of which are from people you’ve done research or interned with. Get started on your essays, which should go through endless drafts and many reviewers, each of whom you owe either beer, fancy chocolate, or comments on their own essays. Plan to apply for an NSF fellowship. (If you don’t apply for an NSF fellowship, you’re not sufficiently serious about graduate school.) Look into the NDSEG, DoE, and (if your resume burns with the power of a thousand suns) the Hertz fellowship as well.

Identify eight or more programs, each with at least two labs you’d be happy to work in, in locations you won’t mind making your home for five years.
  

**If you’re interested in med school...**

Schedule, study for, and take the MCAT. Plan to have three strong letters of recommendation, at least two of which are from people you’ve done research or interned with. Get started on your essays, which should go through endless drafts and many reviewers, each of whom you owe either beer, fancy chocolate, or comments on their own essays.
  

**If you’re interested in industry...**

Internships are, from the employer’s point of view, an extended interview. Get yourself an internship. Network. If an event on campus boasts industry guests in your field, go to it. Do practice interviews. Have your resume reviewed by people that know what they’re doing.
  

**Become a mentor.**

You remember what is was like in your first year? Chances are you got a lot of help from students in their 3rd and 4th years. Congratulations! You are now that person. Own it.
  

**Manage your online persona.**

Your public photo album named “kegstands and other tomfoolery” is unlikely to impress future employers.


**Plan to publish.**

No matter your trajectory, having your name on a published or in-press paper when you graduate is useful. Talk to the people you’re researching with, and ask them what the plan for publication is. Be honest about your goals, and tell ‘em you’re willing to do what it takes to make that publication a reality.
  
Research is always a risk, and the publication might not happen. That’s fine. At worst, you’ve proven your dedication to the lab and demonstrated your professionalism.
  

**Make a graduation “bucket list”.**

Don’t spend the first few years of your postgraduate life kicking yourself for not participating in campus traditions or taking advantage of the area you’re currently living in. Outside of academics, what do you want to do before you graduate? Write those things down. Then start making them happen.

A little background, I am going to be a junior at college going into Actuarial Science. This resume will be for internship purposes.

1. Should I put my Freshman year college on my resume if I transferred after one year? They are both state schools and are about equal in status.

2. How can I put on my resume that I was the ""go to guy"" for my boss to call if he needed help with anything? I can't think of great wording to make it sound not embellished. Just a simple relationship where I was the first and only call he'd have to make to get something done.

3. How can I express that I am currently learning VBA and C programming languages, and will have those skills (at least at a basic level) by semester end.

Thanks a lot for any input!

Also in high school I was voted most likely to become a billionaire, and I think that is relevant to my entrepreneurial spirit. Could that make its way onto my resume, or is it too obscure?

EDIT 2  
Think I got it.  
END EDIT 2  

Father got a call from a friend who has a small accountants office.  
The backup solution they had wasn't working properly any more and they no longer had a way to contact their previous tech.  
Father asked me to go there, take a look, fix whatever I could and write up a nice bill.  
So, on adventure to the accountants I go.   

Small company, 8 people, one of which was an intern.  
The owner wanted to give me the grand tour of the place, with, if I didn't mind, the intern coming along too.  
As the intern was a 20 year old cute redhead, I didn't mind.  
So, after the tour (offices, break room and coffee machine), I go to work.    

&gt; Me: Ok, so what's the problem with the backups?  
&gt; Owner: One of the accountants messed around with the server, thought he know what he was doing and now the backup program is gone.  

...Are you serious?

&gt; Me: Well, in that case I'd better go to work. Where do you have the server?  
&gt; Owner: Right here, follow me.  

So I did. To a glorified storage cupboard.  
The server being a Win 7 workstation.  
Was left alone, went looking through Program Files and the registry for anything that included the word ""backup"".  
They didn't know the exact name of the program.  
When the searching didn't turn up anything, I went looking around a bit more.  
Documents, trash, downloads, nothing.  
Decide to check the scheduled tasks.  
And there it was.  

""SuperBackup2013"", to execute every day at 10PM.  
First thought with that name was a random piece of crapware like the millions of optimizers floating around.  
It seemed that the program was at ""I:\SuperBackup2013\Backup.bat"".  
Closed Scheduled Tasks, processed this information, opened it again, re-read that.  
&gt; Me: Wait, what? .bat? WTF?  

""I:"" turned out to be a flash drive in the back of the machine with a label attached which said ""DO NOT TOUCH! VITAL FOR THE BACKUPS!"".  
The ""Superbackup2013"" folder was gone.  
Plugged in my own flash drive, ran Recuva, got it back.  
Made a copy of the folder to my own flash drive.  

The owner came by while Recuva was working.  

&gt; Owner: So, how's it going? Can you fix this?  
&gt; Me: I'm hopeful. Should be done within half an hour.  

And off he went.

Decided to check out my findings.
The entire file?  

    @echo off
    title SuperBackup 2013 - PreviousTech'sName Productions  
    copy ""C:\BusinessCriticalSoftware\DataBase\current.db"" ""I:\SuperBackup2013 - 2\backup.db""  
    cls  
    exit  

Ran the file to test, worked.  
Changed the scheduled task to run after a minute, worked.  
Went to break room for a coffee, ran into intern who had the same idea.  
We started talking.  
Kept talking for about half an hour when she got called back to the offices.  
Before she went back, we exchanged phone numbers. This did not turn out to be a good idea.  
On a totally 100% unrelated note, I've switched numbers 3 times in 6 months now.  
Also, whoever figures out a way to detect when hindsight triggers the red lights and sirens as soon as it happens instead of after it's far too late, please let me know.    

Anyway, went to the owner for a little chat.    

&gt; Me: Hey Owner, got a minute?  
&gt; Owner: Yeah, sure. What's up?  
&gt; Me: I'm done. The backups are working again.  
&gt; Owner: Fantastic, absolutely fantastic. From now on, anytime we need something, I'll give you a call.  
&gt; Me: Appreciated. If I may ask, I saw OldTech's name on the backup program. Did he make it specifically for you?  
&gt; Owner: Yeah, he did. He was working on it for a week, nonstop.  
&gt; Me: A week? Wow. What was the price tag?  
&gt; Owner: €249,99. Cheap, huh?  
&gt; Me: ...Yeah, it is. Though I did notice a little problem.  
&gt; Owner: Oh? what is is?  
&gt; Me: It's a bit outdated by now. You might want to look into a professional backup solution, that would provide you with a lot more stability.  
&gt; Owner: I'll think about it. Now, what's the bill?  
&gt; Me: Total cost would end up at €30.  
&gt; Owner: Wow, you're cheap. Listen:  

At this point, he pulls out a €50 and hands it to me.  

&gt; Owner: Your father said you dropped everything you were doing and came here. You're friendly. You started and kept going until you finished. And you're not asking much. Take it. And like I said, if we ever need anything again, I'll come to you.  
&gt; Me: Well, in that case, thank you. Let me know when you need me again and I'll be here ASAP.  

Owner walked with me to the front door, I said goodbye to everyone as we passed the offices, intern gave me a wink.  

We shake hands, say goodbye, and just when I get on my bike, he says  
&gt; Owner: And I saw you talking with Intern. Just so you know, she'll be here for about 4 more months. Come by to chat whenever you like.  

With a giant grin on his face as he walked back inside.    

The next day, he gave me a call.  
They accountant who deleted the backup program?  
Wanted to see if the backup was all encompassing.  
Turned out the program didn't back itself up.  "
2ev328,178,2014-08-28,What university students need to know about getting an internship at one of the top 5 tech companies,AlwaysBeFunctional,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ev328/what_university_students_need_to_know_about/,"Hey fellow CS/CE students,

I just discovered this subreddit and I noticed a lot of university students have questions about getting an internship at some of the top 5 tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft).  
  
I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering student and I've completed internships at 2 of those 5 companies and will be doing an internship at a 3rd next summer, so I thought it would be helpful to summarize some of the things I've learned throughout the process.  
  
**Connections/networking is important**  
  
Knowing someone inside a company you want to work at is the fastest path for applying for an internship or job there. The standard way to apply for an internship is by filling out an online application, but these companies process thousands of these applications and yours can easily be filtered. Even if they choose you to go forward with interviews, the process can take many months.  
  
I built a network of connections in the industry (specifically in the Bay Area) through social networking, contributing to open source projects, conferences, mutual friends, and coworkers. This was harder for me because I live in Canada, but the internet makes it much easier than you'd think. It's important that your connections are aware of your skills and have some knowledge of the projects you've worked on in the past. Take opportunities to meet up with people for coffee and lunch to discuss your experiences and learn more about theirs.  
  
Thanks to help from friends at these companies, I was able to go from sending in my resumé to receiving an internship offer in the course of ~2 weeks in several cases.  
  
**Side projects set you apart from the crowd**  
  
A CS/CE degree, even with a high GPA, won't set you apart from everyone else that is applying for the same internship. Every time I've applied to one of the top 5, the first thing they've asked me about is the side projects that I've worked on. They will often ask about your experiences in developing your projects, challenges you've faced, and how you solved a particularly complex problem.  
  
In my case, I have a few commercial apps that I'm currently selling (and have sold in the past) as well as a significant number of open source projects on GitHub. This is my process for figuring out projects I want to work on. It may or may not be applicable to others:  
  
* Pinpoint a task that you perform on a regular basis that could be improved through writing some software. It doesn't necessarily need to be something that is marketable -- you could just write it for your own personal use (which can end up turning into a marketable product if you realize that a lot of people could benefit from it). This could be anything from a better mobile Reddit app to a script to automatically build the timetable for your upcoming semester.
* Learn the languages, frameworks, toolchains, services, etc. you need to build it. A lot of this learning happens *while* you're building the product. You don't need to sit down with a pile of books and learn everything beforehand.
* In the course of developing this project, did you write a particular component that could be useful for other developers even outside your app? Polish it up and open source it. Nothing says more about your actual coding ability than code that your prospective employers can read and evaluate instantly.  
  
**Know more than one programming language**  
  
Make sure you are proficient with at least one of the most common programming languages (C, C++, Python, Java). Some companies will let you do your interviews in a language of your choice, but many will insist that you write code in one of those languages. Having experience with functional programming languages (Haskell, Scala, etc.) is also a huge bonus and will only become *more* important over time.  
  
**Know what to expect from interviews**  
  
The knowledge you need to perform well in an interview is not the same knowledge you'll need to do your job on a day to day basis. Many people who have phenomenal practical skills don't have interview skills and vice versa. These are the topics that I've found to be prevalent in past interviews:  
  
* Data structures
    * Linked lists
    * Arrays
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Binary trees
    * Hash tables/maps
    * Strings
* Algorithms
    * Time complexity
    * Space complexity  
  
There are a wide array of specific questions that fall under these general topics. Look up common interview questions for your company of choice and do some of them to prepare.  
  
**Your GPA doesn't matter**  
  
Many companies won't even inquire about your GPA, and the ones that do will use it mainly as supplementary information in making a decision. The primary weight comes from your past experience (previous employment and side projects) and your performance during the interviews.   
  
**Never stop learning**  
  
Keep up to date with what's happening in the industry. The tech industry moves at light speed. Do lots of reading, have discussions with others in the industry on a regular basis, and always be experimenting with new languages and paradigms. Doing so ensures that you will always have relevant experience, which will be a huge asset when it comes to finding a job after graduation.  
  

I would be happy to answer any further questions (without giving away personal details).

2ev45k,1,2014-08-28,Dealing with Conservative/Religious Parent.,yimey,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ev45k/dealing_with_conservativereligious_parent/,"My mother is a very religious and conservative Christian who doesn’t really tolerate other beliefs, at least not in her household. On the other hand, I have liberal views and wouldn't consider myself ""religious"" or ""christian"" since I don't necessarily believe in any particular religion. I'm sixteen and still living with her, and even though I try my best to keep from discussing politics or religion, it always causes conflict between us. 

Right now I'm really focusing on school and my career by overloading my self with college coursework, SAT prep, and internships since I'm working really hard to attend college on scholarship. 

However, my mother insists that I complete a religious course program that is offered in her church. It requires a lot of time and dedication in order to complete it (lesson plans, projects, memorization, and exams). I completed the first two preceding levels in elementary and middle school, but since then my life has had a complete turn around. Not only do I not have the time I used to, I am now completely against many of the things that this course teaches and stands for. 

Completion of this course would require massive time, effort, and disrespect/disregard of my own beliefs. I don't want to take time out of my day to have to learn or make a project about how homosexuals are going to hell when I don't believe that homosexuality is a sin or that hell is a real place. I hate hypocrisy and I couldn’t stand to do this and become one myself.

She says it is “very important” to her for me to graduate from the course and have the ceremony because it will help me  “grow spiritually”, but she doesn’t realize that having me do this is a disrespect of my beliefs. She doesn’t know that this is the issue because she doesn’t know what I believe in; I can't tell her because she would make it a big recurring issue between us just as she has for any disagreement that I try to peacefully discuss with her regarding religion or politics. At the end of it she always ends up yelling that I can have my own beliefs that will lead me into the pit of hell once I move out. 

Although I feel strongly about this, I still respect my mother's beliefs and don't want to have yet another argument and damage our relationship any further. I already tried to emphasise how much work this requires and how little time I have because of school, but she insists that it’s not that difficult or time consuming (so this argument isn’t working).

So how can I explain this to her and go about a peaceful resolution where I don't have to take time from my day and go against my own beliefs and she doesn't give me hell for having my own beliefs and try to further forcibly convert me?

2ev8ju,1,2014-08-28,Which job should I choose?,BadAppleThrow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ev8ju/which_job_should_i_choose/,"A good problem to have, I suppose. Some info about me: 21m, NoVA area, senior college student, NOT paying my own way. Majoring in economics, but my entire work history is in IT.

Job A:

* Recommended to me by a family friend  
* Required skill set is different from anything I have done before. I expressed concern about this at the interview, but the interviewer told me it would be fine.
* Would last a month guaranteed, but after that they may keep me on working on an economics-related project-- my first economics-related work experience. I would be an intern, so they could only keep me a max of 6 months before either hiring me or letting me go.
* Located in DC, so the train would cost ~$10.20/day round trip and the commute would be ~1.5 hours round trip.  
* They contract out to the World Bank, so I would be able to put that on my résumé, which is important at my age. That's probably the biggest advantage of this job.
* Pay would be $14/hr

Job B: 

* Desktop support job, which fits my skill set perfectly  
* Located ~13 miles away, which Google Maps tells me is 1.25 hrs each way by bike (so 2.5 hrs round trip)  
* I found this job on Craigslist about 2.5 months ago. 2 weeks after contacting them they responded and asked me for a phone interview, which I obliged. They told me they wanted to set up an in person interview, so I gave them some dates and times I would be available. Never heard back. Then fast forward 2 months, and last week I got an email from the IT director asking me for a Skype interview. I interviewed, and he told me he ""definitely wants to bring me on."" I do now have the offer sitting in my inbox, but the 2 month gap seems somewhat fishy. I casually brought it up during the interview and he said they were scrambling to set up new offices and he wanted someone to interview me who wasn't available and it just ended up on the back burner. Okay....
* Pay is $15/hr

Job C:

* Would be located right on campus, a 5 minute bike ride  
* Flexible scheduling around school  
* This is somewhat of a support job, though I would be supporting some applications I'm not incredibly familiar with
* Found this job through a friend who is leaving, so I bypassed the standard protocol for applying to on campus jobs
* I don't actually have an offer letter yet, but I do have an offer for an interview, and I fully expect I can get the job
* Pay would be AT MOST $10/hr

TL'DR: Need to choose between a job that looks good on my résumé, a job that pays well, and a job that is convenient. What are your thoughts?"

I consider myself pretty darn good at creating apps and most importantly, solving problems (that's what they teach in engineering school anyways). 

I've never had a full time job or an internship in web development, but I have some experience freelancing.

I don't claim to be an expert at this at all. I'm just an American Francophile who was researching ways to get out one night and wanted to put her findings together. This information is as much for me as it is for you all, so I appreciate constructive comments. I apologize in advance if I fail to present a viable option or if I falsely present information.... Like what I apparently did with the title itself, which should be more accurately called,

**""So you're a *non-EEA/EFT national* who wants to move to France...""**

* EEA (European Economic Area) : Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom
* EFTA (European Free Trade Association): Switzerland, Iceland, Norway &amp; Liechtenstein

(Thanks to /u/Chomskyismyhero and /u/filthyeuropean for pointing this out)

____

Before we start - if you know nothing about moving to France AT ALL, you should at least read this article on [living and working in France](http://french.about.com/od/travelfrance/a/liveworkinfrance.htm) to get the basic understanding of the procedure and difficulties. 

**Next, an explanation of your need to know terms:**

* *Visa de long séjour* - long stay visa. If you plan to stay in France longer than your tourist visa allows you (usually 90 days), then you need to apply for one of these. They come in different forms, depending on your situation. Apply if you are: employed (with at least a year-long contract by a French company), a temporary worker (with a contract between three months and one year), a scientific researcher, a student or intern, an au pair, the spouse of a French citizen, the spouse of foreign national legally living in France and wish to be reunited, coming to France as a visitor (not working) and have sufficient funds to live off during your stay.

* *Titre de séjour/carte de séjour* - renewable temporary residency permit valid up to and between 1-3 years. If your visa bears the words *carte de séjour à soliciter*, you must go to the préfecture (government administrative office) to apply for a residence permit. If you want to extend your visa/permit, then you must go back to your préfecture for an extension (*prolongation de visa*), within two months of expiry, together with supporting documents (aka proof of continuing employment/studies).

* *Carte de résidence* - renewable permenant residency permit valid up to 10 years. You may apply for this once you have lived in France for certain amount of continuous years. It is usually five, but the amount is entirely dependent on how your stay in France (whether you were a student, in the French Foreign League, in a civil union – to be discussed below). Unfortunately, you lose the right to permanent residence if you leave France for more than two consecutive years.

* *Naturalisation* - You acquire French citizenship. Similar to the process of the carte de résident where you must stay for a certain amount of years. The difference is that you’re actually accepting France as your country, meaning when you apply at your préfecture they really judge you to determine if you’re integrated into French society (i.e. by language skills and understanding of rights and responsibilities of a French citizen).

* *Paperwork* - A dirty word that every expat in France hates because it means keeping track of every scrap of **original** paperwork that documents your French immersion. Includes, but is not limited to: bank statements, apartment leases, property deeds, utility bills, medical records, school transcripts, work contracts, etc. 

----

And finally, my walk through of your most attainable options:

**If you have just enough money to buy a plane ticket and you're unskilled with little to no knowledge of the language, BUT you are eager to explore France RIGHT NOW:**

* [Be an au pair](http://www.aupair-world.net/au_pair_program/france/au_pair). Au pairs are 18-30 year olds who are invited/sponsored by a family to live and work for them for them up to 18 months (1 year initially then with extension). You can do this year after year until you're basically too old to work. The term literally means ""on par"" - so you're supposed to be on par or basically a member of the family. Usually you will only need the slightest grasp of French, because you were mainly hired to speak your language to their kids. Your duties are to take care of the kids and light housework in exchange for room, board, a small weekly/monthly stipend, and French classes. In fact, because you are taking French classes - you will be arriving with a type of long-term student visa which is valid as long as your work contract (titre de séjour). Check [Great Au Pair](http://www.greataupair.com) (more detailed but you have to pay to message directly) or [Au Pair World](http://www.aupair-world.net.) (You can message anyone for free but the profiles don't show salary/specific city) for opportunities.

* Sign up for the [French Foreign Legion](http://fr.legion-recrute.com/index.phpen/salaires.php?SM=0). Only for males over 18 though. Basically, the FFL is an small army composed entirely of foreign nationals within the actual French army. According to this [American Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cvjdb/iaman_american_who_joined_and_served_in_the/) who joined, ""Historically, the Legion has been a place where ""serious fuck ups"" can go receive a new life and, along with that, a second chance."" Of course, not all fucks will make it. You must first go through their boot camp in Aubagne, France  where you'll be given test after test to see if you're medically, psychologically, academically, and physically worthy. You actually don't have to speak a lick of French, but knowledge of the language gives you an advantage over the other recruits. Drug history and criminal records will ding you. Apparently, even if you don't make the cut - they will give you a [stipend for your time](http://www.vice.com/read/i-tried-joining-the-french-foreign-legion). If you do pass, you're signed on to a five year contract. It's salaried around $50,000 a year and you are able to apply for French citizenship immediately – (although I hear you should still wait a couple of years at least). They will also teach you French, of course.

* Try [WWOOFing](http://www.wwoof.fr/wwoofing.htm). THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU IN ACTUALLY IMMIGRATING to France because you would just be going under a tourist visa. I only listed it for those who just want to have a feel of living in the country for a time but you’re broke. You do manual labor on farms, vineyards, etc in exchange for room and board. It is feels like a job, but you're not qualified to apply for a long-stay visa under this and you're not actually being paid money.

* [Work legally for 90 days](http://www.campusfrance.org/en/page/countries-whose-nationals-need-not-obtain-a-visa-stays-3-months-or-less). Like WWOOFing above, THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU IN ACTUALLY IMMIGRATING because you would be just going under a tourist visa. However, unlike WWOOFing, this option allows you to live in France and  pursue *paid* employment.. but only for 90 days (aka regular tourist visa length maximum). It is reserved solely for citizens of Albania,* Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Barbados, Bosnia,* Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Malaysia, Mauritius, Monaco, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Vatican City, Seychelles, Taiwan (passport must include identity card number), Uruguay, Montenegro,* Macedonia,* and Serbia.* (* exemption applies only to holders of biometric passports)
(Credits to /u/poorfag for discovering this option!)

**If your French still sucks, BUT you have at least a few thousand in saving and you want to live in France RIGHT NOW:**

* Sign up for French classes. For as little as [750 euros](http://www.france-langue.com/) you can get yourself 12 weeks of French classes and a visa up to a year depending on how you wrangle it (aka renew it). Alliance Francaise is the most renowned and expensive, but there are [plenty of other schools](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/03/french-classes/) that will do the same job and most importantly - get you a long stay visa. You will still have to find housing on your own, but even that's relatively safe and easy now with sites like AirBnB where rooms around the country will go for as little [$10 a day](https://www.airbnb.com/s/france?price_max=20&amp;sw_lat=43.21944292735488&amp;sw_lng=-3.4664432749999605&amp;ne_lat=50.01641878121862&amp;ne_lng=6.9046504750000395&amp;zoom=6&amp;search_by_map=true). Also there's [Craigslist in France](http://paris.en.craigslist.fr/) and the French equivalent [Le Bon Coin](http://www.leboncoin.fr/), but there's the international transactions sketch factor. You need to qualify for this student visa though by proving to the French government that you're financially stable. Basically, they just want to see that you have enough money in your bank account that you won't suddenly go broke one and be a drain on their system.

* [Apply for a one year working holiday visa](http://pvtistes.net/le-pvt/) (*permis vacances travail*)... BUT only if you're between 18-30 years of age AND a citizen of: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Russia. As the name implies, a PVT will allow you to work in France. You'll have to have at least a couple thousand euros in your bank account to prove financial stability in France as the idea is to supplement your funds with your perhaps not well paying work. You'll also need to show that you will full health insurance coverage abroad as the French won't cover you in social welfare. Act fast though because quotas do apply to each country. (Merci to /u/No_regrats for pointing this option out. As an ineligible American, I am thoroughly jealous).

**If you ARE educated and skilled and all that jazz but you're just not fancy enough to get French companies to sponsor you:** 

* Take classes wherever you are now. Get yourself ready! It doesn't matter whether it's at some fancy ivy league, public university, community college, or even non-credit adult school... Just go to any place of learning. First you need to choose a skill that you love that's applicable abroad. Graphic designer, Engineering, Teaching English as a Foreign Language, Hotel Management. Second, TAKE FRENCH CLASSES. Master the language. Aim for fluency. There are even Alliance Francaise schools like the one I previously mentioned ALL OVER THE WORLD! Take cultural courses as well - ones that teach you French history, government, business ethics, etc. All of the above will better help you integrate into the country in terms of making friends and finding a job. Also (if you're American) check out [this site](http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/) by the French government if you're truly that committed to immersing yourself in the French language and culture. They offer many travel scholarships and paid teaching opportunities for those who went through higher education.

* Go to university abroad. The Fall term has just started in most schools, so you'll have to apply for the Spring Semester, at least. Don't just temporarily study abroad. Really STUDY abroad. There are plenty of other actual French universities though that have (English speaking!) programs that cater to foreign students abroad looking to broaden their education. Your long stay student visa will allow you to work side jobs and apply for professional paid internships. This will help your integration tremendously as employers may actually recognize your school and work experience. If you live in France for at least two years and have a degree from a French university - waiting time for French residency is reduced from five years to two years. This applies to undergraduate/masters/PhD. Check [Campus France](http://www.campusfrance.org/en/) to learn which school best fits you.

**If you are in a serious relationship with a French national, but just not ready to get married yet:** 

* [Get PACSed]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_solidarity_pact). Stands for *pacte civil de solidarité*, which translates to a civil union. Originally, this was created by the government as a way for same-sex couples to be legally acknowledged for their relationship, because marriages weren’t allowed. PACSed unions receive many [(but not all)]( http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F1026.xhtml) of the same benefits as married couples such as tax credits and the ability to be sponsored by your French “partner” for a long-stay visa. Once you prove to the préfecture that you’ve lived together for at least 3 years continuously or 5 years apart, then you can apply for permanent residency or citizenship. Again, this is why you need to save your documents. You need to show your cohabitation.

**TL;DR:** *To actually live in France as a permanent resident (up to 10 years at a time) or become a naturalized citizen (stay there forever), you first need to show RESIDENCY of 2-5 years worth of long-term visas, depending on how you enter. You can get this by working as au pair, studying, joining the French Foreign Legion, or signing into a civil union. Each one will change the amount of years you have to wait to apply for long-term residency (5, 2, 0, 3 - respectively). In the end though, you just gotta collect those cartes de séjours. Once you have enough it’s all about its evolution into a carte de résident or naturalization. Also, take everything I say with a grain of salt.*

**Disclaimer:** Again, I'm no immigration authority nor can I offer an legal counsel in this.

This shows because I only meet up with them individually maybe once every two months, and even then, with such a long time of not seeing each other, it's still a pain to keep the conversation going for an hour. Usually, without fail, the conversations cover the following, in no particular order:

1. School/work/general life - ""So how's your internship going?""

2. Current events - ""Did you hear about the plane crash at SFO?""

3. Common interest - (usually only NBA) ""How about them Lakers?"" Barring that, I try to talk about some interest I know that they have.

4. Activity/event where we met - ""Ready for the next volunteering event?""

5. Other experiences - When my friends sense the convo is starting to die, they restart it with all the other social experiences they've been having, eating at this place or doing that thing with some other friends. Of course I got nothing because the sitdown at that very moment is literally the only real socializing I've done the entire month.

I guess it follows the FORD topics to an extent, but I think they're best when you meet someone new and not as something to regurgitate with real friends after already knowing them. I guess the only topic I could see talking about on a daily basis is the common interest, but realistically I could maybe talk for 5 minutes about the Lakers each day before it gets real old. I don't have to be talking with every person every single day, but I know to develop close relationships I have to at least do that for the people who I want to get close to.

So instead of more conversation techniques that are general, I just want to ask you what specifically you talk about with someone who you converse very regularly/consider a real friend. How did you get to the point where you have inside jokes and are cracking insults at each other in good fun? I apologize if this question sounds stupid, I'm just woefully inept at socializing. I cannot imagine how some people are able to have 5+ hours of phone conversations with the same person several times a week. I have thought about taking someone's phone and just poring through and analyzing all their text conversations, but I'll have to settle for asking this question lol.

**TL;DR**: What specifically do you talk about with your closest friends or people who you talk almost daily with? I'd like to know because I have a terrible time keeping conversations fresh and always end up talking about the same things."

Graduated a few months ago with a masters in Mechanical Engineering. Foolishly i never got an internship or work placement. Now im looking to get some kind of entry-level graduate scheme. I feel this is probably the best approach.

However, i have this constant fear that im not going to be able to do whatever job i may get. I feel the work will be too much and i simply wont be able to get it done, in over my head if you will.

Did anyone else struggle with this kind of anxiety before obtaining their first working position? "

[Thanks for the AMA! A few questions: How do you incorporate marketing research and goals into your creative work? I'm in a creative role for a highly dysfunctional DI athletics marketing department, and the means and ends just never seem to add up; We just do whatever anyone asks for.  What's the most challenging aspect of communicating a creative vision to those who aren't creatively inclined (clients, account reps, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2tk76?context=5)|From what I've experienced, creatives generally have a strained relationship with client-side market research or ""testing,"" because it's usually where our ideas go to die. We might write a number of tv scripts that get sold through to the client, but in wanting to protect their investment, the client will put them through rigorous testing that essentially happens in a vacuum. The end result is a piece of creative work or design that gets rationalized to death.  A similar thing happens with the client. When it comes to incorporating specific marketing asks into the creative work, there's a lot of client-side anxiety. They have quotas to meet, so they want to hit really hard on all of their price points, selling features, branding elements, buzzwords, etc. That can be frustrating. Creatives in advertising, like anyone else, would love to keep all of their work beautiful, fun, creative, smart, and simple - but unfortunately there's always that ""selling"" aspect to it, so we often have to include those types of elements even though they dilute the final output. That's generally the reason behind most of the crappy advertising you see in your environment. But the mark of a good creative is being able to integrate that kind of ""selling"" information seamlessly into the work, so that it's not obtrusively hitting the viewer over the head. It's hard, but that's essentially what we try to do.
[...what do you think of Mad Men? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2tk76?context=5)|I've found that the most challenging aspect of communicating a creative vision to others, such as clients or accounts people, is that they are unable to imagine it in context, e.g. outside of an agency boardroom. They get really fixated on details (such as all those I mentioned above) and they forget that people spend two, maybe three seconds looking at an ad in the real world. Simpler is generally better when it comes to communicating with people in the public realm, but both the clients and accounts teams usually want to cram as much information into the work as possible. It's tough weeding out what's not essential and convincing them that the brand voice will be heard.
 |I think Mad Men is a decent show entertainment-wise, but not necessarily indicative of what modern-day ad agencies are like. While the job roles are generally congruent - art directors, writers, etc. - one of the main differences now is that they work in tandem to conceptualize projects, whereas before they worked separately and would just kind of fit copy and image together after the fact.
[Do you have any work/ life balance? Is it possible to work at a larger agency and not have crazy long hours? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck3rck0?context=5)|I do have work/life balance. It was difficult when starting out because as a junior you really are given the worst of the worst briefs and it's written between the lines that you're expected to work late into the night whenever possible. In my experience, as you gain progress and become more senior you are given a more reasonable workload, and also learn to manage your day so that you can leave at a reasonable time. However, I will add that the teams at my agency who win the most awards truly dedicate their entire free time to this business. They're in the office early in the morning, late on Friday nights, sometimes Saturdays and/or Sundays. I would say that they probably do not have much work/life balance. Although, they do get to fly to Cannes and other glamorous destinations for award shows every year. I guess for some people, that makes it worth it. It really depends on when your priorities are. If you want to, you can make it a 9-5ish job, but you'd better be pretty damn productive within those hours or eventually you'll find yourself replaced by someone who's willing to work until midnight every night.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm in my first year of a professional career in communications/public relations, but I'm really interested in getting more into advertising/marketing and especially agency work. In university I took a marketing communications class and it was by far my favourite!  What do the communications people in your ad agency do as compared to the marketing/advertising people?  What do you look for when hiring new employees, especially ones who are new to their profession or to the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2wdfe?context=5)|I don't have a lot of contact with the communications people at my agency - if by communications you mean PR/media teams. They're actually separate here but they deal with things like media planning, media buys, launch plans, etc. They are not responsible for creating work but rather deeming appropriate channels and vessels for it, and then crafting whatever is necessary around press and public relations.  I agree with most popular negative opinions on advertising, including the perpetuation of negative stereotypes in race, gender, class, etc. I am also largely anti-consumerist. At the same time, I recognize that it's just one aspect of a larger, destructive consumerist economy, albeit a reinforcing one. For these reasons and more, I have a lot of personal issues with advertising that will probably catalyze my eventual departure from the industry on a corporate level. I am not against advertising as it pertains to the promotion of local businesses, community programs, or humanitarian efforts. I try to do as much of that type of work as is possible.
[I'm currently going into my third year of being a graphic design student - what's your best advice for getting a foothold in the design world and getting your name out there, and do you think it would be possible to secure an offsite, consistent position so I could travel after college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck339yz?context=5)|My advice would be to go to portfolio review nights and get feedback from real Creative Directors, Copywriters, and Art Directors on your portfolio. This is extremely valuable. It's also how I got referred for my first job after university. I'm not sure how this would work in the design world, but you may want to see if there are similar events for graphic design in your city. I would also make sure to have an online portfolio running that you could direct someone to at anytime. Otherwise, email your portfolio to agencies and ask if you can meet with a Creative Director or Head of Design for one-on-one feedback (without requesting a job). You'd be surprised at how many people are willing to take the time to do this for you. It may even lead to a job or internship.
 |In advertising, many people work on short-term or freelance contracts, but they are at the discretion of the agency and I don't think you would be guaranteed anything consistent for longer than 6 months or a year or so. Some agencies allow you to take a leave of absence if you'd like to travel and return at a later date, depending on how much they value you.
[I'm starting Graphic Design college next week; what would be a few tips that give me a better chance for success? I'd love to be able to be self sufficient with that career, but I see a lot of post grads not being able to find any work and ending up doing something completely unrelated. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck33d78?context=5)|While you're in school: read design and advertising annuals. Go to design shows. Set your standards high and expose yourself to award-winning work. Look up Cannes and The One Show, or other international award shows. Dream big - find out which agencies are doing the kind of work you want to be doing eventually.
 |When it comes to design: collect references. Bookmark everything. You need to be immersed in design, constantly absorbing information. Stay curious. Let yourself be influenced by non-design things. Practice your illustration. Practice logos, branding, photo retouching. Read tutorials. Start building your portfolio right now, and watch it transform as you go through school.
 |And most importantly, network! Get your work in front of people who are already in the industry. Get in touch with real Art Directors, Designers, and Creative Directors. Please see my answer to StarvingArtistsInc above for more on this. The younger you start, the better. I got a huge head start on my peers by doing these things early on in my school career.
[Hi! Thanks for doing this AMA; I'm currently in my third year of studying visual communication/advertising!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2vafg?context=5)|I don't know if I can gauge whether the people themselves have gotten more or less creative, however there are so many new types of media, technology, and experiences in general that we can work with, that the potential to create something cool (and far-reaching) is much higher than when advertising was mostly built around traditional platforms, like television. I will say, though, that advances in usability for certain design programs are giving more people the opportunity to be visually creative.
[My question: Do you think advertising - and people in the advertising business - have gotten more creative over the years? Less creative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2vafg?context=5)|One of the great things about working in advertising is that often the brief simply asks you to come up with something really cool. If it's clever or interesting enough, no matter what it is, the team will help you figure out a way to execute it. In fact, the more unique an application, the better the idea comes across.
[In my classes we've studied a lot of excellent ads and directors from before the 1990's, but I can't quite think of any modern ad that gets just as much fanfare from both experts and audiences. Thanks for reading.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck2vafg?context=5)|I want to avoid giving my subjective opinion on specific ad campaigns, but generally international award shows like The One Show or Cannes are good places to look for excellent creative work in advertising. Their websites hold archives from recent years.
[What's the pay difference between copywriting and art directing? Do you feel that art directors get too much credit in awards etc whereas the copywriters are under appreciated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2etoje/im_an_art_director_at_a_top_ad_agency_ama/ck3p9rx?context=5)|At my agency, the pay is roughly the same for both. It depends more on the individual's abilities and accolades. Also, teams usually get pay increases together, provided they pull equal weight in the work.
 |I don't know if the Art Directors get too much credit in the awards, because on every project I've been on, both are explicitly credited in the entry. I guess the layperson might look at advertising and find themselves drawn in more immediately by attention-grabbing visuals without really considering who may have written the copy, but I think for people who are interested in writing (especially other copywriters), clever headlines or an ingenious radio script can be their hook. To me, it's subjective. That said, there is a huge design wing in most award shows that might draw up more publicity for designers and ADs, vs. writers. Perhaps that contributes to a perceived imbalance.

2exqwv,6,2014-08-29,When you apply for internship?,goflvhxj963,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2exqwv/when_you_apply_for_internship/,"Hey guys, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering who had a depressioin for 2~3 years and finally sorted out to start over again. Right now, due to this situation, I wasn't able to get any experience such as research, internship or gain any skills, which leaves me with only my part time job and volunteering at hospital. Due to this I realized that if I just apply online, I will be automatically disqualified so I decided to make a call. Will making a call to hiring manager before applying online make my chance of getting an interview higher as it shows that I'm interested? How should I talk to them?"
2exrzr,6,2014-08-29,Am I just unlucky or is it something else?,slipg,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2exrzr/am_i_just_unlucky_or_is_it_something_else/,"I have been applying for some entry marketing jobs and/or internships for the past year. About 70% of the time I get past the application stage and get to interviews and sometimes I impress them and sometimes not but haven't got any offers since then and their usual response is 'we feel you aren't the right candidate' or 'there is a better candidate'.

I just had a recent interview with a company for a marketing role and I positively sure I did well and their reply back was that they thought I was **over-qualified** for the position. I'm really confused because most of the time I get rejected because I have little experience.

I have a degree in marketing, I have at least a years experience doing marketing for a few small companies and I am always learning new marketing methods online (like seo). One time a HR manager advised me that I should change careers and focus on politics but I feel like I have invested a lot of time and money in my marketing career that I feel that if I changed paths I will be going back to square 1 and my financial status does not help as well.

Just looking for some advice and any actions I should do on my situation. Thanks"
2exyit,1,2014-08-29,Chances of getting position from non-top tier University?,TheFallenPickle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2exyit/chances_of_getting_position_from_nontop_tier/,"Okay, so after reading some questions on here for several months, I am worried about finding jobs/internships from my school. I attend a University that is ranked 70ish in CS. I have a solid GPA 3.7+ and have gotten A's in all my CS courses. I attend career fairs and apply to almost anything that accepts an application and do follow ups, but I never recieve any calls/emails. I don't feel as though I am spectacular at programming, but I am decent and love to code and learn new things and I stress that in my cover letters. What can I do to progressively improve myself and eventually land an internship in the Summer of 2015?"

I am currently a first year CS Engineering student in one of the infinitely many engineering colleges in India, everyone on Reddit encourages to do an internship while in college, so i decided to Google it but the results were fairly disappointing , i couldn't find  many which accepted interns but were rather happy to accept graduates for job, so do you know any which takes 1st or 2nd year Undergrads as Interns.(It would be helpful if they were in Bangalore)                          
Also have you done Internship while you were doing engineering, correct me if i am wrong but it seems that internship is not as common in India as in other countries."
2ey3wc,1,2014-08-29,i'm interviewing people for a job. here's what i want to want them to say/do.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2ey3wc/im_interviewing_people_for_a_job_heres_what_i/,"TL;DR - there are some amazing college grads out there, but i'm shocked by the mistakes some of you are making. 

for the first time in my career, i'm the one holding the reins. 10 years in, i not only get to interview people, i also have final say on who gets hired and who gets passed up. and the jobs i'm filling are the stuff of dreams. they pay startlingly well for entry level gigs (and by entry level, i mean straight out of college with some summer internship experience, and these jobs pay USD $45-$55K with benefits) at a fairly well-known media company with no dress code and a pretty solid 40-hour work week. 

i've talked to more than a dozen candidates who were selected by our HR department first, and have also used my university (both undergrad and graduate) as a networking point to find qualified, intelligent, and generally awesome people to work with. about half of these candidates were really strong. i'll be up until late tonight pouring over which ones i'll hire and which ones i'm going to make sure get hired elsewhere by my colleagues. they made that good an impression. 

then there's the others, which is why i'm writing this right now. they weren't incompetent by any means, nor were they under qualified. but they were terrible in the interviews, and in an environment where the number of applicants is so high and the number of jobs is so low, i think i ought to at least explain what makes an interviewer successful and what makes an interviewer stand out in a pool of a dozen other applicants who on paper are exactly the same. 

**first, be ready to speak to the details of the job post.** if it seems like this is simple and obvious, that's because it really ought to be. i had a handful of candidates from top tier universities (the ivies, USC, UCLA, vanderbilt, etc) and candidates who like me were generally competent people from mid-range schools (UF, loyola chicago, U Mass amherst). at least two from each group of candidates walked in there like they'd just scanned the job post for the first time in the five minutes they spent waiting in the lobby. three people had no idea that the job required some coursework or classes in excel despite it being prominently featured in the original post. one - ironically from the best university in the deck - actually had the balls to ask me what the job was all about. look, i know you guys are stressed and applying to dozens, if not hundreds of jobs. but when you get a callback and you're talking to the fucking hiring manager, have some respect for how far you've actually come and spend 15 minutes going over the damn job post. it's fine to ask me what the pace of your day would be like at this job. it's not OK to ask me what you'd be responsible for when it's in the text of the job post. and it's definitely not cool to say out loud that you had no idea you'd need excel or powerpoint skills when a) it's in the job description and b) you put those skill on your resume. a lot of us fib on our resumes, especially for our first job. but if you're going to lie, be good at it. at least keep track of the lies you put on the resume you altered to match the job description before you interview. know your shit and you'll stand out.

**don't regurgitate overused phrases everyone uses in job interviews. you know what they are.** it's not that they necessarily make you look bad, it's just that i'm not going to remember a damn thing about you if you say the same thing as almost every other applicant out there. you may be thinking ""well, if you don't want a typical answer, why would you ask a typical question?"" i ask that question because i want to know how you would answer it in your own language from your own experience. you're an individual, and you can stand out by being you. when i ask you what your weakness is, don't tell me you ""care too much"" or you ""try too hard."" that's not a weakness. it tells me you are either unoriginal as hell or you didn't bother to prepare for this interview (or both). 
even worse, it doesn't help you stick out or make a case for why i, potential boss who on slow days drinks beer at the office and plays mariokart 64 with my team, should make the decision to spend 8 hours of my day with you. 

so what should you say? the best answer i'd ever heard came from a dude who will probably be hired early next week. i asked him about his weakness and he told me he was really outgoing and could come off cocky, but that he has worked long enough to know that people spend their professional lives trying to get to where they are and that he knew he was just starting out and had lots to learn. the best part was when told me how excited he was just for the opportunity to start his career here. BONUS: he told me had looked me up on linkedin and was especially excited that it could be with me, a person who went to [insert college here] and had [insert experience here]. 

**tell me what you have to offer me.** i already know what i can give you (awesome job, a paycheck, a professional environment where the only things inappropriately ogled are the garlic bagels the company brings in on friday), but what will you give me? seven of the people i talked to told me in no uncertain terms what they'd provide that no one else could. four of them told me without me having to ask. and they were specific about how they'd save me time by engaging our project stakeholders, increasing team efficiency, etc. 

**when i ask you where you see yourself in five years, don't tell me you'd be in my shoes.** first, that falls under the originality point above. second, don't assume it took me 5 years to get here. it actually took me 10. there's a good chance you're smarter and potentially better at this career than i am, but i'm not about to give you a job if you are indirectly claiming to already be better than me at what i do. 

**make me believe you really want to be here.** i'm not saying this because i think this is the best job ever. i want you to make me believe you want to be here because i'm going to spend 40 hours a week with you, and we all want to work with people who have that positive energy. if you don't speak clearly and at least look happy to be here, i'm probably not going to remember you. and if i do, i probably won't have remembered you for something very positive. 

there are so many amazing, talented, and intelligent college grads coming into the professional world. i'm in awe of what some of you are capable of, i really am. but damn, gina, some of your interview kung fu is weak as hell. "

I graduated in May 2014, and have been looking for entry level software development jobs around the Baltimore area as I currently live pretty close by, but most positions I've seen on dice, monster and related sites have pretty much only mid-senior level positions.

I was wondering if there are a decent amount of entry level positions available around California or New York (as these seem to be CS hotspots) that don't require much besides knowledge of a language with mostly in-school project experience and basic CS core knowledge(data structures, algorithms, etc.). I'm asking this as I don't have any internship experience (yeah, I know my bad) and want to learn without being automatically thrust into the deep end. Do many places offer relocation assistance, or prefer that people already live in these places to begin with?

In the case I would a get in job in another location, I'd be a bit reluctant to move having seen CS horror stories in this subreddit, where people have gotten fired within a few months to a few days. Does this kind of thing happen that often, how would someone no experience deal with that kind of situation?

Any kind of answer, advice, or criticism is welcome.

I took some immediate lessons from it and immediately researched the company and exactly what they did, and then researched the specifics of those individual things. I went in, early for the interview, and sat in the waiting area. There were some magazines as well as a book (are you smart enough to work at google?). I picked it up and started reading it. I'm not sure if it inspired me or gave me confidence, but the following interview was fantastic. 



It was clearly a start up vibe as I was being interviewed by a couple younger guys closer to my age. I came off confident, went through my job history, accomplishments, skills and traits very easily. Compared to the day before it was a cake walk. We were getting along very well, and it seemed that I would be a great fit for the office culture.




The position was for a 4 month internship with training and a high chance of transitioning into a full time paid employee. They said without a doubt they were looking to hire once the internship was over. I can survive for a little bit longer with no fixed income, and the skills and paid certification and training received would be an asset regardless, so I took the position when it was offered to me.




I'm feeling pretty good right now. I just want to say thanks to all the people who post their stories and tips in /r/jobs and for listening to my rants when I needed to vent."

Advisors, peers, even the frontpage of reddit all sing the same tune: ""If you don't get an internship during college, your SOL.""  

I'd love to get some insight on the topic of interning as an impetus, or apparently a requirement, for landing a decent CS job after getting a BS in Computer Science.

By next year I will have my CS degree.  While I have experience in a professional workplace through working part-time jobs to help pay for tuition, I have not had any CS internships.  Honestly, I am not sure I really even want a internship...

Instead I'm working in with a research group at my University, and would prefer to continue doing so.  Having talked to friends who have/are interning, the work often sounds mundane and tedious.  They are working under a supervisor in a cube doing the grunt work no one else can be bothered with.  By in large, they can't even point at something and say ""that's mine; I made that"".  Conversely, I am being truly challenged, learning by leaps and bounds.  I am able to interact with graduate/PhD students and professors, gaining exposure to research and paradigms I would otherwise be largely unaware of.  I get to enjoy independently designing, developing, and evaluating systems with the guidance of experts.  But given all the hoo-ha over internships, I am not sure if, for the sake of getting a decent position after graduating, I ought to set aside research for one - especially now that I have one last summer before graduating.  Any professional advice would be great!

I already have a degree economics and am 25, but I was dumb enough not to seek proper internships (I was sick too), that and I left to study language abroad when I was 23, so its basically 2 years of inexperience. 

Anyways, well I got accepted to CS program (3 more years of school, which I really don't want to do, and would prefer to work). I want to get into digital marketing and SEO, but its hard for me to get into especially without technical skills (right now learning HTML, yeah I know lame for you CS guys). 

Reasoning for me to do SEO analyst is I see better career growth for myself and potential. 

So I am stuck with deciding whether to go back to school (3 more years), do a certificate in web design (which might help with being a SEO analyst) or just apply to any other job and learn the technical skills on the side.

I did not where else to ask these questions, so I am here to ask you guys!

I just finished a summer internship at one of the financial companies. Even though people talk shit about finance when it comes to working there as a software developer, I feel like I learned a lot during my time there (technology-wise as well as project management and soft-skills). 

A long story short, I got an offer from them and it's 100k (85k base + 15k bonus). Honestly, don't think this is bad by any means. Personally, I'd take it because I really liked my team and the job aligns with my career plans (work in the industry for a few years and then try to start my own business) and it's also a couple hours away from home meaning that I'd be able to see my family more than once or twice a year without having to spend a bunch of money on plane tickets. This job is also great for long-term career growth in case I decide not to go the startup route. But some of my friends who interned there with me are really angered and shocked (their words) by this offer. They argue that the salary is way too low compared to some of the tech companies and for NYC in general. 

Now, here comes the second part. I can also try interviewing with other firms (mostly on the West coast). A job at one of the tech companies will most likely come with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The pros are (1) working with more exiting projects (2) learning more technology-wise than I would've at a finance company (3) a slightly higher salary. The cons include (1) far from home (2) very unlikely career growth in the long term (from what I've heard) (3) might not get into a good team which would make the whole experience miserable.

As you can see, there are value conflict when I choose either option and I'm having a hard time deciding which one to pick. Any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

So a little bit of back information before I get started.

I was going to previous school before my current one for a couple of semesters and did not do well I was taking alot of irrelevant courses (psych, english's, basic math), I was dealing with depression and alot family problems. I recognized the path I was on was not working so I moved out of state and started new.

I am currently at a local community college with one more semester to go before I finish an Associate in Engineering and transfer to a 4 year. This semester I am taking physics II, materials science, statics and a social science elective and have completed the major maths that I need (Calc I,II, III, Linear, Statistics). Anyways I really want to be on the right track and make sure I am doing everything I should be to be succesfull once I am done with school. 

a) I am guranteed admission to a state school here in Massashuesetts based upon my GPA and my completion of the Engineering program. As far as transferring schools I really would not mind getting into a school with a coop program can annyone suggest the right steps I should take to find an appropriate program? If I cannot get into a coop I would like to stay in either Mass. or go back to NC, can anyone recomend good schools in either regions?

b) I would like to get a job working in or around ME how should I go about applying for internships or coop positions around me? Every application I have sent out online has resulted in no contact. How should I look and find connections to at least get me in the door for these jobs? How can I find HR or other key people, I dont even know where to start. 

Thanks for your time everyone!"

If you're from Kansas City or you've been here, you know that there are many nice people here, but you also know that everyone here is a complete NOBODY. Ever since I turned 4 and began vacationing to other places, I've hated the landscape here. Nearly all of the buildings are short, there are large expanses of land that could be built on but never are, random farms scatter across the ""city"" in places where their presence is an eyesore, and the metropolitan area is very small compared to other cities. As for the activity, there are no famous CEOs, innovators, entertainers, or executives here or from here, there is no big flourishing nationally know business here (except Sprint, but thats besides the point), and there definitely is not an inkling of the Entertainment Industry here. Not to mention, no schools around here have my major. She's over here trying to force me into UMKC and trying to stop me from applying to any out of state (outside of Kansas or Missouri) colleges, also she wants to make me live with her if I go to UMKC - NO. She is going to ruin my entire life. 

She continuously fails to realize that I will be an adult by the time I go to college, and keeps treating me like I'm 12 and like I can't make my own LIFE DECISIONS; she thinks this is HER decision. When I try to tell her she'll say something like, ""I'm done talking about this with you...."" When I present her with information about other schools she'll say, ""Can't you pick somewhere that somebody's heard of..."" (like she can't look something up) or ""How do you know you got the right information, you got that from the internet..."" (as if she could even come close to getting the right information when she barely knows how to use it). I'm the one going to college anyway, why wouldn't I know what I need to do? Why wouldn't I be researching and calculating? She won't even let me know my own social security number, because she doesn't want me going to college else where. She wants the ""happy, peaceful"" life of the average nobody for me, but I want a life that is worth something; I want to be a Music Executive, to be invited to attend award shows like the Grammys, the VMAs, the Billboard Music Awards, etc..., I want to be wealthy and afford a nice condo in New York, I want to fraternize with big name celebrities, I want to have a say in the careers of the aspiring artists, I want to manage the careers of the world famous, I want to get promotions and be revered in the eyes of my co-workers when I am made an executive, and I want to be well-known. Obviously, with such aspirations, I need a school with great internships, which means, I need to go to school on either the east or west coast, and I'm leaning towards the east.

But, most pressingly, I want to start my life and I CAN'T do it here with anyone that I know or that my mother or family knows. I want to be an individual, and I want to be myself, do things that I want, and experience LIFE, but I can't do anything like that in Kansas City. Everyone here is essentially the same; boring, plain, unmotivated to do great things. Everybody's a teacher, a maintenance man, a small business owner etc.. who simply want to be ""happy"", and for some reason everybody knows everybody and each other's mother. I can't live here anymore! I want to go meet new people, and start over. I will not be buried alive under the dirt that is Kansas City. 


I've already began looking into the costs and the likely amounts of merit aid that I'd receive from schools that I can get into. Is there anyway that I can achieve independent student status because my mother refuses to help me if I go out of state?As explained above, this is a must for the sake of my future."
2f1idb,1,2014-08-30,Asking for a raise before graduating,jakadamath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2f1idb/asking_for_a_raise_before_graduating/,"I have been programming seriously for about 3-4 years now and I am going for a bachelors in CS (about halfway through). 2 years ago, I got a job in data entry at a small to midsize company of 50-55 people. After showing my boss that I could program, he began giving me some technical tasks that eventually led to the creation of data mapping software and other programs that help automate every day tasks. I am now a full on software developer at the company and working roughly 30-40 hours per week. 1 year ago, I asked for a raise and they bumped me up from 12 to 16 dollars per hour, which was more than what I asked for. The time has come for me to ask for another raise, but I'm not sure what number to go for. Looking at glassdoor and other websites yields figures from $14 all the way to $40 for interns, but I'm not an intern. Is it reasonable to ask for something in the range of $20 per hour despite not having graduated yet?

To add a little insight into my role in the company: I'm our only in-house developer. We outsource to about 5 other programmers, but I take on the most responsibility because of my availability. I have written 80% of the software that is relied upon by our company to push data into our database. This was previously hand keyed, so it's saving 100's of hours per month in man hours. I also recently led an effort to formalize the software development process by making sure new software projects have stakeholder sign off, proper high-level and technical requirements, versioning using Team Foundation Server, end-user documentation, sandcastle generated documentation, and changelogs. Before this, there was nothing to hold programmers accountable or keep them organized.

How much room do I have to barter for a higher wage?"

I am writing this post, to get some advice from people A. who've gotten the coveted Computer Science degree, B. still working towards it, C. Gave up and found developer jobs, etc. 


In my junior year of college, I decided to minor in CS because of a internship/job dilemma. I majored in economics and it wasn't really helping me land any interviews... I took an information systems class at the college of business and got an A. This is where I first learned about FTP, HTML, and I was immediately hooked. I took that knowledge and created a better website with Dreamweaver &amp; Filezilla. Awesome! 

So, that fall I decided to convert and take the minor. My last Econ class was obviously a pain, and by that point I didn't give two shyts what my grade would be. I think I got a C. The professor was a little looney and no one understood how he graded... But, at any rate I was more excited to take 3 CS courses that fall and continue into the spring. Here are the results: 

**Fall** 
1. web design - B (got mostly 100% A's but blew off final)
2. game programming - A (easy elective)
3. CS1 in C++ - B (the serious, curriculum class

**Spring**
1. internship project - A
2. CS2 in C++ - D! 
3. Linux - C

FINISHED my Bachelors!!!!!!

**Next Fall**, started at another school closer to home.
1. cs1 in java - A
2. discrete structures - W (i withdrew because I was working and the class was structured, compact. the class only met once a week)

**Next Spring**, transferred to another school. For a better challenge.
2. CS2 in Java - D! (This class was really hard, for everyone. The teacher is tough. I would post her ratemyprofessor profile, but for anonymity purposes I don't want to.)


Anyway, I decided to find a job. I landed a very lucrative internship, that pays like a full time career.  And will even pay for me to finish the Bachelor's in CS. My question is, **should I continue immediately, OR wait awhile, if so how long?** I really want this degree, but I am not sure if I've got what it takes to complete Data Structures and other advanced topics successfully. My friends have told me they took Data Structures, two times because it was that hard. I know to have access to higher salary positions I need the degree and I don't plan on staying with this organization forever anyway... I love computers and programming, but I can be a very lazy student. I slack off a lot at the end of every class. So please help with any advice, stories of motivation, etc. What would you do in my situation?

How can I improve and get motivated?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2f1z1k/making_the_step_from_beginner_to/,"I know the easy answer is to simply do it. Think of a problem you have, and then solve it.  One of the issues that I have is that I don't really have too many problems that I can solve with programming.

I'm really trying to make that step from beginner to intermediate, but every time that I have a side project that I'd like to try I get unmotivated really easily. I'm a very hard-worker and my GPA is 3.95~. I keep reading that 'GPA doesn't matter!'. I suppose that is correct, because you can get good grades without doing much. I just feel like my programming ability isn't that great. I can do basic stuff but I've never had any super flashy projects, no android apps, etc. I'm a Freshman transitioning to a Sophomore, and I want to start looking for an internship this summer. I feel this is what will really improve my programming ability a lot.

Sometimes I just don't feel motivated to do things outside of the classroom. However when working for people/in the classroom, I do feel motivated. When I have a job, I feel motivated because someone is dependent on me. So I'm going to try and force myself to get better, because I want to be ready.

I'm complaining a lot I guess. I just feel pretty lost when I start these projects. Then I just end up not finishing them, and then I get even more worried. I genuinely care about my education and my career which is why I try to prepare myself as much as possible, but I just have a hard time with side projects.

I know I want to go into computer science, I just feel stressed about this stuff sometimes. It sometimes depresses me reading on here because it is helpful, but there are so many opinions on what I should be doing that it scares me. I work hard, I care, I do a lot of work. I hear of people who have already had internships, who have a ton of apps out on the market, etc. I also apologize if this post seems all over the place, my mind is kind of racing with thoughts about this right now.

EDIT: I know mostly C++, I guess I'm having a hard time making a project with this language. I know there are so many things I can do, it just seems a little bit difficult to get started. I suppose I should learn frameworks and other things, that would help."

Each work term one was 4 months, so with nearly 2 years of ""real world"" experience I feel like I should be at least a reasonable developer. From what the companies have said about my performance I'm a great developer. Even with other interns, they would come to me to answer their programming questions, and I would usually be assigned more difficult tasks by my manager.

Now I've been reading through interview questions at bigger companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) since I'll be job hunting soon, and I find that I can't answer most of the questions. Even the questions I think I could do correctly I would likely stumble through. My discrete math and big O are fairly weak but I've never ran into trouble working my way around code. From the code I've seen in the co-ops, I have little to no problems understanding and explaining what's happening.


After checking out: [http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/)

I touched on the data structures in the above thread in one of my courses but at most I've only used linked lists, arrays, stacks/queues, and hashmaps, so I can't even remember what a red-black tree is, and I've only actually implemented linked lists and stacks/queues. I don't think I've ever implemented a tree, but I think I could guess-work through it. Is this a big gap? Why have I never run into any trouble with my co-op terms without knowing them? I worked with C, C#, SQL, Javascript, and Python. It seems like from the interview questions these are things every developer should know by heart, but from my experience, I haven't run into anyone implementing them.

Another gap I think I'm missing is algorithms, where in my courses we touched on various sorting/tree traversals, I haven't had to touch them since, so they're forgotten already. Again, it seems like these are things every developer should know by heart, but very few people use them. Maybe it's just the type of work I've run into so far, where it's mostly been not too complex business logic.

Are these all gaps I should be filling just for the interviews? Am I a bad developer for not knowing them? Is it just there's software engineering roles where it's not important to know these things and I somehow ended up in them?"

Take them with a grain of salt as they are from my own experience in college and in the workforce. Just realize that they have worked well for me.

Hi.

You are in business school. Your resume is very important. You should spend many hours on it. I have spent 40+ hours on mine. It has gotten me several high paying jobs so the ROI has been high. If you want to be successful then you will need to do this too. What your resume tells me right away is that you haven't spent much time on it. Fix that. Here are the best tips I can give you.

1. Master Microsoft Word. As a business professional you will use it all the time. Become good at it and it'll help you in amazing ways. Figure out how styles, templates, tabs and spacing all work. Same goes for powerpoint and excel, especially in logistics. Since you are in school you are most likely financially challenged. Here is a link to some good training. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6001871/MICROSOFT_OFFICE_2010_WORD_TRAINING_DVD_[thethingy] Remember someday to pay it forward. Or even on youtube you can find tutorials that would help.

2. You need more on your resume. This is difficult for people in college but the good news is that there are things you can do. Go join a club. Run for an office in that club. Volunteer for something. Put what you did on your resume.

3. Spelling and grammar. It's important. Capitalization and title case. Make sure you are consistent. Make sure you have no errors or inconsistencies. The devil is in the details and that is what sets college people apart since they don't have real world experience. I see a resume with typos and a resume without, I know who I'm more likely to hire.

Formatting: 

1. There are a million ways to format a resume. Take a look at templates and see what suits you. Just don't submit a graphic design resume for a job as a secretary. Simple is good. Make sure it is neat and clean.

2. Google student resumes. There are many people in your situation and it'll call for listing things on it that people in the workforce otherwise wouldn't include. Things like clubs or your GPA.

3. Once you have the content typed out, save it and make several different designs. Through this iteration you'll find what works and what doesn't. The practice in using MS Word helps too.

4. Once you have it looking pretty good, start to pay attention to things like spacing and fonts. Try to follow what this says: http://www.lifeclever.com/give-your-resume-a-face-lift/

**Final and most important tip**
In school, pick a professor/instructor that you find admirable and ask them to take a look at your resume. They might decline, but it won't hurt to ask. If they accept, **ONLY GIVE THEM IT AFTER YOU HAVE ALL YOUR SPELLING/GRAMMAR/FORMATTING** the best you can get it. Their time is valuable and I suggest you don't make them feel like they are wasting it. One of my instructors got me in the door for a high paying internship because he saw how hard I worked in class and in clubs. They are there to help you, just show up after class/during office hours and respectfully ask. Be sure to pay attention to what they tell you. 

Good Luck!  "

Was was very close to landing a Technology Consulting Graduate Position for a Management and Technology Consulting Firm. I recently Graduated with a Computer Science Degree major in Management with Distinction. Long story short, went through the whole process, online application, SHL test's, assessment center, face to face interview etc., there were 4 Applicants, 3 positions, and I was the unlucky fourth and their feedback was, they wanted to take me on, but could only take three, and had to take the candidates who were most suited for their projects at the time! BUT would offer me a position if one of the others didn't accept their offer, but of course they all accepted. They also said, I wouldn't need to go through the whole recruitment process and could go straight through to final interview next intake.

I interpret that the current projects may had been less technical. And on paper, the other candidates may have come from less technical fields, ie. Information Systems Degrees OR may had previous non technical jobs.

Currently I have a graduate position which followed on from an internship I had at the time. This role involves no more coding (but I do mentor the current interns who do code proof of concepts) as this was the direction I wanted to head in within the business, so I am on my way to becoming a Business Analyst (pretty vague term I know, but essentially, knowing everything about a product within the financial Industry).

My question is, next intake period, same company or other rival companies, how do I market myself as a person who has both technical and non technical skill sets?

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2eqrvw/call_me_back_part_3/)

I found out where they are.

I was scrolling through the hundreds of text-notification emails Jake had received, before and after his abduction, when suddenly it hit me.
Jake has a smartphone, what's more it's an *iphone.* I keep hearing about how iphones can be traced back so I don't know why I didn't think of this. 

I guess it just never crossed my mind that the solution would be so easy.

So, anyway, I typed in the email and the password into a site called iCloud which seems to be an app for finding lost/stolen phones and I held my breath.

It brought up a location for Jake's phone.....but you guys will never guess where it said it was.

A hospital.

I drove there as quickly as I could, not even thinking about what I would do when I got there. All I knew was I had to get her out of there. I told the person at the desk that I wanted to see Mary (using her full name of course). The receptionist nurse gave me a look of pity and typed some words into her computer.
I began to feel uneasy - what if she was being kept somewhere else entirely? I didn't know if there was a way to find her then, I was out of ideas.

Then the receptionist called in a nurse who led me to a room in the intensive care unit and suddenly, there she was.

She was lying on a bed with her hands clasped on her stomach. Her eyes had sunken into her head to the point where her face resembled a skull and she looked like she had been completely drained of life.
I immediately rushed over and shook her slightly. Her skin was dry and papery to the touch. She didn't move.

Looking at her notes, the nurse began to ""fill me in on everything""

&gt;**Nurse:** Well, it seems like her coma is a result of traumatic head injury she had received in the car accident. For the time being we have been attempting to maintain her health in the possibility of her regaining consciousness.

&gt;**Me:** It wasn't a car accident or a head trauma.
(That seemed to throw her off guard.)


&gt;**Nurse:** I-I'm sorry sir, but I don't understand what you mean. It says right here-

&gt;**Me:** I don't care what they say, those notes are wrong. This is part of a sick joke.

&gt;**Nurse:** Sir, you've got to try and accept that this is the reality. Running from it, won't change what happened.

&gt;**Me:** Where is the injury?

She began to page through the notes again.

&gt;**Me:** No, don't look at those. Look at her head. There isn't even a bruise. LOOK AT HER.

&gt;**Nurse:** I'm sorry, I'm....I'm only an intern... I....I'm sorry.
She backed away and then rushed out.

I chuckled insanely to myself and then sat and put my head in my hands.

I don't know why I had bothered to argue. It seems that every time I tried to get help I faced more difficulties. I would have to do this myself. I gave Mary one last look....and then sprang into action.

I checked both hallways to make sure they were deserted then I began to check the rooms nearby. The first one contained an old woman, the next two were empty.

Finally, in the last room on the right, there was a man in his late twenties lying in a deep sleep.

If Mary had looked like the life had been drained out of her, this man looked like death itself.

Leaning against his bed was a backpack, which I lunged for, finding his phone easily.

Then I scrolled down his contacts until I found ""Lifepartner (Stephen)"" and called. It took two rings for him to answer.

&gt;**Stephen:** ...Please, no more.

&gt;**Me:** Stephen, it's me. I found him.

I quickly told him the address and the room number. In less than 10 minutes he was there.

He put his shaking hand on Jake's and I explained what I had learned.

Soon after, we had Mary and Jake inspected by doctors who informed us that no, the comas were in fact not because of a car crash or intoxication but rather medical-induced. They were immediately hooked up to I.V.s to counteract their severe dehydration.

When they began to investigate, it was found that neither Mary nor Jake were registered under a doctor, so no one is very sure about how this happened.

Right now I'm watching her sleep. I know I won't be able to - I intend to stay up all night just in case he decides to come back.

I'm scared, for both of us - but for the first time since all of this this began, I can give a sigh of relief.

It's good to know she's safe.


EDIT 1

She woke up!

It was about 5a.m. this morning when she took a large intake of air and shot up into a seated position. I had to stop her from ripping out the I.V. and she almost punched me before she realized who I was.


After many fierce hugs she explained that she only remembered a few things about the abduction - noticing a man-sized shape hunched in the backseat, her attempting to text hoping I could call the police in time, and finally a hand covering her mouth then nothing.

When she was inspected by a doctor, he confirmed that she had made a full recovery and could go home. He said, however, that she should drink *lots* of water and rest up - and try to refrain from any extended physical activity.

I made sure to check in on Stephen and Jake as we were leaving. Jake  had woken up too, although he was not nearly as lively as Mary. They held each others hands as tight as they could and whispered words of comfort.

I smiled and walked out. I don't think they noticed I had come in.

I'm taking Mary home now - her apartment.
 
I can't believe it, but it's really happening.

I think we're going to be okay.

EDIT 2

We're been home for a bit and gotten her settled in. She's been dozing a little bit, but got up about an hour ago to bake a cake for whatever odd reason. (She always did like to go on a cooking frenzy.)

I know I should feel more worried than I am, but I feel confident that Billy has been hindered enough by losing his hold on the cops. I have 911 on speed-dial just in case, but I think the fact that he didn't try anything yesterday is a good sign that he's not going to risk it.

She finally got done with the cake and by god, it's delicious. Vanilla frosting and even sprinkles.

EDIT 3

Well, something wierd happened. Mary was getting a little tireed, and so I helped her to the bed. She cuddled up next to me and gav a content sigh.

&gt;**Me:** You should get some sleep. Thanks for the cake.

&gt;**Mary:** Well, thanks for buying the frosting.

I kind of stopped for s second as she wrnt to sleep - I don't rememdbr getting any frosting?

I also want to show them a portfolio to encourage them to pick me.

People always say that the most important thing is to finish your projects. But I was wondering if I should be concerned about the quality and/or theme of these projects.

Should I try to mimick the kind of games that is made at this studio, or should I try to show my creativity and my ability to create something new and original? You should probably know that I would be applying for an internship with mostly programming.

Since I have a year of free time, I was looking to create some small projects (e.g. an AI tech demo, an audio tech demo, a small 3D rendering engine). But a year is not that much, and if I want to create a game as well, it is very limited.

So what would you do? If you have experience with this, what did you do and did it work out for you?

I'm hoping that this post can be of help to others who are in the same boat, or an inspiration for people's portfolios."

All the 'client' computers were running IE6... 6... 6.

They hired me to do maintenance and in about 2 days I managed to convince the VP External to give me the job of re-writing that entire monster. Took me and the 4 interns I recruited about 3 months to get this monster up. Among the list of idiocies the Intranet 2.0 had to respect:

2. It should use the same database connections and naming conventions (they had some management software for certain departments, like finance and hr, that were dependent on it)
3. DO NOT, EVER, touch the 'app' for ordering/depositing coins and bills (intricate system that connects to finance, a couple of banks, armed truck fleet, partly written in C++ and ASP, a f**king monster)

So, armed with the knowledge that I could do sweet damage to myself if I did anything wrong, I deploy the new intranet (with a 40-question FAQ that was there to prevent 'fun times' at tech support) a Intranet Bible for tech support in case the FAQ misfires or anything goes sour. I was over prepared. 

----------------

2nd of September 2013: Day1:
a few bugs here and there, a few hundred tickets in IT in the genre of ""intranet looks weird and works better, I can't find my secret shortcut to my homepage anymore"" (There was a area in the index page that held an invisible field that would send the user back to the homepage, Easter egg dated 2005 '1am|_33T')

Day2: two bugs, a few dozen tickets in IT in the genre of ""HOW DO I *$menu_item* ON THE INTRANET?""

Day3: refactoring, debugging, pushing to production

Fast forward to Thursday night (Day 11), 5PM, I'm all alone with my only intern (the guy had a 6 month internship that was going throughout the fall) 

Me: Bye $intern, show up to work tomorrow! (the guy was severely scared of black cats, umbrellas inside, and other fun superstitions)

Intern: Goodbye TheOrangeDuke, have a great night!

------------------
Cue Chaos, Friday, 13th of September, 2013

6AM: I get awaken by my house phone ringing. CEO of $company on the phone.

CEO: TheOrangeDuke, come to the office ASAP, the entire intranet is down, and has been down since midnight. I don't know how fast you think you can fix it, but it's not fast enough. *hangs up phone*

Me: Sir, yes, yes, sir. *click* oh no, no, no, not my baby... *shit*

No shower, no breakfast, no coffee, 10 times the adrenaline of skydiving. Get in the car, run red lights, 6:45 I enter the office. Panic in the lobby, I hear noises from the finance/hr floor. If those guys are in this early, that means that fecal matter will be funneled in my throat by noon if I don't get this fixed.

I turn on my computer, everything tests fine on dev branch. Push dev to production. No changes. Open up the server monitoring, we're talking about 10000 errors since midnight. We're talking about the entire Quebec operations STALLED because intranet failure. I'm livid. My boss is livid. The CEO is livid. I look up the ceiling seemed to slowly descend on me. 

I spent the next hour in a trance trying to debug PHP. The intern waltzes in at 8AM. I explain to him what is going on, and what kind of shit I'm in. He cares about me so he starts throwing stuff at the Intranet to see what sticks. He jokes out loud ""I hope there's no Easter egg to mess things up on Friday the 13th."" 

In order to get the Intranet 2.0 rolling ASAP, we ended up using a lot of legacy functions throughout our database accessing interface (that we slowly replaced) so that was a possibility. But we just kept going on... because... who would do that?

At this point, it's 11AM, nothing is working, I am smellier than roadkill skunk, and in the mainly English-speaking department, a French-Canadian strolls in. ""Oui, oui, I changed the database server last week, there was no problem.""

We did tests throughout the year, so this is the most recent change, and it was not on our side cause dev and prod branches were the same. So I start assuming that it's somehow the database server's fault. I get the intern, we throw all our statements at the DB server from the MySQL Workbench directly. And then I read the php line that makes the intranet crash, and I start checking for SQL statements.

""last_access(grab_ip(), fetch_date());""

The database is online... grab_ip() works... fetch_date requests a pre-formatted SQL date from the DB Server, and parses it into a date format. I print the date format.
____________
BOOM

*Ladies and gentlemen, the webpage was effectively initializing the date to be the 9th day of the 13th month.*

The Frenchie who setup the server, had set it up in french, with standard french date formatting... *dd-mm-yyyy* The standard that was used throughout the intranet was *mm-dd-yyyy*. In the entire 150'000 lines of code there was not one check to prevent that from happening. 

""Oui, oui, not my mistake""

A few million dollars and 2 lines of code later...

This is not 'Murica, on est au Québec icitte.

2f3nm4,0,2014-08-31,How do I kickstart my career?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2f3nm4/how_do_i_kickstart_my_career/,"It seems that I just can't get a job in the market. No, I'm serious, I'm feeling frustrated when hearing everyone saying that job market in IT is great for the employees. I'm making 5 EUR/hour (that's 19k $ per year), Eastern Europe (but still European Union). I tried cold approaching, 

Currently, I'm working from bed to bed, remotely at home. So I was on the look for a better job for already 2 months. I received some invitations to apply, but in the end, all of them rejected me (I was invited to only one actual job interview and that one ended with me declining the offer, which was 4 EUR/hour, even less than what I'm making right now).

One thing that I notice - there are almost no system administration jobs around (&lt;10 in the whole country of 3 million citizens, according to the most popular job boards). Almost all of the jobs are development or some help-desk/testing level jobs at banks, which outsource the cheap workforce here. But I don't want to do the monkey's job of reading a script. I want to innovate, contruct, deploy. But it seems that knowing a bit of Python, PHP, Perl, a lot of bash/sh, Puppet, Ansible is not enough. Either the job requires knowing everything - Windows, VMware, Linux, Java (development experience required), KVM or Xen, Cisco and even require certificates for all of it (that's the tip of the iceberg here...).

I am an enthusiastic Linux user of more than 9 years. Started with Gentoo for 4 years and Debian on my servers. Initially I thought that this knowledge would land me a job. It didn't, regardless of all the invested hours. I played around at home with all kinds of setups - Xen, tunneling Skype through Asterisk PBX (back then there was no Skype on Symbian!), automating all kinds of crap like video monitoring. No real development experience, as I always found a way around it. Damn, when I was 16, I took 6th place in national sysadmins' contest (although it was more about ""hacking""). Some of those peers in the top were working in large datacenters back then... 

On top of all of this, I figured that - what the heck, let's diversify this and go for a Bachelor's degree in something completely unrelated. So here I am, I now have BSc in Economics and Business Administration in the top business school in Northern and Eastern Europe (ft.com rankings), which is completely useless. Should I hide it from my CV? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I found that when I don't, I then need to explain why I studied there and not in IT.

A little bit about me: during the studies, I did manage to get a job (paid summer intern) in TeliaSonera. Performed all kinds of VMware, Linux, Solaris administration tasks. Implemented LIO SCSI Target. Helped a lot in PKI management, analyzed a lot of malfunctioning, even solved some big problems. Deployed network monitoring solutions (with my own plugins written in PHP). Other than that, I have also other experience, but this seems like the biggest hit on my CV. I also worked at 4 other firms and performed many major tasks such as data recovery, Puppet infrastructure deployment (""full package"": highly available Puppet backed with self written ENC and PuppetDB), MySQL and MongoDB scaling and high availability, deploying load balancers, etc. Regardless of the experience acquired in spides, working from bed to bed starts to suck. At the very least I would like to be paid better.

I realize that USA is probably out of the question here, given my lack of skills and improper education. However, I'm still lost in what should I do. Should I go for studying something? University (that would obviously require ditching the jobs), certificates?

I'm not too happy about investing half of my monthly wage to certificates, but if that's a must - I can do it. Should I?

What were some obstacles you faced early on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5m8hg?context=5)|I didn't really start a clothing line per-say, at least not in the typical fashion. It all started with these 4chan shirt mockup threads and people wanting them. So, I made a survey to see which ones people wanted and the rest is history at this point.
 |I also plan to continue growing this as a *platform* to submit shirt concepts rather than just retail.
 |I would suggest coming up wth a concept, approaching whatever your market is with that, and see what the interest is. If you can get 1000 responses, then you may have something. I would also suggest not spending any money until you have to. I had made $10k before having an LLC or any expenses really. We designed the original website from scratch and it sucked.
 |USPS gives you free supplies to send priority mail. Order that shiz.
 |Buy polymailer bags.
 |Think twice before accepting most international. There are rules and special shipping stuff that applies to it. I had to learn all that the hard way. I was a shipping noob and opened to all countries from day 1.
 |Shopify + Shipstation (synced) is God mode.
 |Don't listen to your manufacturer. Find the way you want to create shirts and the materials yourself. If I listened to him, I wouldn't have the repeat business I have or happy customers... he wanted me to print on shit shirts he was used to.
 |Always be kind, reward, and be positive with the manufacturer. At least for me.. we're constantly racing to get orders out, and I may be upset with a ton of defect products or something. There is a way to commend someone on their hard work while also moving forward on getting problems solved.
 |I'm sure I could go on. A lot of that advice is operations-based.
 |EDIT: 7. Be organized ahead of most else. I've invested a lot of time and money to make things better organized. It's worth it.

Hate is a strong word, I know I used it, but that job formed a lot of really important skills that I now possess.
[Why is there such a difference in price between different T-shirt printing stores ? Either online or local. I manage 3 slow pitch softball teams. Ordering new shirts/jerseys is a nightmare. Getting quality apparel in a timely manner is Impossible it seems. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5ly30?context=5)|I'm not a manufacturer myself but I can speak on local manufacturers. A lot of them don't know how to price their stuff. Even mine also makes probably the best jerseys I've ever seen for local leagues and he doesn't charge them anywhere near what he should.
 |If I had listened to what others told me when I started without doing ym own research into fabrics and brands, then I wouldn't have as many repeat customers as I do.
 |Also price will vary a lot with what type of printing they're doing. If it's sublimation - the cost is higher compared to silk screening but silk screening has minimum order requirements.
 |The best answer I guess is to do some research, know what printing method you want and potentially the shirt blank itself unless you want it cut and sewn custom. Then you'll cut out the variances in how they'd do it and have a better baseline price.
[What did OP mean by ,""If I had listened to what others told me when I started without doing ym own research into fabrics and brands, then I wouldn't have as many repeat customers as I do.""  Can someone explain... Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck6040l?context=5)|They suggest the cheapest stuff and crap they're used to. I brought in the premium stuff.
[How do you explain to others what you do? Do you say you're a fashion designer? Or a distributor? And were you reluctant to tell people about your idea originally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5l8ew?context=5)|I never wanted to be in apparel actually. While working the corporate finance job, I was constantly doing startups. My previous was a bitcoin company that couldn't land funding.
 |I don't really tell people what I do and I don't go out much anymore. I've seen some people wearing our shirts out now and I just tell them I've seen it and ask to take a pic. I've stayed completely anon about this for the most part - which I prefer since I can do this without any personal agenda.
 |So - mostly I tell people I started a company that is doing well and I am anonymous about it. I'll maybe say it's a user-submitted design website. All of our designs are submitted, voted, and then I license what I can and create the actual designs that we sell.
[How does licensing work for the images on your shirts, particularly if a design seems to have originated from an anonymous source, or if they feature copyrighted material or famous people? Do you have lawyers to help you with this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5lgdf?context=5)|I have both a licensing professional I work with and a local entrepreneur that has been licensing major brands for 20+ years. He's kinda taken me under his wing which is exciting.
 |There is a book I have with all of the relevant licensing contact information I could ever need. It's given out to specific people at some convention but I got it from that guy I mentioned. If something has no trace-able OP or is created anonymously, then it is generally public domain at that point. While we source and vote images, I constantly get incontact with the artists.
 |If something has an OP on reddit, I contact them and wait. I have several designs like that up. I also recreate a lot of them. Blowing up pictures from the internet doesn't work on shirts, so I have to do a lot of deisgn work.
 |Famous people / musicians I mostly just don't have on the website right now. I'm talking to Lil B and Xzibit and stuff though.
 |Copyright is mostly just a business proposition, so it's different basically every time. Unlike most of my competitors it seems... I do this legit as possible. I don't even want cease and desists, that shit gives me anxiety. So It's a pain in the ass but I get the licenses I need, give the money out from it, and sleep well at night. That was a personal decision I made early on and artists thank me for it when I talk to them.
[*I was constantly doing startups.*  What does that mean? Were you just starting a bunch of companies all the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5txrx?context=5)|Until they appeared that they were failures. Yeah. Gotta know when to quit too. Too many people go down with the ship.
[Sorry to hear your Bitcoin startup wasn't successful. May I ask what the startup was about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5v9xy?context=5)|It's okay. The China news hit and the ups-and-downs constantly effected investors. At the end of the day though - I had a lot of professional experience in the industry it was and investors just didn't seem to invest in anything that *used* bitcoin over buy/sell them.
[Will try to buy (s\)one of your shirts with Bitcoin tomorrow. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5v9xy?context=5)|This business is a lot of fun. I'm glad how things turned out.
[You have the St. Elmo's Fire shirt. It has been my phone's wallpaper for almost a year. Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5zd88?context=5)|Just added yesterday. Check out the artist [Robert Bowen](http://www.robertbowenart.com/).

My life is pretty boring right now offline. If you want to ship stuff, we could talk.
[Side rant but I'm gonna sigh looking at fake based wearing those Lil B shirts. But hey, if you can help him make some more moolah and he agrees to it, all the more power to ya bro &lt;3 ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5vrlh?context=5)|They don't do much apparel. Most of the stuff out there is bootleg.
[Uhm the us has not passed orphan works legislation. So op if a design could come back and sue. Just because it has no currently traceable author does not make it public domain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5ywm9?context=5)|Everything is sourced to an ecompassing and reasonable extent, which also holds up in court. I wouldn't be afraid of a lawsuit, if anything I'd get a cease and desist, which I haven't becuase I'm careful. I also recreate a ton of the images by the time they hit the shirts. A majority of our shirts are using licensed pictures I either have agreements for or buy outright online.
 |For example: The bearstronaut is a mix of public domain NASA picture and a bear head I bought and formed onto it to resemble what was orignally submitted.
[It's not just the OPs that can sue, it's the original artists as well -- the Tianenmen Square photographer, the photographer of the rubber ducky, etc. You'll have to be bigger before they care, but they will care.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5z7gv?context=5)|Originated in China, it would be an interesting thing to see I suppose. Most likely a C&amp;D, but by the time the image is ready to go on a shirt, I have to recreate it almost entirely.
[All thanks to the fact that we live in a world where the word ""idea"" and ""company"" became synonymous. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2f3mpt/iama_anon_that_broke_40k_sales_via_shopify_within/ck5vrm0?context=5)|The other companies I had were launched besides one with real products and users. The last one was a really ambitious idea and I made legway in the industry, still wasn't enough to prove to investors.

2f4e0j,2,2014-08-31,Proper etiquette when contacting a recruiter you got through a contact,TopDawgEnt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2f4e0j/proper_etiquette_when_contacting_a_recruiter_you/,"Hi,

I have the email address of a recruiter at a company that I really want to intern for next summer. I got the email through a friend who used to work at this company. I really want to get an interview at this company for an internship, but I don't feel my technical interviewing skills are where they should be. I'm going to spend the next 1-2 months really hammering down on my interviewing skills. 


My questions are:

1. Would it be best to email this recruiter now in regards to a future internship and a future interview, or should I wait until I am ready to interview before I email the recruiter? 

2. I've never really emailed someone like this inquiring for a job, so is their a specific manner in which I should write my email to the recruiter? I don't think I should email the recruiter and just straight up ask for an interview, but I'm inexperienced when it comes to this.

Thank you all!"
